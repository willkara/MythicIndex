## Scene Draft

Thorne found him on the eastern parapet three hours after the battle had ended.

The sun had set behind the city walls, leaving the sky streaked with fading orange and deep purple. The Watch had cleared the dead, tended the wounded, and secured the breaches. Casualty reports had been filed. Debriefings had been conducted. The immediate crisis was over, leaving only the aftermath—exhaustion, adrenaline crash, and the peculiar hollow feeling that came from surviving when others hadn't.

Tomaq sat with his back against the parapet wall, his massive frame somehow looking smaller in the dim light. His armor was piled neatly beside him, cleaned and oiled despite the late hour. His uniform jacket lay across his lap, and in his scarred hands—hands large enough to crush a man's skull—he held a needle and thread.

He was stitching a torn seam in the jacket's shoulder, his movements slow and methodical. And his hands were shaking.

Thorne approached quietly, his boots scuffing stone deliberately to announce his presence. Tomaq's good eye flicked up, tracked his approach, then returned to the needlework without comment.

"Lieutenant," Thorne said, settling down beside him with a grunt. His own body ached in a dozen places, bruises blooming under his armor. "Thought you'd be in the barracks. Or the mess. Somewhere with people."

"Needed quiet." Tomaq's voice was its usual rumble, but there was a thread of something underneath—strain, maybe. Exhaustion. "Sir."

They sat in silence for a moment, watching the needle move through fabric. Tomaq's stitches were small and precise, the kind of work that required fine motor control and concentration. But every few stitches, his hands would tremble, and he'd have to pause, take a breath, and steady himself before continuing.

"How many did we lose?" Tomaq asked finally.

"Seven dead. Fifteen wounded, three critical." Thorne kept his voice neutral, reporting facts. They'd go through the emotional weight of those numbers later, when they had the space to grieve. "Could have been worse."

"Always could be worse." Tomaq completed another stitch, pulling the thread taut. "Doesn't make it good."

"No," Thorne agreed. "It doesn't."

Another long silence. The needle moved in and out, in and out. Tomaq's jaw was tight, his scarred face set in concentration. His hands shook again—worse this time—and the needle slipped, pricking his finger. A bead of dark blood welled up, and he muttered something in Orcish that Thorne didn't catch but could interpret well enough.

"You all right?" Thorne asked.

"Fine." Tomaq sucked the blood from his fingertip, then picked up the needle again. "Just need to finish this."

Thorne watched him work for another minute, recognition slowly dawning. "This is an Ironbrow thing, isn't it? The needlework."

Tomaq's mouth quirked—not quite a smile, but close. "Sir's observant."

"I try." Thorne shifted his weight, easing pressure on a particularly painful bruise. "Saw your tactical notebooks. The embroidered maps. But this is different. You're not mapping anything right now."

"No." Tomaq completed the torn seam and moved to a smaller rip near the collar, threading the needle through with painstaking care. "This is... older. Basic. My father taught me this before I could hold a sword. Said a warrior needs to know how to mend what's broken—gear, wounds, himself."

"Himself," Thorne repeated quietly.

"Ironbrow tradition." Tomaq's hands steadied slightly as he fell into the rhythm of the work. "After battle, after violence, your body remembers the danger. Hands shake. Heart races. Mind won't settle. You can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight. Old warriors called it 'the aftermath shakes.' It passes, but while it's happening, you're useless."

He held up his hands, demonstrating the tremor. "So you do something with your hands. Something that requires precision and patience. Something that can't be rushed. Needlework. Carving. Whittling. The act of focusing on something small and careful—it tricks your body into thinking the danger's passed. Slows your heart. Steadies your breath. Keeps you from falling apart."

Thorne felt something click into place. "Old clan trick."

"Old clan trick," Tomaq confirmed. "My grandfather survived three wars. Spent every evening after battle sitting by the fire, stitching torn gear or carving prayer tokens. Said it was the only way he stayed sane. 'The body believes what the hands tell it,' he used to say. 'Show it you're safe by doing safe things.'"

The needle moved in and out, in and out. Tomaq's breathing had indeed slowed, his shoulders gradually losing some of their rigid tension. The tremor in his hands was still there, but lessening with each stitch.

"Does it work?" Thorne asked.

"Eventually." Tomaq completed the collar repair and examined his work critically before moving to a loose button. "Takes time. But yes—better than drinking yourself numb or starting fights or any of the other ways soldiers try to burn off the aftermath. This way, you end up with mended gear and steady hands instead of a hangover and broken knuckles."

"Practical."

"Ironbrow way." That almost-smile again. "Function over feeling. If you're going to shake, might as well shake while doing something useful."

Thorne found himself watching the stitches take shape, finding something oddly meditative about the repetitive motion. "How long do you usually need to do this?"

"Depends on the battle." Tomaq's voice had steadied too, falling into the same rhythm as his needle. "Quick skirmish? Maybe an hour. Something like today?" He glanced at the torn jacket, at the blood stains he'd scrubbed out, at the evidence of violence barely survived. "Maybe three hours. Four. Until my hands stop shaking and my mind stops replaying every moment I thought I was going to die."

It was perhaps the most emotionally honest thing Thorne had ever heard Tomaq say. The orc kept his feelings carefully controlled, his professional mask firmly in place. But here, in the aftermath of battle, with needle and thread in his hands, the mask had slipped just enough to show the person underneath.

"I lost three soldiers today, Sir." Tomaq's voice was quiet now, almost conversational. "Daniels, Korvash, and young Miriam. She'd been with the Watch for six months. Still learning how to hold a shield properly. I trained her myself."

Thorne's chest tightened. "I know."

"The Watch is my clan now. Clan protects." Tomaq's needle paused mid-stitch. "But I couldn't protect them. Not all of them. And my mind keeps—" He stopped, swallowed. "Keeps showing me the moment Miriam fell. Keeps asking what I could have done different. Keeps insisting it was my failure."

"It wasn't."

"I know that. Rationally, I know that." Tomaq resumed stitching, his jaw tight. "But knowing and feeling are different things. So I sit here, and I stitch, and I let my hands tell my body that the danger's passed and there's nothing more to be done right now. And eventually, maybe in an hour or two, I'll believe it."

Thorne reached out and gripped Tomaq's shoulder—briefly, firmly, the kind of touch that said more than words. "They died protecting this city. Under your command, yes. But also because of your training, your leadership, your example. You taught them to be brave. To hold the line. That's not failure, Lieutenant. That's what honor looks like."

Tomaq met his gaze, his good eye bright with something that might have been grief or gratitude or both. "Thank you, Sir."

"You're welcome." Thorne released his grip and leaned back against the wall. "And Tomaq? When you're done with that jacket—when your hands are steady and your mind's settled—come find me. We'll drink to Daniels, Korvash, and Miriam. Properly. The way they deserve."

"The way they deserve," Tomaq repeated, something like relief crossing his scarred face. "I'd like that, Sir."

They sat together in comfortable silence as the last light faded from the sky. Tomaq stitched, his hands gradually steadying, his breathing gradually slowing. And Thorne stayed, keeping watch, because sometimes leadership meant knowing when to give orders and when to simply be present.

Eventually, Tomaq tied off the final thread and held up the jacket, examining his work in the dim light. The tears were mended, the button secured, the seams reinforced. It wasn't perfect—the stitches showed, visible evidence of repair—but it was whole again. Functional. Ready to serve.

"Good enough," Tomaq said, satisfaction in his voice. He folded the jacket carefully and set it beside his armor. His hands were steady now, the tremor finally gone.

"How do you feel?" Thorne asked.

Tomaq considered the question, flexing his fingers, testing his own state. "Tired. Sad. But... solid. Like I'm back in my own skin again."

"The body believes what the hands tell it."

"Exactly." Tomaq pushed himself to his feet, offering Thorne a hand up. "Thank you for staying, Sir. Didn't have to."

"Yes, I did." Thorne accepted the hand, letting Tomaq pull him upright. "Clan protects, remember? Works both ways."

Something shifted in Tomaq's expression—surprise, then recognition, then deep appreciation. "It does, Sir. It does."

They gathered their gear and headed toward the barracks together, leaving the parapet behind. Somewhere in the city, families were mourning. Wounded soldiers were fighting for their lives. The Watch was preparing for the possibility of another attack. There was still work to be done, reports to file, decisions to make.

But for now, two warriors walked side by side through the quiet evening, having survived another battle and found steadiness in the aftermath.

One needle, one thread, one stitch at a time.

## Implementation Notes

**Cultural Elements Showcased**:
- Ironbrow needlework as psychological coping mechanism
- "The body believes what the hands tell it" philosophy
- Intergenerational trauma management (grandfather → father → Tomaq)
- Function over feeling (practical meditation through precise work)
- Cultural understanding of PTSD symptoms ("aftermath shakes")
- Vulnerability as strength when properly channeled

**Character Development**:
- Shows Tomaq's emotional depth and vulnerability
- Reveals the psychological cost of command

- Deepens Thorne/Tomaq relationship (trust, mutual respect)
- Shows cultural wisdom passed through generations
- Tomaq's identity as both Ironbrow and Watch (clan protects both ways)

**Psychological Realism**:
- Accurate portrayal of post-combat stress response
- Shows trembling hands, intrusive thoughts, emotional processing
- Demonstrates that even experienced warriors struggle
- Cultural practice addresses real trauma symptoms
- Balance between professional duty and emotional need

**Tone**: Intimate, vulnerable, quietly profound. This is a private moment between two warriors dealing with the aftermath of violence. The cultural practice is presented as practical wisdom, not exotic tradition.

**Placement Suggestions**:
- After Chapter 15 (Black Hawks Strike) is ideal
- After any major battle where casualties occurred
- Works best when Tomaq has lost soldiers under his command
- Natural follow-up to battle scenes showing the psychological cost

**Connections to Existing Content**:
- References the embroidered tactical notebooks from Chapter 14
- Builds on "The Watch is my clan now" philosophy from Chapter 14
- Shows the practical/psychological dual purpose of Ironbrow needlework
- Deepens the Thorne/Tomaq dynamic established in earlier chapters

**Thematic Resonance**:
- Cultural traditions serve survival purposes (psychological as well as tactical)
- Leadership includes vulnerability and mutual support
- "Mending what's broken" applies to gear, wounds, and self
- Clan protects works both ways—community support during trauma

**Length**: ~2,200 words, substantial scene with emotional depth while remaining focused

**Writing Notes**:
- Contrast between Tomaq's physical size/strength and emotional vulnerability
- Show the trembling hands visually throughout
- Use the rhythm of stitching as pacing device (speeds up as he calms)
- Thorne's silent support is as important as his words
- End on recovery/solidarity rather than dwelling in trauma
