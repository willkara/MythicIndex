## Scene Draft

The Wayward Compass looked exactly as they'd left it—warm lamplight spilling through clean windows, the scent of bread and stew heavy in the air, the low murmur of satisfied conversation. The Company had been on the road for three weeks since their last visit, and Thorne had insisted they stop here for a proper meal and a night's rest before the final push to the capital.

They'd barely crossed the threshold when Durja's voice rumbled from behind the bar.

"You look thin."

Veyra blinked. She'd actually gained weight since their last visit, thanks to Aldwin's insistence on regular meals and his tendency to sneak extra portions onto her plate when he thought she wasn't looking. "I... we're eating well, actually."

Durja made a dismissive sound in the back of her throat, her amber eyes sweeping across the Company with the practiced assessment of someone who'd been feeding travelers for five decades. "Everyone looks thin after three weeks on the road. Sit. I'll bring food."

There was no arguing with that tone. They found their usual table—somehow still available despite the tavern being fairly busy—and settled in. Within moments, Durja appeared with a tray laden with bowls of her famous stew, fresh bread, sharp cheese, and what looked like an entire roast chicken that definitely hadn't been on the menu board.

"This is too much," Thorne said, though his eyes had already locked onto the chicken with unmistakable interest.

"Then take it with you tomorrow." Durja set the tray down with decisive finality. "Road ahead is two days through hill country with no decent inns. You'll need provisions. I'm not having folk leave my hearth hungry and then regret it in the wilds."

She returned to the bar, and they ate in comfortable silence, the kind that came from exhaustion and good food. Veyra was halfway through her second bowl of stew—which was, admittedly, incredible—when she noticed Elara watching Durja with open curiosity.

"Something on your mind?" Veyra asked.

Elara nodded toward the bar, where Durja was pulling a pint with methodical precision. "The rings on her tusks. I've been wondering about them since our first visit. Five rings on the left tusk, all copper. It seems too deliberate to be just decoration."

Veyra followed her gaze. The copper rings caught the lamplight, gleaming dully against the bone. "I noticed those too. Cultural significance, maybe?"

"Only one way to find out." Elara rose, collecting her empty bowl, and headed to the bar. Veyra and Thorne exchanged glances—curiosity winning over exhaustion—and followed.

Durja accepted the empty dishes with a grunt of approval. "Good. You actually ate. Half the folk who come through here pick at their food like sparrows. Waste of good cooking."

"It was excellent," Elara said, and meant it. "Durja... if it's not rude to ask... the rings on your tusks. Do they mean something?"

Durja's scarred hand rose instinctively to her left tusk, fingers brushing the smooth copper rings. For a moment, Veyra thought she might deflect or dismiss the question. But then the orc's expression softened—not quite a smile, but something close to it.

"Hearthstone tradition," she said, her gravelly voice taking on a note of quiet pride. "One ring for every decade of service. Five rings means I've been keeping hearth for fifty years."

"Fifty years," Thorne repeated, his tone respectful. "That's... impressive."

"It's duty." Durja poured herself a small glass of water, taking a measured sip before continuing. "Hearthstone Clan doesn't mark warriors or hunters or scouts. We mark those who feed, shelter, and protect the community. My grandmother had nine rings when she passed. Ninety years keeping the clan hearth, feeding travelers, settling disputes, making sure everyone had a place to sleep and a full belly."

She tapped her left tusk, the rings making a soft chiming sound. "These aren't decorations. They're a record. A promise. Five decades of making sure no one who came to my door left hungry. Five decades of keeping this place safe and warm and welcoming."

Elara's eyes had gone wide. "That's beautiful."

Durja snorted, but there was no real derision in it. "It's practical. Hearthstone way is simple: hearth feeds, hearth protects, hearth endures. You can't have a community without someone willing to maintain the foundation. Food, shelter, basic hospitality—those aren't luxuries. They're necessities. Someone has to provide them."

"Feed them, then judge them," Veyra said, remembering the phrase from their first visit.

"Exactly." Durja's amber eyes fixed on her with approval. "Can't know someone's character on an empty stomach. Hunger makes folk desperate, makes them lie, makes them cruel. But a full belly? That's when you see who they really are. So I feed everyone who comes through that door. Then I decide if they're welcome to stay."

"And if they're not welcome?" Thorne asked, though his tone suggested he already knew the answer.

"Then they leave with a full stomach and provisions for the road, but they don't come back." Durja's stance shifted slightly—nothing obvious, but Veyra had learned to read the subtle body language of dangerous people. "Hearth protects. That's not just about hospitality. It's about knowing when someone threatens the safety of your people and handling it before it becomes a problem."

She glanced toward the back of the bar, where Veyra knew the old Hearthstone war-club rested. Durja had never needed to use it—but everyone who'd spent time in the Compass knew it was there.

"I've never seen you wear them on the right tusk," Elara observed. "Is that significant?"

"Right tusk is for personal milestones. Marriage, children, major life changes outside of service." Durja's expression flickered with something Veyra couldn't quite read. "Never had reason to mark that side. The hearth was always enough."

There was a weight to that statement, a life's worth of choices made and paths not taken. Veyra found herself wondering what Durja had sacrificed to maintain this place for fifty years, what opportunities she'd set aside to ensure travelers had somewhere safe to rest.

"My mother tried to talk me into leaving when I was younger," Durja continued, her tone matter-of-fact. "Said I could join a merchant caravan, see the world, make real money instead of running a tavern in a waypoint town. But Hearthstone doesn't abandon the hearth. Someone had to keep this place running after old Krag retired. So I stayed."

She picked up a cloth and began polishing the bar with practiced, methodical movements. "Fifty years. Thousands of travelers. Fed them all. Sheltered them all. Kept them safe from bandits, weather, their own poor decisions. That's worth more than seeing the world. That's worth the rings."

"It is," Thorne said quietly. "What you do here—it matters. We needed this place. A safe haven, no questions asked, just... kindness and good food. That's rarer than you'd think."

Durja's scarred face actually did smile then, brief and genuine. "Hearth endures. That's the last part of the saying. Kingdoms rise and fall. Wars come and go. But there's always need for a place where folk can rest, eat, and remember they're more than just soldiers or travelers or whatever role the world's forced on them. As long as there's need, I'll keep the hearth."

She set down the polishing cloth and reached beneath the bar, producing a cloth-wrapped bundle. "Which is why you're taking this tomorrow morning. Fresh bread, dried meat, cheese that'll keep for a week, and a flask of my grandmother's recipe for fortified broth. Two days through hill country, you said? This'll see you through with enough left over for an emergency."

"Durja, you don't have to—" Veyra started.

"Hearth feeds. Not up for debate." Durja's tone brooked no argument. "You paid for your meals and your rooms. This is something else. This is making sure you don't spend two days eating trail rations and cursing the road. Call it professional pride."

"Call it five decades of knowing exactly what travelers need," Elara said warmly.

"That too." Durja pushed the bundle across the bar toward Veyra. "Now go get some rest. Breakfast is at dawn, and I won't have you leaving here without a proper meal to start the day."

They returned to their table, the bundle safely in Veyra's hands, and finished their meal in thoughtful silence. Veyra found herself watching Durja move through the tavern—checking on patrons, refilling drinks, clearing tables with the efficient grace of long practice. Fifty years of this. Fifty years of feeding strangers, protecting her community, maintaining a safe haven in a dangerous world.

Five copper rings, and every one of them earned.

Later, as they were heading upstairs to their rooms, Thorne paused beside Veyra. "Makes you think, doesn't it?"

"About what?"

"Value. Worth." He glanced back toward the common room, where Durja was banking the fire for the night. "The world celebrates warriors and heroes, people who do dramatic things. But someone like Durja? Fifty years of quiet service, making sure travelers have a place to rest? That's heroism too. Just a different kind."

Veyra looked down at the cloth bundle in her hands—provisions prepared with care, sent with them not because she had to, but because hearth feeds. "Hearthstone Clan has the right idea."

"They do," Thorne agreed. "Feed them, protect them, endure. Not a bad philosophy for any of us, really."

That night, Veyra slept in a clean bed under a solid roof, her belly full and her mind at ease. And in the morning, when Durja pressed a final package of fresh rolls into her hands and told her she still looked thin, Veyra didn't argue.

Some battles weren't worth fighting. Especially not against fifty years of Hearthstone hospitality.

## Implementation Notes

**Cultural Elements Showcased**:
- Hearthstone Clan copper ring tradition (one ring per decade of service)
- "Hearth feeds, hearth protects, hearth endures" philosophy
- "Feed them, then judge them" principle from Chapter 10 reinforced
- Hospitality as duty and honor, not just kindness
- Practical care (provisions for the road) as cultural expression
- Service over adventure as a valid life choice

**Character Development**:
- Reveals Durja's 50 years of dedication to her hearth
- Shows the sacrifices she made (staying instead of traveling)
- Demonstrates her grandmother's influence (nine rings, 90 years)
- Explains why she's so protective of the Compass
- Shows her reading people through feeding them

**Tone**: Warm, respectful, quietly proud. Durja's life choices are presented as equally valid to the Company's adventuring life—different paths, equal worth.

**Placement Suggestions**:
- Any chapter after Chapter 10 where the Company is traveling through the region
- Works well as a "breather" scene between intense action sequences
- Natural stopping point during longer journeys
- Could be expanded to include other characters' reactions

**Connections to Existing Content**:
- References the Hearthstone war-club mentioned in Chapter 10
- Reinforces "Feed them, then judge them" from Chapter 10
- Shows the Compass as an established safe haven
- Builds on Durja's existing characterization

**Length**: ~2,000 words, substantial enough to feel like a complete character moment while remaining focused on cultural revelation

**Thematic Resonance**: Contrasts Durja's "quiet heroism" of 50 years service with the Company's more dramatic heroics—both are valuable, different expressions of duty and honor.
