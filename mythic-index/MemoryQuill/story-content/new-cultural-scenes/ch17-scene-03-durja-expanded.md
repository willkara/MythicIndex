## PART 1: ARRIVAL (Keep existing content, lines 95-135)

Dusk was settling as they reached the crossroads after four days of slow evacuation with their wounded, twice the normal travel time but necessary for careful transport. The Wayward Compass stood as it always had, a squat, solid presence against the fading light. Smoke curled from its chimneys, promising warmth and ale.

The sheer size of their column brought the inn's few patrons to the windows. When Thorne, his face a mask of road dust and fatigue, pushed open the door, the common room fell silent. Every eye turned to him, then to the sea of armed soldiers and wounded rescuers visible behind him.

Durja, the orc innkeeper, was wiping down the bar with a rag. She looked up, her scarred face taking in Thorne, then Veyra behind him, then the unmistakable form of Grimjaw, and finally the uniformed presence of Commander Atlock. She paused, her gaze sweeping over the forty cavalrymen visible in the twilight. She put down her rag with deliberate slowness, placed both massive hands on the bar, and sighed. The sound was a low rumble of profound, bone-deep weariness.

"For fuck's sake," she said, her voice carrying across the silent room.

A choked laugh escaped Grimjaw. Before the bewildered Commander Atlock could fully process the greeting, Marcus Heartbridge stepped smoothly forward, his expensive clothes looking utterly out of place and yet perfectly natural.

"My dear Durja," he began, his voice a balm of pure, practiced charm. "A sentiment we all share, I assure you. To descend upon your legendary oasis of tranquility like a conquering army is a crime against hospitality, one for which we must atone."

Durja gave a slow, deliberate eye-roll that conveyed years of dealing with smooth-talkers. "Get on with it, peacock."

Marcus's smile didn't falter. "Right. We need provisions for eighty, a round for everyone in this fine establishment for their patience, and your boundless tolerance." He slid the heavy purse across the bar. "And this, for the crime."

Durja eyed the purse, then Marcus's unshakeable smile, and gave a single, sharp nod. The gold was practical, but the apology, however flowery, was noted. Grimjaw walked past Marcus, clapping him on the shoulder. "You fight with your tongue and your purse, peacock. Can't argue with the results."

While the massive order was being prepared, Durja cleared a large table in the corner for the Company's core leadership. Atlock, Veyra, Thorne, Tomaq, Grimjaw, Aldwin, and Fayne sat down, a council of the exhausted. Hot stew and cold ale were brought, and for a few minutes, the only sounds were the scraping of spoons and weary sighs.

Atlock took a long pull of his ale. "Better than field rations," he grunted to Thorne.

"Aye, but not by much," Grimjaw grumbled, poking at a piece of gristle in his bowl. "Tastes like they boiled an old boot in it."

Tomaq let out a low chuckle. "Heard you lost a boot in the north wall collapse, Grimjaw. Maybe you're finally reunited."

The dwarf shot him a look that was somehow both murderous and amused, before returning to his meal. Across the table, Aldwin noticed Veyra was just pushing the stew around her bowl. Without a word, he slid his own untouched piece of bread over to her plate. Veyra gave him a small, grateful nod and finally took a bite.

Atlock surveyed the table—the battered, bruised, and utterly spent heroes of Westwall. A rare, weary smile touched his face. "Gods, look at us. A right mess."

"The finest mess I've ever had the honor to serve with, Commander," Thorne replied, his voice quiet but firm. The respect for the rank was there, but the tone was one of deep, personal camaraderie.

## PART 2: THE COPPER RINGS (NEW CONTENT - Insert here)

As the meal wound down and the leadership table's conversation turned to logistics and tomorrow's plan, Archer Venn appeared at the table, her usual smirk tempered by exhaustion. "Commander, the men are settled outside. Cavalry's setting up perimeter watch rotation."

"Good," Atlock said. "Join us. You've earned a proper seat."

Venn pulled up a chair, gratefully accepting the bowl of stew Durja brought without being asked. "You look thin," Durja said, the words a formality. She set down the bowl with a basket of bread. "Eat."

It was the same greeting she'd given them on their first visit weeks ago, and despite everything, Venn found herself smiling. "Thank you, Durja."

The orc innkeeper grunted acknowledgment and turned to refill Atlock's ale. As she leaned across the table, the lamplight caught the copper rings adorning her left tusk—five of them, gleaming dully against the bone.

Venn's eyes followed the movement, curiosity finally overcoming exhaustion. "Durja... if it's not rude to ask... the rings on your tusk. Do they mean something?"

Durja's scarred hand rose instinctively to her left tusk, fingers brushing the smooth copper rings. For a moment, Venn thought she might deflect or dismiss the question. But then the orc's expression softened—not quite a smile, but something close to it.

The question had drawn the attention of the entire table. Even Atlock looked up from his ale with interest.

"Hearthstone tradition," Durja said, her gravelly voice taking on a note of quiet pride. "One ring for every decade of service. Five rings means I've been keeping hearth for fifty years."

"Fifty years," Thorne repeated, his tone respectful. "That's... impressive."

"It's duty." Durja poured herself a small glass of water, taking a measured sip before continuing. "Hearthstone Clan doesn't mark warriors or hunters or scouts. We mark those who feed, shelter, and protect the community. My grandmother had nine rings when she passed. Ninety years keeping the clan hearth, feeding travelers, settling disputes, making sure everyone had a place to sleep and a full belly."

She tapped her left tusk, the rings making a soft chiming sound. "These aren't decorations. They're a record. A promise. Five decades of making sure no one who came to my door left hungry. Five decades of keeping this place safe and warm and welcoming."

Venn's eyes had gone wide. "That's beautiful."

Durja snorted, but there was no real derision in it. "It's practical. Hearthstone way is simple: hearth feeds, hearth protects, hearth endures. You can't have a community without someone willing to maintain the foundation. Food, shelter, basic hospitality—those aren't luxuries. They're necessities. Someone has to provide them."

"Feed them, then judge them," Veyra said quietly, remembering the phrase from their first visit.

"Exactly." Durja's amber eyes fixed on her with approval. "Can't know someone's character on an empty stomach. Hunger makes folk desperate, makes them lie, makes them cruel. But a full belly? That's when you see who they really are. So I feed everyone who comes through that door. Then I decide if they're welcome to stay."

"And if they're not welcome?" Atlock asked, though his tone suggested he already knew the answer.

"Then they leave with a full stomach and provisions for the road, but they don't come back." Durja's stance shifted slightly—nothing obvious, but Veyra had learned to read the subtle body language of dangerous people. "Hearth protects. That's not just about hospitality. It's about knowing when someone threatens the safety of your people and handling it before it becomes a problem."

She glanced toward the back of the bar, where Veyra knew the old Hearthstone war-club rested. Durja had never needed to use it in the three times they'd visited—but everyone who'd spent time in the Compass knew it was there.

"I've never seen rings on your right tusk," Aldwin observed gently. "Is that significant?"

"Right tusk is for personal milestones. Marriage, children, major life changes outside of service." Durja's expression flickered with something Veyra couldn't quite read. "Never had reason to mark that side. The hearth was always enough."

There was a weight to that statement, a life's worth of choices made and paths not taken. Veyra found herself wondering what Durja had sacrificed to maintain this place for fifty years, what opportunities she'd set aside to ensure travelers had somewhere safe to rest.

"My mother tried to talk me into leaving when I was younger," Durja continued, her tone matter-of-fact. "Said I could join a merchant caravan, see the world, make real money instead of running a tavern in a waypoint town. But Hearthstone doesn't abandon the hearth. Someone had to keep this place running after old Krag retired. So I stayed."

She picked up a cloth and began polishing a tankard with practiced, methodical movements. "Fifty years. Thousands of travelers. Fed them all. Sheltered them all. Kept them safe from bandits, weather, their own poor decisions. That's worth more than seeing the world. That's worth the rings."

"It is," Commander Atlock said quietly, and there was genuine respect in his voice. "What you do here—it matters. We needed this place. A safe haven, no questions asked, just... kindness and good food. That's rarer than you'd think."

Durja's scarred face actually did smile then, brief and genuine. "Hearth endures. That's the last part of the saying. Kingdoms rise and fall. Wars come and go. But there's always need for a place where folk can rest, eat, and remember they're more than just soldiers or travelers or whatever role the world's forced on them. As long as there's need, I'll keep the hearth."

Grimjaw raised his ale in salute. "To fifty years of service. May the hearth never grow cold."

"To the hearth," the table echoed, raising their drinks.

Durja acknowledged the toast with a nod, then set down the polishing cloth and reached beneath the bar. She produced two cloth-wrapped bundles, setting them on the table.

"What's this?" Veyra asked.

"You're heading to Waterdeep tomorrow. Two days' travel with wounded who need gentle transport." Durja unwrapped the first bundle, revealing fresh bread, dried meat, cheese wrapped in wax paper, and a sealed flask. "This is making sure you don't spend two days eating trail rations and cursing the road. The flask is my grandmother's recipe for fortified broth—good for the wounded, keeps their strength up."

"Durja, you don't have to—" Thorne started.

"Hearth feeds. Not up for debate." Durja's tone brooked no argument. "You paid for your meals and your beds tonight. This is something else. This is making sure you don't arrive in Waterdeep looking like refugees. You're heroes, whether you accept that or not. You'll arrive fed, rested, and ready. That's how you honor what you've done."

"Call it five decades of knowing exactly what travelers need," Venn said warmly.

"That too." Durja pushed the bundles across the table toward Veyra and Thorne. "Now. You've got rooms upstairs—cleared out the best ones we have. Not fancy, but the beds are clean and the blankets are thick. Your wounded are settled in the barn with fresh straw and braziers for warmth. My staff will check on them through the night."

She paused, her amber eyes sweeping across the battered, exhausted faces at the table. "You fought well. You survived. Now let someone else take care of you for one night. That's an order."

Atlock actually laughed—a short, surprised bark of sound. "I like her," he said to Thorne. "She gives orders like she expects them to be followed."

"Fifty years keeping hearth for travelers, Commander," Durja replied. "You learn when someone needs ordering about. Now. Upstairs. All of you. Before I decide you're too stubborn to help and throw you out."

Veyra stood, picking up one of the bundles. "Thank you, Durja. For everything."

"You're welcome. Come back when you're not bleeding all over my floor." But the words were said with warmth, and when Veyra met her eyes, she saw genuine care there. "And when you do, you'll tell me the full story of what happened at Westwall. I've heard bits and pieces from the road, but I want the truth from people who were there."

"Deal," Veyra said.

As they headed upstairs, Venn paused beside Durja at the bar. "Fifty years is a long time to keep a hearth."

"It is," Durja agreed.

"Worth it?"

Durja looked around her inn—the worn but clean tables, the fire crackling in the hearth, the handful of regular patrons who'd stayed despite the chaos of eighty unexpected guests, the Company members scattered throughout finding warmth and food and safety.

"Every single day," she said simply.

Later, as Veyra lay in the first real bed she'd slept in since the battle, she thought about copper rings and fifty years of service. About choosing to stay when you could have gone. About feeding strangers and calling it duty when it was clearly so much more.

Five copper rings, gleaming in lamplight. Five decades of hearth feeds, hearth protects, hearth endures.

Some battles weren't fought with swords. Some heroes never left home.

And both were equally worth honoring.

## Integration Instructions for Chapter 17

**How to Integrate**:
1. Keep existing Scene 17-03 opening (lines 95-135) - "For Fuck's Sake" through the leadership meal
2. Insert "PART 2: THE COPPER RINGS" after Thorne's line "The finest mess I've ever had the honor to serve with, Commander"
3. This adds ~2,000 words to the existing ~400-word scene
4. Total scene length: ~2,400 words

**Timeline**:
- Existing: "Dusk" / "Evening of Day 6 after battle"
- Expanded: Same timing, just extends the evening's events at the Wayward Compass
- Fits within Chapter 17's "Month 4 (Early Spring, Day 4-5)" range

**Why This Expansion Works**:
1. Chapter 17 ALREADY includes a Wayward Compass stop - this just deepens it
2. Natural moment for cultural revelation during the meal
3. Company is exhausted, wounded - makes Durja's care more meaningful
4. Durja is already a named character in the scene
5. Parallels the themes of "journey," "camaraderie," "aftermath"
6. Shows "quiet heroism" theme - Durja's 50 years vs. Company's dramatic battles

**Key Connections**:
- References "Feed them, then judge them" from Chapter 10
- Shows the Hearthstone war-club mentioned in Chapter 10
- Builds on existing Durja characterization
- Provides provisions for the journey (practical detail)
- Creates emotional beat before arriving in Waterdeep

**Thematic Function**:
- Contrasts Durja's "quiet heroism" (50 years service) with Company's dramatic battles
- Both forms of service are valuable - different paths, equal worth
- "Hearth feeds, hearth protects, hearth endures" as life philosophy
- Choosing to stay and serve vs. choosing to adventure - both valid
- Community care as form of strength

**Character Development**:
- Reveals Durja's 50 years of dedication and sacrifice
- Shows her grandmother's influence (9 rings, 90 years)
- Explains why she's so protective of the Compass
- Demonstrates her reading people through feeding them
- Deepens relationship with Company - they're not just customers

**Length**: Adds ~2,000 words to existing ~400-word scene, total ~2,400 words
- Chapter 17 is currently only 2,351 words and marked "in-progress"
- This expansion would more than double the chapter length
- May want to add this as foundation for expanding other scenes too

**Technical Notes**:
- Maintains Chapter 17's veyra-thornwake POV (ends with her reflection)
- Uses same scene comment format
- Durja already in key_characters list
- Fits motifs: aftermath, journey, camaraderie
- Location: wayward-compass (already listed)

**Characters in Scene**:
- All already in Chapter 17's key_characters list
- Adds Archer Venn (minor addition) as the one who asks about rings
- Commander Atlock's presence makes the moment more significant (official recognition)

**Alternative Approach**:
If the ~2,400-word scene feels too long for one sequence, could split into:
- Scene 17-03: "For Fuck's Sake" (arrival, meal, existing content)
- Scene 17-03.5: "The Copper Rings" (cultural revelation, provisions)
- Both at same location/timeframe, just separated for pacing
