The sanctuary's back room smelled of chamomile and clean linen. Aldwin had cleared his usual worktable, spreading out neat rows of supplies: small cloth bags, packets of tea wrapped in waxed paper, honey in tiny sealed jars, clean handkerchiefs, leather cord, and a small mountain of dried fruit.

Mistress Elba paused in the doorway, arms full of fresh bandages from the community donations. "Chief? What's all this?"

"Care packages," Aldwin said, his nimble fingers already assembling the first kit with practiced efficiency. "For the lads who'll be heading home over the next week. The ones who took injuries but are well enough to travel." He glanced up, his weathered face creasing into a smile. "Come on, then. Set those down and give me a hand. I'll show you how it's done."

Elba set the bandages aside and approached the table, eyeing the supplies with curiosity. "I've never seen you do this before."

"That's because we haven't had a proper battle aftermath to recover from since you arrived." Aldwin's hands moved with the sort of automatic precision that came from decades of repetition. Chamomile packet into the bag. Honey jar wrapped in cloth. Three pieces of dried apple. One clean handkerchief. Leather cord to tie it shut. "My gran taught me this during her time with the Highland Regulars. She said food and tea fix half of what ails folk, and the other half just needs time and kindness. These little kits? They're both."

He held up the completed package, no bigger than his palm. "Small enough to fit in a pocket, light enough not to burden an injured man. But when they're three days into the road home and their wounds are aching and their spirits are low, they can brew a cup of tea, have a bit of sweetness, and remember someone cared enough to send them off proper."

Elba picked up a cloth bag, attempting to mimic Aldwin's assembly process. Her fingers fumbled with the tea packet. "How much of each?"

"Enough for three good cups of tea, enough honey to last those three cups, enough dried fruit to settle the stomach if the journey's rough." Aldwin watched her work, then gently corrected the placement of the honey jar. "Honey goes in the center, wrapped in cloth. That way if the jar cracks—which it might—the cloth catches it and keeps the tea dry. Everything you need, nothing you don't. That's the principle."

"Everything you need, nothing you don't," Elba echoed, adjusting her assembly. "Is that another one of your gran's sayings?"

"It's a halfling saying, but Gran lived by it." Aldwin reached into one of his waistcoat's many pockets—this one at mid-chest on the left side—and pulled out a small tin of salve. "That's why the pockets are organized the way they are. Everything exactly where I need it, nothing extra weighing me down."

Elba had been working with Aldwin long enough to be fascinated by the waistcoat. Everyone in the Company knew about it—the legendary garment with more pockets than seemed physically possible, each one containing exactly the right supply at exactly the right moment. "How many pockets does that thing actually have?"

"Seventeen functional pockets, if you count the interior ones." Aldwin's eyes twinkled with quiet pride. "Each one serves a purpose. Top left? Needle and thread for emergency sutures. Top right? Bandage scissors. Mid-chest left, where my hands naturally rest? Salves and tinctures I need most often. Lower pockets? Larger supplies, bandages, splints. The interior ones? Personal items, backup supplies, things I don't need every day but can't be without."

He demonstrated, patting pockets as he listed them. "The weight's distributed so it doesn't throw off my balance. The placement means I never have to fumble or search—my hands know where to go. When someone's bleeding out, seconds matter. Can't waste time digging through a bag."

"That's..." Elba tied off her first completed care package, examining it with satisfaction. "That's brilliant, actually. Battlefield-practical."

"Exactly." Aldwin began assembling the next package, his voice taking on the patient tone of a teacher who genuinely enjoyed teaching. "My gran used to say halflings make the best field medics not because we're naturally skilled healers—though we are—but because we understand that preparation and organization save more lives than heroic improvisation. Have what you need, know where it is, and you'll be ready when crisis comes calling."

They worked in companionable silence for several minutes, Elba's assembly speed increasing as she learned the rhythm. She'd completed her fourth package when she ventured, "Is that why you always have tea ready? And those little candies you hand out?"

"Food and tea fix half of what ails folk." Aldwin smiled. "A soldier who's terrified, exhausted, or grieving? Sometimes what they need isn't medicine—it's someone to sit with them, hand them something warm and sweet, and remind them they're still human. Still cared for. My gran called it the 'basics of being alive' treatment. You'd be surprised how often folk forget the basics under stress."

Elba's next package came together smoothly. "So these aren't just care packages. They're... reminders?"

"That someone saw them. That their service mattered. That even though they're heading home with injuries that might ache for the rest of their lives, they were part of something that valued them enough to send them off with tea and honey." Aldwin tied off another package, adding it to the growing pile. "We've got eleven soldiers leaving this week. I'll have a package for each of them, and I'll press it into their hands personally before they go. Some of them will think it's silly. Some will be touched. But every single one will remember it."

"Everything you need, nothing you don't," Elba repeated softly, looking at the neat rows of completed packages. "But also... everything they need to know someone cared."

"Now you're getting it." Aldwin's smile was warm. "That's the halfling way, lass. Practical care. No grand gestures, no dramatic declarations. Just tea, honey, dried fruit, and the time it took to prepare it. That's how you tell someone they matter."

They continued working until all eleven packages were complete, lined up in a neat row on the table. Aldwin inspected each one with a critical eye, making minor adjustments, ensuring the cords were tied securely and the contents were properly distributed.

"Right then," he said, satisfied. "I'll store these in the cool cupboard until the lads are ready to leave. In the meantime—" He reached into a lower waistcoat pocket and produced two small wrapped candies, handing one to Elba. "—I'd say we've earned a bit of sweetness ourselves. Good work today."

Elba unwrapped the candy, popping it into her mouth. Honey and lemon, exactly what she needed after the afternoon's work. She wasn't even surprised he'd known. "Thank you for teaching me this, Chief."

"Thank you for helping." Aldwin unwrapped his own candy—butterscotch, naturally. "Besides, now when I'm not around, you'll know how it's done. That's how traditions continue, you know. Someone has to pass them on."

As they cleaned up the workspace, Elba found herself watching the way Aldwin returned each item to its proper place—supplies to shelves, waxed paper to the scrap bin, cloth bags to their storage box. Everything exactly where it needed to be. Everything you need, nothing you don't.

It was, she reflected, a pretty good philosophy for more than just waistcoat pockets.

Outside, the sounds of rebuilding continued—hammers striking wood, voices calling instructions, the community coming together to mend what had been broken. And inside, eleven small packages waited to tell eleven wounded soldiers that they mattered, that they were valued, that someone cared enough to send them home with more than just their scars.

## Integration Notes for Chapter 16

**Placement**: Insert this scene as Scene 16-05 or 16-06, during the mid-chapter community support phase
