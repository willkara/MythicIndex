# Magic System (D&D 5e)

## Source of Magic
- **The Weave**: The universal magical field, governed by the goddess Mystra. It is the source of all arcane magic.
- **Divine Power**: Magic granted by deities to their faithful followers (Clerics, Paladins).
- **Nature**: Primal magic drawn from the natural world and its spirits (Druids, Rangers).
- **Pacts**: Power granted by powerful otherworldly patrons in exchange for service (Warlocks).
- **Innate Ability**: Magic that manifests from a creature's bloodline or a cosmic event (Sorcerers).
- **Artifice**: The practice of infusing mundane items with magical power (Artificers).

## Magic Users
- **Wizards**: Scholars who learn to manipulate the Weave through intense study and practice.
- **Sorcerers**: Innate casters who command magic through force of will and natural talent.
- **Clerics**: Conduits of divine power, granted spells by their chosen deity.
- **Druids**: Wielders of primal nature magic, often organized into regional Circles that protect the natural balance. They are masters of shapeshifting and communing with animals.
- **Warlocks**: Bound to powerful patrons (fiends, archfey, great old ones) who grant them magical abilities.
- **Bards**: Weavers of magic through song, story, and performance.
- **Rangers**: Warriors who blend martial prowess with a touch of nature magic for survival and tracking.
- **Paladins**: Holy warriors whose conviction and oath manifest as divine power.
- **Artificers**: Magical inventors who fuse arcane principles with technology.

## Limitations
- **Spell Slots**: A measure of the magical energy a caster can expend per day. More powerful spells require higher-level slots.
- **Components**: Spells may require verbal words (V), somatic gestures (S), and/or material components (M).
- **Concentration**: Many powerful, ongoing spells require the caster to maintain focus. If their concentration is broken, the spell ends.
- **Line of Sight/Effect**: Most spells require the caster to be able to see their target and have an unobstructed path for the magic to travel.
- **Range Limitations**: Spells have defined ranges, from touch to several miles.

## Costs/Consequences
- **Physical/Mental Exhaustion**: Using magic is taxing. Expending all of one's spell slots can lead to exhaustion.
- **Material Components**: Some powerful spells consume rare and expensive material components.
- **Wild Magic Surges**: For some sorcerers, their connection to magic is unstable, leading to unpredictable and often dangerous magical effects.
- **Divine Disfavor**: Clerics and Paladins who act against their deity's tenets may find their magical abilities revoked.
- **Patron's Whims**: Warlocks are subject to the demands and desires of their powerful patrons, which can be capricious and dangerous.
- **Transformation Strain**: Druidic shapeshifting, especially when self-taught or pushed beyond normal limits, can cause severe physical and psychological strain, risking the loss of one's original identity to the beast within.

## Visual Summary
Magic in this world is tangible and often elemental. Arcane spells manifest as crackling energy or intricate, glowing runes. Divine magic appears as golden or silver light, while druidic magic involves natural elements like twisting vines or spectral animals. Unnatural or corrupted magic, such as that used by the Scales of Pyre cult, is often distinguished by a sickly green-white flame and an oily, black smoke.
