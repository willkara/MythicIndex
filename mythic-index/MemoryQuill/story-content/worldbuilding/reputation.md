# Last Light Company - Public & Covert Reputation

## I. Common Folk of Waterdeep & Nearby Settlements

### A. Official Stance & Public Perception
The Last Light Company is widely regarded as a beacon of hope and a symbol of pragmatic compassion. Unlike the City Watch, which enforces laws, or noble houses, which pursue power, the Company is seen as being singularly focused on a mission that benefits everyone: "no one left behind." Their official relationship with the common folk is one of mutual respect, built on a foundation of proven results. They are not an arm of the government; they are a professional, reliable service that anyone can turn to in a crisis.

### B. Popular Rumors & Perceptions (Tavern Talk)

#### Veyra Thornwake
*   "They say Commander Thornwake herself pulls a name from a rescued person's lips and tattoos it on her own skin. A 'record of weight,' they call it. She carries every soul she saves."
*   "They say she survived the Dragon's Breath fire that took her whole company. That the burn on her face is a reminder that she can walk through flames and come out the other side."
*   "I heard a story that she once stared down a whole hobgoblin platoon, not with a sword, but with a look. Didn't even flinch. The hobgoblins were the ones who backed down."

#### Thorne Brightward
*   "Captain Brightward, he still walks the beat in the Lower City sometimes, just to keep a feel for things. He's not too proud to talk to folks, even though he's running that whole operation up on the hill. He's still one of us."
*   "When you hear Captain Brightward's horn, you know help has arrived. It's not just a sound; it's a promise. It means the professionals are here."
*   "He's the rock of that company. Veyra might be the heart, but Thorne is the shield. He's the one who makes sure the plans are solid and everyone comes home."

#### Vera Moonwhisper & Rylan Ashvale
*   "My cousin was lost in the Westwood. The Watch said it was a lost cause. Two days later, the Last Light brought him back. Said a woman with eyes like a storm and a whisper of a tracker found his trail when no one else could."
*   **Vera**: "Vera doesn't just talk to animals, she *listens*. My friend swears he saw her get directions from a squirrel. A squirrel! And she found the missing kid, didn't she?"
*   **Rylan**: "The weather mage? Be careful what you say around him. My neighbor's crops were dying, and he cursed the lack of rain. The next day, a storm flooded his fields. He's powerful, but his magic has a mind of its own."
*   **Rylan**: "He has a pet phoenix. A literal bird made of fire. Some say it's a sign of good luck, others say it's a sign he's meddling with things best left alone."
*   **Vera**: "They say she can see through the eyes of her raven, Echo. That's how she finds people no one else can. She's got eyes in the sky."

#### Brother Aldwin Gentleheart
*   "My little girl had a terrible fever. The local cleric was out of ideas. We went to the Bastion, and Brother Aldwin didn't just give her medicine; he sat with her for hours, brewing some special tea and telling her stories until the fever broke. He's got a kindness you don't see much these days."
*   "That halfling's tea... it's more than just herbs. Had a cup after a bad fall, and it wasn't just the pain that went away. It was the fear, too. It's like drinking a bit of courage."
*   "He was there when the Watch brought in the bodies from that ghoul attack. Didn't flinch. Just calmly went about his work, treating the living and showing respect to the dead. He's seen it all."

#### Grimjaw Ironbeard
*   "Saw Grimjaw Ironbeard in the market yesterday. Bought a round of drinks for some quarry workers and spent an hour showing them a safer way to shore up a support beam. Didn't ask for a copper."
*   "Old man Grimjaw? Saw him lift the back of a collapsed cart like it was a sack of potatoes. The ox was trapped underneath. He just... lifted it. Didn't even break a sweat."
*   "He calls all the young ones in the Company 'kids.' Watched him chew out a noble's son for talking down to the little gnome, Cid. He's like a badger protecting his own."

#### Nireya Voss
*   "Heard they have a 'Death-Walker' up there. Someone who can speak to the dead. Not in a scary way, mind. More like... she makes sure everyone gets to say their piece before they move on."
*   "I saw her in the graveyard at midnight, just... talking to the headstones. Not crazy-like, but like she was having a conversation. Gave me the chills."
*   "She leaves little carved tokens at the site of any tragedy. Says it helps the spirits rest easy. A bit strange, but a kind gesture, I suppose."

#### Korrath Threnx & Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld
*   "Remember that bridge that washed out last spring? The city was going to take months to fix it. Korrath and that little gnome with the metal arm, Cid, they were down there the next day. Had a new, stronger bridge up in a week. They argue like an old married couple, but they work like a well-oiled machine."
*   **Korrath**: "The dragonborn, Korrath? He once spent a whole day inspecting the foundation of the Yawning Portal's signpost. Said it was 'structurally unsound.' The next day, a storm knocked it over, right where he said it would fall. He just nodded."
*   **Cid**: "Cid's always building something strange. Last week, it was a mechanical chicken that laid brass eggs. Don't ask me why. But when the sewers backed up, she built a clockwork crab that cleared the blockage in an hour."
*   **Cid**: "Her metal arm isn't just a prosthetic. I saw it turn into a grappling hook once. And a wrench. And a small crossbow. She's got more tools in that arm than a master smith has in his entire shop."

#### Marcus Heartbridge & Lyra Kestrel
*   "When my brother was snatched by that smuggling ring, the Watch couldn't find a whisper. Then this smooth-talking fellow, Marcus, shows up asking questions. A day later, this quiet tiefling lass, Lyra, just appears with my brother in tow. They said she walked right into the smugglers' den and walked right out with him, no fuss. Like a ghost."
*   **Marcus**: "Marcus could talk a dragon into giving up its hoard. He once settled a week-long dockworker strike with a single speech and three barrels of dwarven ale."
*   **Lyra**: "They call her the 'Kestrel,' but I've heard she's more like a ghost. She once got into the city's most secure vault, left a single black feather on the gold pile, and left without anyone knowing she was there. Just to prove she could."
*   **Marcus**: "He knows everyone. I mean *everyone*. If you need to get a message to a noble, a guild master, or a crime boss, Marcus knows a guy who knows a guy."

#### General Company Rumors
*   **Funding & Ethics**: "Heard they took that job for Lord Silversun, and he paid them a king's ransom. But then I saw them spend a week searching for old man Hemlock's daughter, and he ain't got two coppers to rub together. They brought her back, too. They'll take a rich man's gold, but they won't leave a poor man's family behind."

#### On Members Working Together:

*   **Thorne & Grimjaw (The Veterans):** "Saw Captain Brightward sharing a drink with old Grimjaw by the fire pits one night. Not saying much, just companionable silence. It's like the whole world's troubles were on their shoulders, but as long as they were both there, the rest of us were safe. The old guard and the old rock, watching over the kids."
*   **Veyra & Aldwin (The Weight of Command):** "My wife helps with the laundry from the Bastion. She says sometimes, late at night, she sees the Commander sitting alone in the gardens. And that little halfling healer, Aldwin, he'll come out with two cups of tea, and they'll just sit there. Not a word spoken. It's like he's healing the Commander, too."
*   **Nireya & Vera (The Unseen):** "You know Vera's raven, Echo? Scared of its own shadow, that one. But I saw it perched on the Death-Walker's shoulder the other day, calm as you please. The two of them were just staring out at the hills, like they were watching the same thing none of the rest of us could see."
*   **Cid & Marcus (Unorthodox Solutions):** "Heard Marcus needed to get a message to a paranoid noble who'd locked himself in his manor. The next day, a little clockwork bird flies through the noble's window, drops off the message, and then neatly folds itself into a paperweight on his desk. Had Cid's fingerprints all over it. The noble was so impressed he signed the treaty on the spot."

#### On the Company as a Whole:

*   **Life at the Bastion:** "My brother helped deliver supplies up to the Bastion. He said it's not like a fortress at all. It's... alive. Gardens everywhere, a big open courtyard with a fire always going. He said it felt more like a monastery than a barracks, but a monastery where everyone is a master of their craft."
*   **Their Training:** "Walked by the Bastion the other day and saw them training. It's not just sparring. The big dragonborn, Korrath, was having the little tiefling, Lyra, try to get past a series of traps he'd built. It's like a deadly game to them, but it's how they get so good. They don't practice fighting; they practice *winning*."
*   **Their Arrival:** "When the Last Light shows up, it's not always a big, heroic charge with a horn blast. Sometimes it's just one person. The right person. The tracker, the fixer, the ghost. They don't send an army; they send a solution."
*   **Their Thoroughness:** "They don't just rescue you. They finish the job. When they brought back the miller's son from the goblin caves, they also brought back a map of the entire tunnel system and gave it to the Watch. A week later, no more goblins."
*   **The Hall of Remembrance:** "They have a hall in the Bastion, the Hall of Remembrance. It's not just for their own fallen. They say if they can't bring you back, they'll bring back your name, and you'll have a place of honor in their home forever. They don't forget anyone."
*   **The Found Family:** "They're not just a company; they're a clan. You see them in the market, and they move like a unit. The old dwarf, Grimjaw, is the patriarch, Veyra is the matriarch, and the rest are their very, very dangerous children. They look out for each other, and they look out for us."

### C. Covert Reputation & Street-Level Knowledge

On the streets, it's understood that the Company operates with a level of effectiveness that official channels can't match. They are known for their discretion and their ability to navigate the city's underbelly when necessary.

*   **Discreet Inquiries:** It's an open secret that if you need to find someone who vanished without a trace, you don't go to the Watch—you find a way to get a message to the Last Light. There are certain tavern keepers, street vendors, and even beggars who are known to be "friends of the Light" and can pass a message up the chain for a small fee or a piece of valuable information.
*   **The Unseen Hand:** When a corrupt merchant's kidnapping ring is suddenly and quietly dismantled, or a group of smugglers preying on refugees disappears overnight, people whisper that the Company was involved, even if there's no official record. This is where the "awareness that they hold power" comes in—they are seen as a force that can bring justice where the law cannot or will not reach. They are the city's necessary shadow.
*   **"Acquisitions"**: There's a quiet understanding that the Company is well-funded, and not all of it comes from donations. If a rescued merchant happens to be "missing" a valuable artifact that was originally stolen, or if a corrupt noble's vault is found empty after a "rescue," most common folk just smile and figure it's karma. This hints at Lyra's "acquisitions" and the pragmatic approach to funding. It's seen less as theft and more as a "retrieval fee" from those who can afford it, and who probably deserved it.
*   **The Fear Factor**: While the common folk don't fear the Company, the city's criminal element certainly does. A rumor in the underworld says that if the Last Light is hired to find you, you might as well turn yourself in to the Watch. It's less painful. They are known to be relentless, and their methods, while not cruel, are ruthlessly efficient.

## II. City Watch & Nobility

### A. Official Stance & Public Perception

Officially, the Last Light Company holds the status of "Provisional Civic Asset" as granted by the Lords' Committee for Civic Security. This recognition came after their heroic defense of the Westwall Watchpost and acknowledges them as a specialized team of experts serving the broader community. However, this status is contingent on the Company submitting a formal charter for approval by the summer solstice. Captain Thorne Brightward's history with the City Guard provides a crucial bridge of trust, while Marcus Heartbridge's behind-the-scenes political maneuvering secured their warehouse headquarters and helped navigate the complex bureaucracy. They are seen as partners in maintaining regional safety, though their independence remains a point of ongoing political discussion.

### B. Popular Rumors & Perceptions (Guard Barracks & Noble Courts)

*   "Thorne was one of ours, and he runs a tight ship. The Last Light might bend the rules, but they get results we can't. Better to have them as allies than enemies." (A common sentiment among the City Watch, reflecting respect for Thorne's professionalism.)
*   "They operate in the gray. We handle the black and white of the law. Sometimes, when a case gets too... complicated, a quiet word with the Last Light can resolve things without a messy public trial." (Acknowledges their unofficial role as "fixers" for problems outside the Watch's strict jurisdiction.)
*   "I don't trust them. They're a private army with their own agenda, operating outside the chain of command. Today they're heroes, but what about tomorrow? What happens when their definition of 'the right thing' doesn't align with ours?" (A dissenting voice, likely from a more rigid Watch officer or a paranoid noble, highlighting the potential for conflict.)
*   "They have their uses. When my nephew was taken by those cultists, the Watch was bound by procedure. The Last Light... was not. They were worth every dragon." (A pragmatic view from a noble who has benefited from their less-than-legal methods.)
*   "Veyra Thornwake has the ear of some very powerful people, but she doesn't play the game. She shows up to meetings, states her case, and leaves. It's refreshing, but it unnerves some of the Lords who are used to more... subtlety." (Highlights Veyra's direct, no-nonsense approach in political circles.)

### C. Covert Reputation & Official Understanding

Behind closed doors, the relationship is more complex. The City Watch and certain Lords unofficially "outsource" high-risk or politically sensitive rescue operations to the Company. This provides plausible deniability for the city's leadership. While there are occasional jurisdictional disputes or disagreements over methods (especially when Marcus's bribes or Lyra's infiltration tactics come to light), there is a shared understanding: the Last Light handles the missions the city can't, or won't, touch. This creates a tense but functional symbiosis. Thorne often acts as the official liaison, smoothing over ruffled feathers, while Marcus works in the background, ensuring the right palms are greased and the right favors are called in to maintain this delicate balance. The Company, in turn, sometimes provides the Watch with anonymous tips or evidence that helps them close cases that would otherwise go cold, further cementing their unofficial partnership.
