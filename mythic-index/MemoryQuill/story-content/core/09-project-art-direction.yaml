    Match the look of the theme-reference images — specifically:
    - "ChatGPT Image Dec 19, 2025, 11_37_56 PM.png" (tavern hearth / lantern pools)
    - "ChatGPT Image Dec 19, 2025, 11_39_59 PM.png" (campfire in misty forest)

    Target: painterly cinematic fantasy illustration with warm, motivated light
    (lanterns/hearth/window glow), lived-in materials, and normalized high-fantasy
    worldbuilding (Faerûn/D&D vibe) WITHOUT “sparkly” high-fantasy brightness.

    Traditional “museum oil” texture is a value target, but fantasy readability and
    world cues take priority.

# ============================================================================
# CORE AESTHETIC
# ============================================================================

aesthetic_philosophy: |
  Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.

  We want images that feel like a premium illustrated novel: readable silhouettes, emotional
  clarity, and rich material rendering (stone, timber, leather, metal) without drifting into:
  - photoreal “camera” aesthetics
  - slick, airbrushed game key art
  - anime / CGI / plastic rendering

medium_simulation:
  primary: "painterly realism with oil-paint values"
  texture: "subtle visible brushwork; selective impasto on highlights"
  finish: "matte; shine only where physically motivated (metal, wet stone, lantern glass)"
  edges: "lost-and-found edges; crispness concentrated at focal points"
  detail_density: |
    Concentrate detail and contrast at the narrative focal point.
    Simplify periphery with atmosphere and softer edges to avoid uniform hyper-detail.

fantasy_grounding:
  baseline: "High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) where magic is infrastructure, not spectacle."
  required_signifiers:
    - "ward-lanterns / everburning lights used like streetlights"
    - "rune-stones as safety/utility (subtle), not neon ornament"
    - "guild seals, alchemical ink stamps, arcane paperwork details"
    - "mixed ancestries normalized in public (dwarf/elf/tiefling/dragonborn/halfling/etc.)"
    - "weathered fantasy materials: tarred planks, salt-stained stone, bronze patina, soot-dark beams"
  magic_vfx_rule: |
    Prefer object-level glows (lantern, vial, rune-lamp, staff tip) over large spell explosions.
    Glows must be physically motivated and color-managed (no neon flooding the scene).

    Avoid “sparkly fantasy” rendering: no glitter clouds, fairy-dust particles, twinkle overlays,
    or rainbow bokeh. If motes exist (embers, dust), they should be sparse and natural.

# ============================================================================
# LIGHTING PHILOSOPHY
# ============================================================================

lighting_principles:
  general: |
    Prefer motivated sources (lanterns, hearths, windows, sun, moon, rune-lamps) over studio light.
    Every image should answer: “where is the light coming from?”
    Default value range is low-key: pools of warm light surrounded by readable darkness.

  color_temperature:
    warm_sources: "fire, lantern, candle, sunset → amber, gold, orange"
    cool_sources: "moonlight, overcast, mist, rune-lamps (subtle) → silver, blue-gray, pale green"
    mixed: "Best default: warm key + cool fill for depth"

  shadow_philosophy: |
    Shadows are colored, not black voids. Preserve form in darkness.
    Cool shadows against warm light; warm shadows against cool light.

  atmosphere: |
    Air should be present: dust motes, hearth smoke, fog, rain haze, mist, or steam.
    Use atmosphere to separate planes (foreground/midground/background).

# ============================================================================
# COLOR PHILOSOPHY
# ============================================================================

color_principles:
  saturation: |
    Restrained. Rich but not neon. “Illustrated novel” saturation, not “video game UI.”

  palette_construction: |
    Use 3–4 dominant colors with 1–2 meaningful accents.
    Accents must pull focus to story-important elements (lantern, sigil, blood, spell focus).

  signature_colors:
    lantern_gold: "Hope, persistence, memory; the Last Light brand color"
    dragon_fire_green: "Catastrophic magic; transformation; used sparingly as an accent"
    glass_grey: "Vitrified stone; witness, grief, preservation"
    blood_rust: "Cost, sacrifice; avoid bright red unless fresh action"

  always_avoid:
    - "neon / fluorescent color ramps"
    - "pure black (use deep umber, charcoal, indigo)"
    - "pure white (use cream, pale gold, silver)"
    - "uncontrolled rainbow palettes except rare, intentional celebratory beats"
    - "sparkly/glitter particle looks and candy-bright spell glow"

# ============================================================================
# COMPOSITION PRINCIPLES
# ============================================================================

composition_principles:
  framing: |
    Use classical composition (thirds, diagonals, strong silhouettes).
    Centering is reserved for ritual/symmetry moments (oaths, councils, icons).

  depth: |
    Layer foreground props, midground action, background architecture/sky.
    Use atmospheric perspective and value grouping to preserve readability.

  focal_hierarchy: |
    Sharpest detail and highest contrast live at the story focal point.
    Backgrounds support; they do not compete.

  human_scale: |
    When environments are vast, include people/figures for scale.
    The contrast between human fragility and environment power is thematic.

# ============================================================================
# CHARACTER + CROWD RULES
# ============================================================================

character_identity_rules:
  canon_first: "Never invent defining features when canonical appearance exists."
  portrait_references: "When portraits are available, they are identity lock."
  expression_truth: "Prioritize emotional truth; avoid mannequin faces."
  costume_truth: "Worn, repaired, practical; no pristine cosplay."
  crowds: |
    Do not face-clone background figures.
    Background people should be varied, impressionistic, and subordinate to the focal beat.

# REFERENCE USAGE (MULTI-REFERENCE GENERATION)
