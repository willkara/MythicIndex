# Travel Times & Logistics

This document outlines the standard travel durations between key locations in the realm of Aerthos. These times represent normal travel conditions and should guide narrative pacing unless extraordinary circumstances alter them.

## Standard Travel Expectations

### Regional Travel

**On Foot:** Roughly 24 miles per day through varied terrain, assuming eight hours of steady travel with appropriate rest stops.

**Horseback:** Approximately 45 miles per day on good roads, 35 miles through rough country, limited by the need to care for mounts and find suitable stopping places.

**Carriage:** Around 25 miles per day, restricted to established roadways and slowed by the need for frequent stops to rest draft animals.

**Forced Marches:** Travelers can push beyond normal limits, covering half again the usual distance, but risk exhaustion and must rest longer the following day.

### Urban Travel

**Walking:** 15-30 minutes between districts depending on city size, crowds, and familiarity with shortcuts.

**Mounted (where permitted):** 5-15 minutes between districts, though many cities restrict horses to main thoroughfares.

**Carriage:** 10-20 minutes between districts via main roads, but slower during market hours or festivals.

**City-Specific Factors:**

- **Rush periods** (market days, shift changes): Add 50% to travel time
- **Unfamiliar visitors**: Add 25% due to navigation uncertainty
- **Back alleys and shortcuts**: Reduce time by 25% but may involve risks
- **Guard checkpoints**: Add 5-10 minutes at district boundaries in heavily secured cities

## Travel Modifiers

**Group Composition:**

- Small, experienced groups maintain full travel speed
- Large parties or those with heavily armored members reduce speed by roughly 25%
- Mixed groups travel at the speed of their slowest member

**Terrain Types:**

- **Roads & Paths:** Full travel speed with reliable navigation
- **Open Country:** Normal speed through fields, plains, and light forests
- **Rough Terrain:** Three-quarters normal speed through dense woods, hills, and marshlands
- **Difficult Terrain:** Half normal speed through mountains, deep swamps, or ancient ruins

**Supplies & Navigation:**

- Most parties can carry 5-7 days of provisions for temperate travel
- Desert regions require double water supplies, effectively halving travel range
- Poor weather or unfamiliar territory risks adding 1-2 days from navigation errors
- Night travel proceeds at half normal speed with increased chance of mishaps

**Seasonal Considerations:**

- Winter conditions in northern regions can add 20-50% to travel times
- Spring thaw may render certain mountain passes impassable for weeks
- Storm seasons make sea travel unreliable, potentially doubling journey times
