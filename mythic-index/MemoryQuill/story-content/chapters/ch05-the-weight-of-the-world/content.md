The messenger arrived at dawn—six in the morning by the watch tower bells—his horse lathered with sweat and foam, hooves striking sparks from the Westwall's cobblestones. The boy—barely sixteen—half-fell from his saddle, legs trembling from the desperate ride.

"The Blackvein Lode," he gasped, clutching at Darric who'd rushed to steady him. "Twelve men trapped. They need—" His voice cracked. "My father's down there."

Within minutes, the Westwall Watchpost transformed from morning routine to immediate crisis mobilization. Veyra emerged from the command post already armored, Aldwin's recent addition to their ranks proving immediately vital as he began preparing medical supplies with practiced efficiency.

The Last Light Company's first official contract wasn't supposed to be like this. They'd expected a lost caravan, perhaps bandits, something they could handle with swords and determination. Not this—not the mountain itself as enemy.

The Blackvein Lode sprawled across the foothills of the Sword Mountains like a wound in the earth. By midday they reached the Blackvein Lode, and as they approached, the scene that greeted them was one of barely controlled chaos. Mining families clustered around the main shaft, their faces masks of grief and desperate hope. The morning sun did nothing to warm the chill of disaster that hung over everything like a shroud.

A low rumble echoed from deep within the earth—an aftershock. Several women screamed. Men who'd been preparing to enter the mine backed away, fear naked on their dust-caked faces.

"Where's the foreman?" Veyra's voice cut through the panic, calm and commanding.

A dwarf stumbled forward, his beard gray with rock dust, his eyes hollow. "That'd be me, ma'am. Dolgrim Ironfoot. Twelve of my boys are down there. First collapse happened at dawn—that trapped them, but they still had air flow through cracks in the ceiling. Then this morning, about an hour ago, the Guild showed up with their heavy equipment." His face darkened with anger. "Said they'd have it cleared in minutes. Instead, they triggered a secondary collapse that sealed every crack, every airway. Made it ten times worse." He gestured helplessly at the mine entrance, where timber supports groaned ominously. "Now we can hear 'em sometimes—tapping. They're alive, but the air..."

"How long do they have?" Aldwin asked quietly, already setting up a triage station with Halden's help.

"That deep gallery's bigger than most—might hold three hours of air when it's completely sealed," Dolgrim replied, his voice breaking. "But it's only been sealed tight for an hour. If we're lucky, we've got two hours left. Maybe a bit more if they're staying calm and not panicking."

Veyra established her command post at the mine head, a simple table but positioned where everyone could see her—a fixed point of authority in the chaos. "Thorne, take an assessment team. Don't go deep, just evaluate. Aldwin, prepare for injured—crush wounds, possibly worse. Everyone else, I need a perimeter. Keep the families back but close enough to see we're working."

"Commander," Dolgrim interrupted, wringing his hands. "The Guild already sent their best. Made it worse, they did. Triggered a secondary collapse. Said it's a lost cause now. Only name they mentioned was..." He swallowed hard. "Grimjaw Ironbeard. Said he was the only one who ever kept a perfect safety record in the deep mines. But he's been retired for years. Won't take contracts."

Thorne returned from his initial assessment, his armor now coated in a fine layer of dust that seemed to absorb light. His expression was grim as granite. "It's bad, Veyra. I can hear them—faint tapping from deep down. But the tunnel's not just collapsed, it's shifted. The mountain's still moving. Every time someone goes in, more comes down."

"Then we need someone who speaks the mountain's language," Veyra said, her scarred fingers drumming once on the table before stilling. "Thorne, take Darric and Fayne. Find Grimjaw Ironbeard."

"He could be anywhere in the Sword Mountains," Fayne pointed out, their usually calm voice tight with urgency.

"Then you'd better hurry," Veyra replied. "Two hours isn't much time to find a hermit dwarf in the entire Sword Mountains, but it's what we have."

By afternoon, with the rescue efforts stalled and time running out, the search party set out for the mountains. The party consisted of Thorne leading, Darric for his strength and steadiness, and Fayne whose sharp eye for detail had saved them more than once. Dolgrim had provided what little he knew—"a cabin somewhere on the western slope, past the old Stonehammer quarry. Dwarf keeps to himself. You'll know you're close when you see the warnings."

The trail to find Grimjaw was itself a test. What had once been a proper mining road had been deliberately allowed to decay. Bridges that should have been maintained were missing key planks. Trail markers had been turned to point in wrong directions or removed entirely. It was a path designed to discourage visitors, and it was working.

"This isn't neglect," Fayne observed, studying a carefully positioned rockfall that blocked what would have been the easiest route. "This is craftsmanship. He's made the mountain itself unwelcoming."

"Perfect," Darric grumbled, pulling his boot from a patch of mud that seemed strategically placed to catch the unwary. "We're trying to save lives and he's playing games."

"No," Thorne corrected, studying the obstacle course of a trail with growing respect. "He's testing. Only someone truly desperate or truly determined would make it through this."

They climbed higher, the morning sun now approaching noon, time bleeding away with every difficult step. The forest grew denser, older, the trees massive patriarchs that had watched centuries pass. And then Fayne spotted it—a stone marker almost invisible beneath the moss, carved with dwarven runes.

"What's it say?" Darric asked.

Fayne squinted, their knowledge of Dwarvish limited but sufficient. "Roughly translated? 'Bugger off, the lot of you.'"

"Friendly," Darric snorted.

"Perfect," Thorne said, a grim smile crossing his face. "He's exactly what we need—someone who doesn't want to be needed."

They pressed on, following more markers, each more creatively insulting than the last. The trail grew treacherous—not dangerous enough to kill, but certainly enough to make the average visitor reconsider. It was a masterwork of discouragement.

Then they heard it: the rhythmic ring of metal on stone, steady as a heartbeat, patient as time itself.

They found Grimjaw Ironbeard not in a cozy retirement cottage as expected, but halfway up a sheer cliff face, single-handedly shoring up a massive overhang that loomed over a shepherd's path below. He worked without safety lines, without assistants, just a dwarf and his tools against thousands of tons of waiting stone.

He was exactly as the legends described—broad as a door, arms like tree trunks, a beard the color of iron streaked with silver, braided with chips of various stones like a geological record of his career. His movements were economical, precise, each hammer blow placed with the certainty of decades of experience. He didn't rush despite the obvious danger. The mountain had waited eons; it could wait for him to work properly.

"I said bugger off," Grimjaw growled without turning, his voice like grinding millstones. "Signs were clear enough, weren't they?"

"Men are trapped," Thorne said simply, knowing elaborate persuasion would be wasted on this one.

"Not my problem," Grimjaw retorted, driving a timber support into place with one massive blow. The crack echoed off the mountainside. "Retired means retired."

"Children will lose fathers," Thorne tried again, taking a different angle.

Grimjaw paused for just a moment, his hammer hesitating at the apex of its arc. Then he brought it down with particular force. "Still not my problem. World's full of orphans. Always has been."

"The mountain's winning," Fayne said suddenly, their voice cutting through the standoff with unexpected sharpness.

Grimjaw's hammer stopped mid-swing. Slowly, deliberately, he turned to look at them. His eyes were the color of deep stone, older than his years, holding the weight of mountains. "What did you say?"

"The mountain," Fayne repeated, meeting that ancient gaze steadily. "It's beating them. The Blackvein Lode. They can't figure out how to shore it up. Collapse in the deep gallery. Guild engineers already failed, made it worse. Twelve men dying in the dark while the mountain laughs at human arrogance."

"Guild engineers," Grimjaw spat the words like a curse. "Idiots probably using pine bracers in a shifting gallery. Don't know the difference between compression and tension, between what the stone's saying and and what they want to hear."

"Then come show them how it's done," Thorne said, recognizing the opening.

"I'm retired," Grimjaw stated again, but something in his voice had changed—less certainty, more habit.

"So was I," a new voice said from behind them. They turned to see Veyra climbing the last stretch of path, having followed them rather than wait. Her scarred face was calm, but her eyes held urgency. "I was done with the world. Done with trying. Then people needed help, and I remembered that retirement is a luxury the dying don't have."

Grimjaw studied her, his gaze lingering on her scars, reading the story they told. "You're the Ash-Marked. The one who walked out of Undershade Canyon when a hundred didn't."

"I'm someone who knows what it's like to be trapped in the dark," she replied steadily. "Waiting for help that might not come. Listening to the mountain decide whether you live or die."

"And you got out," he said, his voice a low rumble of assessment.

"With help," she corrected. "Someone who knew the stone's language. Someone who could read the mountain's mood. Like you can."

Grimjaw looked from her scarred determination to Thorne's steady presence to Fayne's unexpected wisdom. Then he looked at the cliff face he'd been shoring up—saving a handful of shepherds who might use this path from a death they'd never know threatened them.

"You think you're building something," he said, not quite a question.

"I know we are," Veyra replied. "Something for people who've been written off as lost causes."

The silence stretched, filled only by the wind through stone and the distant cry of a mountain eagle. Grimjaw set down his hammer with the careful precision of someone who knew exactly how much force even a gentle placement could carry.

"The mountain always wins in the end," he said finally, his voice carrying the weight of absolute truth. "The trick is knowing when to stop fighting and start listening." He gathered his tools with practiced efficiency, each movement deliberate. "Fine. I'll come. But we do this my way, or those men die badly instead of maybe living. And when it's done, you're buying the ale. The good stuff, not that swill they serve in Waterdeep taverns."

"Deal," Veyra said immediately.

"And another thing," Grimjaw added, hefting his pack—which looked heavy enough to contain half a mountain itself. "I work alone or with people who listen. No heroes, no glory-seekers. The mountain doesn't care about your courage. It only respects competence."

"Understood," Thorne said.

Grimjaw nodded once, then started down the path at a pace that had them jogging to keep up despite his shorter legs. "Tell me about the collapse. Every detail. The stone type, the support structure, the sounds it made before it went. Everything matters."

As they descended, Fayne provided a detailed account, their memory precise. Grimjaw listened without interrupting, occasionally grunting or muttering something in Dwarvish that sounded distinctly unflattering about the Guild engineers.

They arrived at the Blackvein Lode as the afternoon sun cast long shadows across the mining camp. The situation had deteriorated. The tapping from below had grown fainter, more desperate. Several women were weeping openly. A priest of Kelemvor had arrived and was offering last rites to the empty air.

Grimjaw surveyed the scene with one sweep of his ancient eyes, then spat. "Priest can bugger off. Those men aren't dead yet." His voice carried across the camp, and something in its absolute certainty made people step back, hope kindling in their faces.

He approached the mine entrance like a doctor approaching a patient, circling it, studying the timber supports, the angle of the stones, the way dust fell from the ceiling. He placed one massive hand against the rock face and stood perfectly still for a long moment.

"She's angry," he announced. "You've been poking at her wrong. Making it worse." He turned to the assembled miners. "You, you, and you—" he pointed at three of the burliest, "—you're with me. The rest of you, get back. Far back. The mountain's going to complain before she cooperates."

"What do you need?" Veyra asked.

"Silence when I'm listening. Steady hands when I'm not. And luck—though we make our own down there." He pulled on a helmet that looked like it had seen a thousand descents, lit a lamp that burned with steady flame despite the breeze. As he prepared to descend, he studied the stone patterns around the entrance one more time. "Good news," he announced. "This type of formation usually has natural air pockets. If those boys found one, they might have bought themselves extra time. We'll know soon enough." He turned back to the group. "Someone to keep time. Every five minutes, I want to know. After twenty, we're either coming up with them or not coming up at all."

Thorne stepped forward. "I'll keep time."

"And I'll go down," Darric volunteered.

"No," Grimjaw said flatly. "You're brave and strong and exactly what I don't need. Brave men die in mines. I need men who are scared enough to listen." He pointed at one of the miners, a thin man who looked terrified. "You. You're properly frightened. You'll do exactly as I say."

He entered the mine like he was entering a cathedral, with respect and attention. They could hear his voice echoing back, not shouting but speaking in normal tones, knowing the stone would carry his words.

"Right then, lady. Let's discuss this properly. You've got something of ours, and we'd like them back. In exchange, I'll fix what these idiots broke and maybe convince them to be more respectful in future."

A timber creaked. Dust sifted down.

"That's better. Now, let's see what you're really saying..."

For the next hour, Grimjaw worked with a patience that seemed inhuman given the urgency. He didn't attack the collapse—he conversed with it. Each timber he placed, each stone he shifted, was part of a dialogue none of them could fully understand.

"Five minutes," Thorne called.

"See this stress fracture?" Grimjaw asked the miner with him, pointing to what looked like solid stone. "Mountain's talking. She's saying the weight's wrong here. The Guild boys, they tried to force through. But you don't force stone. You redirect it. Convince it that falling your way is what it wanted all along."

He directed the rescue with gruff precision, teaching them to read the stone's moods, to place supports not where they thought they should go but where the mountain would accept them. It was engineering elevated to art, or perhaps philosophy.

"Ten minutes."

A rumble from deep below. Everyone froze.

"Easy!" Grimjaw bellowed, his voice carrying absolute authority. "Nobody moves until I say. Mountain's thinking about it."

"Fifteen minutes."

And then—a voice from below, faint but clear: "Light! I see light!"

"Don't rush!" Grimjaw roared before anyone could move. "Mountain's still deciding. You come up slow and respectful-like, or she'll take you at the last second out of spite."

One by one, the trapped miners emerged. Some crawled, some were carried, all were coated in dust so thick they looked like ghosts of themselves. Aldwin and Halden moved among them with quiet efficiency, treating crushed limbs and breathing problems, providing water and comfort.

The last man up was the foreman of the trapped crew, carried between two others. His leg was clearly broken, bone showing through torn flesh, but he was alive. As they brought him into daylight, he looked at Grimjaw with eyes that held wonder and confusion in equal measure.

"You... you're that dwarf," he whispered, voice hoarse from dust and dehydration. "Grimjaw Ironbeard. The one who listened to the Mithral Deep before it fell. The one who saved the Goldbeard clan."

"Was," Grimjaw replied gruffly, already turning away. "That dwarf's retired."

"You saved us," the man insisted.

"Mountain let you go," Grimjaw corrected, but his voice was softer than before. "I just asked nicely. Speaking of which—" He turned to glare at the assembled miners. "You've been taking from her for years without proper respect. You want to keep mining here, you learn to listen. Stone talks before it falls. Always. You just have to know the language."

Veyra approached him as the chaos of reunion swirled around them—families embracing, tears of relief, Aldwin moving between the injured with his gentle presence. She held out a heavy purse of coin. "Your payment, Master Ironbeard."

He waved it away without even looking. "Keep it. Buy better timber for the next rescue. These idiots were using green wood in a wet mine. Lucky the mountain only took twelve instead of the whole shift."

He turned to leave, his work done, already retreating into the isolation he'd built so carefully.

"This," Veyra said, her voice stopping him mid-step. "What you did here. This is what we do. This is what the Last Light Company is about. We have the heart—" she gestured to Aldwin tending the wounded, "—we have the will—" a nod to Thorne organizing the evacuation of the injured, "—but we need the foundation. We need someone to teach us how to move the world without breaking it."

Grimjaw turned back, his stone-deep eyes moving across the scene. These rescued miners would go home to their families tonight because of what had been done here. But more than that, they'd learned something. The young miner who'd gone down with him was already explaining to others what Grimjaw had shown him about reading stone.

"You're not just saving them," Grimjaw observed. "You're teaching them to save themselves."

"When we can," Veyra agreed. "But first, we have to reach them. And for that, we need someone who knows that strength isn't about forcing your will on the world, but about understanding what the world is trying to tell you."

Grimjaw looked at Aldwin, who was now brewing tea for a miner's wife who'd collapsed from relief and exhaustion. The halfling's gentle presence had turned a crowd of panic into something approaching peace. He looked at the scarred commander who'd climbed a mountain to find him, who understood that retirement was sometimes a luxury the world couldn't afford.

"My clan's gone," he said suddenly, the words seemingly pulled from deep within. "Cave-in, decades ago. I was the only one who heard the mountain's warning, the only one who got out. Been listening to stone ever since, trying to understand what I missed, why I couldn't save them."

"Maybe," Veyra said gently, "you were saved to save others. Maybe this is your clan now—not of blood, but of purpose."

Grimjaw was quiet for a long moment, watching the sun set behind the Sword Mountains, painting them the color of blood and gold. Somewhere in those peaks was his empty cabin, his self-imposed exile, his retirement from a world that kept needing what he knew.

"The good ale," he said finally. "Not that horse piss they usually serve. And I'll need a proper workshop. Can't teach stone-speaking without the right tools."

"Done," Veyra said immediately.

"And another thing," Grimjaw added, a hint of something that might have been humor in his voice. "That healer of yours—Aldwin. He always make tea at times like this?"

"Always," Thorne confirmed.

"Good. I hate tea, but I respect a man with rituals. Rituals matter. They're how we tell the universe we're paying attention."

He looked at Aldwin, who had finished with the injured and was now preparing a different brew, something that smelled of mint and deep earth. "Oi, Shortbeard!" he called out, using the dwarven term of mild affection for halflings. "Any chance you've got something stronger than leaf water in that kit of yours?"

Aldwin looked up, that rare mischievous glint appearing in his kind eyes. He reached into a different pouch and produced a small, unmarked ceramic bottle, offering it to the dwarf with a slight bow.

Grimjaw uncorked it, sniffed, and his bushy eyebrows shot up. "That's... that's Undermountain Reserve. That's impossible to get."

"Impossible is a word people use when they lack the right friends," Aldwin replied mildly.

Grimjaw took a swig, his eyes widening with appreciation. Then he laughed—a sound like boulders tumbling down a mountain, rough and unstoppable. "All right then. You've got yourself an engineer. But I'm keeping this bottle."

"I have others," Aldwin said with a small smile.

As they prepared to leave, organizing transport for the injured, Grimjaw stood at the mine entrance one last time. He placed his hand against the stone and murmured something in Dwarvish—a promise, perhaps, or an apology for the disrespect the mountain had endured.

The stone was silent, but something in its stillness seemed like acceptance.

The Last Light Company had found its foundation. Now they could truly begin to build.
