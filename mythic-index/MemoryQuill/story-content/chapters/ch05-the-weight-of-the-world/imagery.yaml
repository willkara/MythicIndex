      Veyra Thornwake stands behind a rough-hewn wooden table positioned at the mine head. Her scarred face is composed, unreadable. Behind her, the dark mouth of the mine exhales dust. Mining families cluster in the middle distance. Aldwin sets up triage; Thorne prepares assessment. The scene captures the terrible stillness of command.

      Veyra at lower rule-of-thirds intersection. Mine entrance behind her forms dark focal void. Figures arranged in receding depth. Diagonal lines of timber supports.

      A teenage boy half-falling from a lathered horse at the gates of Westwall Watchpost. It is dawn—blue light mixed with the first gold rays. Darric is rushing to catch him. The horse is exhausted, foam on its flanks. Sparks fly from hooves on cobblestones.

      A moss-covered stone marker on a mountain trail. Dwarven runes carved into it are blunt and deep. Fayne is squatting to read it, looking back at Darric and Thorne with a wry expression. The trail beyond is deliberately overgrown and blocked by a "careful" rockfall. The forest is dense and ancient.
    composition_notes: |
      Medium shot. Stone marker in foreground. Fayne reading it. Trail winding back into depth.

      A single dwarf silhouetted against sky and stone, halfway up a sheer cliff face, holds a massive timber brace against thousands of tons of overhanging rock. He works without safety lines. His hammer is raised at the apex of its swing. Below him, the cliff drops away to a narrow path where tiny figures look upward. Afternoon sun backlights the scene.

    visual_description: |
      Grimjaw's massive, battered hands releasing the handle of his sledgehammer with impossible gentleness, placing it down onto gray mountain stone. His calloused palms and scarred knuckles tell the story of decades. The hammer rests on the rock. Late afternoon golden light catches the iron. At the edge of the frame, Veyra Thornwake is visible—a presence rather than a focus.

      Tight focus on hands and hammer. Grimjaw's profile visible at top edge. Hammer horizontal anchor. Centered composition.

      Grimjaw's calloused palm pressed flat against the rough stone of the mine face, fingers splayed like roots. His profile is shown in deep concentration, eyes closed, listening.
