          Deliberately neglected mining road turned obstacle course. Dense old-growth forest
          with massive ancient trees. Bridges missing key planks, trail markers turned wrong

          visible in background. High noon sun creating dramatic shadows on stone face.
          Thousands of tons of waiting stone. Economical, precise work in progress. Sound

          dust-white ghosts crawling and carried. Contrast of dark mine interior and bright
          exterior. Atmospheric dust motes. Lamplight gold from within. Sound of creaking timber,

      Wide ultra-cinematic view looking up at a massive sheer cliff face of slate-gray stone.
      Halfway up the wall, a stocky dwarf figure works beneath a threatening overhang—a mass
      of stone jutting out at a precarious angle. Grimjaw Ironbeard, small against the immense
      scale but clearly visible, drives timber supports into place with his war-hammer. His
      iron-gray beard braided with metal charms catches the high noon light. He wears reinforced
      leather mining gear, dark and practical, with a wide belt of tools. No safety lines, no
      ropes—just dwarf and tools against gravity. Far below, a thin shepherd's path winds through
      green scrub, emphasizing the deadly height. The mountain peaks rise blue-gray in the
      background. The overhang's shadow creates dramatic contrast.
    composition_notes: |
      Ultra-wide 21:9 format emphasizes the massive horizontal sweep of the cliff. Grimjaw
      positioned in the left third, with the overhang's threatening bulk dominating the upper

      Medium shot of Grimjaw Ironbeard on the cliff face, framed from the waist up. His stocky
      build fills the frame with solid presence. Weathered face with bright keen eyes focused
      on his work, iron-gray beard braided with small metal charms and tiny tool pieces catching
      light. Massive weathered hands grip his war-hammer "Tremor"—a hybrid war-hammer/mining
      pick with masterwork craftsmanship visible in the metalwork. He's driving a timber support
      into the cliff face with economical precision. Reinforced leather mining clothes with metal
      studs, thick worn straps, wide belt with various pouches and loops. Behind him, the massive
      stone overhang looms, thousands of tons suspended. The cliff face shows stress lines and
      geological texture. His stance is solid, feet planted firmly on the narrow ledge.

      shoulder. Blue swirling tattoos on neck. Dark weathered leather armor, heavy cowl,
      reinforced shoulder pauldrons, subtle warm orange glow from lantern at belt. Eyes intense
      and unwavering. Facing stocky dwarf with weathered face, iron-gray beard braided with
      metal charms, bright keen eyes assessing. Dark reinforced leather mining gear, hammer
      at rest. Both bearing marks of survival—fire scars and decades underground. Recognition
      passing between them. Massive stone overhang looming above, mountain backdrop behind.
      16:9 medium two-shot, figures positioned left and right creating central connection.
      Eyes meeting at rule of thirds intersection. High noon sun from above creating harsh
      revealing light, strong shadows on scarred features making texture visible. Clear mountain
      air with subtle heat shimmer. Warm brown and cool stone gray palette with blue tattoo
      and burn scar accents. Mutual respect and understanding visible. Cliff face frames encounter.
      Subtle fantasy: battle-tested commander meets mountain master, scars as badges of survival.

      Close shot focusing on Veyra's scarred face as she speaks, with Grimjaw listening in
      profile. Her burn scar is prominently visible—mottled texture running from jawline up
      left side of her face to temple, the healed skin telling its own story. Her dark eyes
      hold both pain and resolve. The feathered braid falls across one shoulder, blue tattoo
      swirls visible on her neck. Behind her, blurred but present, Grimjaw's weathered profile
      shows him truly listening—not just hearing but reading the weight in her words. His
      stone-deep eyes hold recognition. The cliff face stretches behind them, out of focus.
      Mountain wind stirs the feather in her braid. The moment captures vulnerability made
      into strength.

      and iron banding, groaning timber supports visible within creating geometric patterns.
      Dust falls from the ceiling in lazy columns catching the light. In the mid-ground,
      Grimjaw Ironbeard stands with his massive weathered hand flat against the rock face
      beside the entrance, eyes closed, body perfectly still. His stocky form creates a
      striking silhouette against the lighter stone. Behind him, a crowd of mining families
      watches in hushed silence—men, women, faces marked by dust and worry, held back by
      rope stanchions. The families are blurred but their attention on the dwarf is palpable.
      Mine equipment scattered around—rope, lanterns hanging on posts, tool racks. The
      Sword Mountains rise blue-gray in the distant background. Afternoon sun creates long
      shadows. The entire scene holds its breath as the dwarf listens to thousands of tons
      of angry stone.

      with small metal charms braided in—chips of ore, tiny worn tools catching subtle light.
      Weathered face carved by decades underground, deep lines speaking of experience. His
      lips move slightly—murmuring something, perhaps feeling the stone's answer. The stone
      itself shows texture—metamorphic grain, stress lines, the argent glint of silver-bearing

      Ultra-wide view of mine entrance as miners emerge from the dark maw into daylight.
      The entrance is a black void ringed in stone and timber, groaning supports visible
      within. From this darkness, dust-white figures emerge one by one—some crawling on
      hands and knees, some carried by others, all absolutely coated in dust so thick they
      appear ghostly. The dust catches the daylight creating halos around each figure,
      transforming them into apparitions. In the foreground right, Grimjaw stands watching,
      covered in his own layer of mine dust, war-hammer resting. Left foreground, Aldwin
      and Medic Halden rush forward to help, medical gear ready. The middle ground shows
      the emergence: three miners visible—one crawling, one being supported between two
      others, faces barely distinguishable beneath the dust coating. Behind them, more
      figures visible in the darkness waiting their turn. The contrast between the pitch-black
      mine interior and the bright daylight exterior creates stark drama. Dust motes fill
      the air catching sun rays. Mining families visible in distant background, held at
      rope lines, hands raised to mouths in shock and relief.

      Medium shot at the mine head staging area as sunset paints the mountains blood-gold.
      Aldwin stands offering a small unmarked ceramic bottle to Grimjaw. Aldwin is gentle-
      featured, practical healer's clothes, warm expression of offering. Grimjaw, still
      covered in dust and grime from the rescue, reaches for the bottle—his bushy eyebrows
      raised high in genuine surprise, eyes wide. His weathered face shows the moment before
      laughter breaks, mouth beginning to open. The bottle catches the warm sunset glow,
      amber ceramic suggesting the spirits within. Behind them, the mine head with its
      timber headframe silhouetted against the golden sunset. Other company members visible
      in soft focus background—relieved faces, exhausted but triumphant. Dust still hangs
      in the air catching the golden light. Grimjaw's iron-gray beard is dust-white, tools
      still at his belt. The moment captures unexpected connection—rare gift recognized
      and appreciated.

      16:9 medium two-shot. Aldwin positioned slightly left offering bottle, Grimjaw right
      receiving with surprised delight. Bottle at center as focal point catching sunset glow.
      Background mine headframe silhouetted provides context. Rule of thirds: faces at upper
      intersection points, bottle at center lower third. Warm sunset light from behind creates
      glow around figures. Shallow depth keeping focus on exchange while showing setting.

      Medium shot on the cliff face of Grimjaw turning to look at Fayne. His war-hammer
      "Tremor" is frozen mid-arc at the apex of its swing, the masterwork tool suspended
      in air showing the precise instant of interruption. Grimjaw's body is turned from his
      work, stone-deep eyes—bright and keen despite age—fixing on Fayne with assessment.
      His weathered face shows the transition from automatic refusal to genuine attention.
      Iron-gray beard braided with metal charms, reinforced leather mining gear, stocky
      build planted solid even while turning. In the background slightly blurred but clear:
      Fayne standing with calm steady presence, having just spoken the words "The mountain's
      winning." The cliff face and massive overhang loom above, the work site scattered
      with timbers and tools. Noon sun creates strong side-lighting emphasizing the frozen
      moment.

      frozen at apex creating strong diagonal line. Eyes as focal point, locking with Fayne.
      Fayne positioned left background creating sight line. Suspended hammer creates tension—
      movement stopped mid-action. Cliff and overhang visible behind establishing context.
