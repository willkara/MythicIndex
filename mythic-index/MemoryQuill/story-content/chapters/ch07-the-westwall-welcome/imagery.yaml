      The main hall of the Westwall Watchpost, evening. A long scarred table fills the
      center of the frame, surrounded by mismatched benches and gathered figures.
      Fayne stands mid-speech, notebook forgotten in hand, mouth forming the words
      "Last Light Company." At the center of the table, a battered metal lantern—the
      canyon lantern—burns with flame that is visibly brighter and steadier than it
      was moments before. Warm amber light spills across every face: Veyra with her
      scarred face and dark mohawk, eyes bright with recognition; Thorne with his
      steel-gray hair and military posture, nodding slowly; Grimjaw's craggy features
      softened by the moment; Tomaq's massive gray form, one tusk silver-capped,
      nodding acknowledgment. Tapestries cover the stone walls. The silence of
      recognition is visible in held breath and stillness.
    composition_notes: |
      Ultra-wide hero framing to capture the ensemble. Fayne at left third, speaking.
      Lantern at exact center, the brightest point. Faces arranged around table in

      looking slightly up to give the moment weight. Shallow depth of field on
      background tapestries.

      the amber glow, her dark mohawk with feathered braids silhouetted against the
      light. Her teal tattoos are visible on her raised arm. Around her, faces
      are upturned toward the light—every member of the company touched by the
      radiance. The lantern's flame is steady and bright, casting long shadows
      that reach the tapestried walls. This is the commander as beacon-bearer,
      the mission made visible.

      Medieval great hall at night, tapestried stone walls reaching into shadow.
      Half-elf woman standing at table head with arm raised high, holding a
      battered metal lantern aloft—burn scars on left face catching amber light,
      dark mohawk with feathered braids silhouetted against the glow, teal tattoos
      visible on raised arm, expression of calm purpose.
      Light radiating outward to touch upturned faces below, dust motes catching
      rays, long shadows reaching to walls.
      Ultra-wide cinematic framing, lantern at highest point, commander as
      beacon-bearer, mission made visible.
      Warm amber palette with dramatic shadows, intimate sacred atmosphere.
