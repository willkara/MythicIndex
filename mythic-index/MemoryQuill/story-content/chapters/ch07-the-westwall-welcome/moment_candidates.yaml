      - "Veyra touched the lantern on her desk—not the original, that stayed in the hall, but a smaller version, travel-sized but no less meaningful"
    
    selection_rationale: "The private counterweight to the public scenes. Shows Veyra's methodical nature and the literal mapping of lives in her care. The green pins representing earned hope bring the chapter's transformation theme to a quiet, personal close"
