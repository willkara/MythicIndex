I see Grimjaw's keen engineering perspective revealing the Watchpost's transformation. His expert eye captures the subtle details of renewal - stone repurposed, spaces reimagined, potential emerging from previous ruins. The scene demonstrates how a skilled craftsman reads a space, seeing not just what is, but what could be.

The establishing shot scores high on emotional and visual impact. Fresh paint, personal touches like laundry lines and herb racks transform a military structure into a living community. Each small detail signals belonging and pride, turning a harsh watchpost into a warm home. The scene pivots to show the Company's core values: resilience, adaptation, and community building.

Total score reflects the rich narrative potential of this moment - a military space becoming something deeply personal and alive.

The dwarven encounter crackles with immediate tension that dissolves into camaraderie. Their confrontation reveals character through subtle physical language - matching stares, contrasting attire, an unspoken understanding of mutual respect. The scene captures the complex social dynamics of their world.

Sarge's entrance promises a powerful character introduction, with visual drama emphasized by his massive frame barely fitting through the doorway. His presence suggests weight, both physical and narrative.

The turnip moment provides unexpected comic relief, revealing Elba and Grimjaw's relationship through an absurd shared moment. Their interaction suggests deeper emotional connections beyond surface interactions.

Grimjaw's loft scene represents a profound turning point - finding potential in a space after years of displacement. Arranging tools symbolizes rebuilding, with each placement representing hope and intentional reconstruction of identity. The scene captures vulnerability and quiet determination, transforming a simple physical space into a metaphorical landscape of personal restoration.

The gathering's naming moment - "The Last Light Company" - feels like a ritualistic commitment, with Veyra's lantern gesture embodying collective resilience. Her statement about keeping the light burning transcends literal illumination, suggesting spiritual and emotional perseverance against overwhelming darkness.

The scoring reveals these moments as pivotal: Grimjaw's scene scoring 19 highlights personal transformation, while the naming assembly scores 23, marking a critical narrative shift. Each moment pulses with symbolic weight - tools representing purpose, a lantern symbolizing hope, faces illuminated by shared resolve.

Veyra's scene crystallizes her purpose through a powerful 22-point character moment. Her leadership emerges through light as a metaphorical beacon for the broken, embodying resilience and collective healing.

Scene 07-04 explores potential narrative threads: a drinking contest, storytelling, wall walk reflections, and communal singing. These beats suggest deepening camaraderie and individual character nuances through shared experiences.

The drinking contest, while humorous, lacks narrative significance. Its modest 11-point score indicates more of a character bonding moment than a transformative scene.

The wall walk conversation proves more compelling. With a 19-point score, it reveals Veyra and Thorne's partnership through quiet intimacy. Their silhouetted figures against city lights symbolize reflection and shared journey, creating a visually distinctive moment of connection.

The dwarven mining song emerges as the scene's emotional pinnacle. Scoring 21 points, it transforms potential discord into profound unity. Grimjaw's singing transcends linguistic barriers, creating harmony that speaks to deeper themes of belonging and mutual understanding.

Scene 07-05 explores potential narrative beats through character interactions. Grimjaw examining the tower with Finn, Aldwin organizing the infirmary, and Veyra studying her map each offer unique perspectives on the emerging story.

Veyra's map scene stands out with its 21-point score. The colored pins represent lives and potential, with green symbolizing hope. Her methodical approach reveals her character's depth - how she thinks, plans, and processes grief through careful organization.

The bell's first call marks a pivotal moment of validation. Scoring 18 points, it represents transformation from anonymity to purpose, where being named means being truly seen and needed.

The hero moment remains the watchpost's initial transformation, capturing the subtle details that breathe life into the emerging narrative.

Coverage requirements suggest selecting moments that showcase character diversity, location variation, and narrative progression. The goal is to capture 5-6 key scenes that illuminate the story's emotional and strategic landscape.

I'll refine the selection to balance character focus and scene dynamics. The current lineup provides a compelling narrative arc across different locations, featuring multiple characters and highlighting pivotal interactions.

The selection emphasizes Veyra's journey, with moments revealing her strategic thinking and leadership. Grimjaw's presence adds depth through the dwarven interactions, creating a rich ensemble narrative. By spanning multiple scenes and locations, the chosen moments create a comprehensive snapshot of the group's formation and initial challenges.

The final selection offers a nuanced exploration of the team's early dynamics, capturing transformative moments that define their collective identity and individual strengths. I'm tracking scene distribution carefully. Two moments from scn-07-02 is acceptable, but I need strategic variety. Dwarven Standoff offers strong visual distinctiveness, while Sarge's Entrance provides character dynamic. Both scenes contribute unique narrative texture to the sequence.

I'll need another moment from a different scene to balance the selection. The Naming Assembly or Veyra Raises Lantern from scn-07-03 could provide the necessary scene diversity. Their distinct framing - group versus intimate - makes them compelling candidates.

Visual distinctiveness and character arc remain my primary selection criteria. Each moment must advance narrative understanding while maintaining scene-to-scene momentum.

Character data verification confirms all key figures have published status with established imagery profiles. Sarge's image inventory needs attention, but publication status remains intact.

Seven total moments provides comprehensive scene coverage without overwhelming narrative complexity. The selection maintains thematic coherence and visual progression.
