The final leg of the two-day journey back to Waterdeep tested different muscles than the rescue had—the weight of success mixed with exhaustion, the strange lightness that came after crisis resolved into calm. Grimjaw, despite his shorter stature, set a pace that had the others working to keep up. His three massive packs, which would have broken most men's backs, seemed to barely slow him.

"Master Ironbeard," Darric panted, sweat beading despite the cool morning air, "are you carrying an entire forge on your back?"

"Just the essentials, lad," Grimjaw rumbled, not even breathing heavily. His stride never wavered, each step placed with the same deliberate precision he'd shown in the mine. "A hammer's no good without an anvil. An anvil's no good without proper tools to maintain it. Tools are no good without the means to repair them. Never know when you'll need to rebuild civilization from scratch."

"That's... surprisingly apocalyptic," Venn observed.

"Not apocalyptic," Grimjaw corrected. "Practical. Civilization falls apart regular as clockwork. Sometimes in big ways, sometimes small. The prepared survive. The unprepared become cautionary tales."

As they crested the final hill before Waterdeep's walls, the familiar sight of the Westwall Watchpost came into view, and Veyra found herself seeing it through new eyes—or perhaps through Grimjaw's eyes. The morning sun caught the stone differently, highlighting every worn edge, every makeshift repair.

It had been a simple, functional outpost when the City Watch had abandoned it—four squat towers connected by walls, a central courtyard, basic barracks and storage. But in the weeks since the Last Light Company had claimed it, transformation had begun. What had been a collection of stark military buildings was becoming something else, something more.

Smoke curled from three chimneys now instead of one—the main hall, the converted kitchen, and what Aldwin had claimed as an infirmary. The rhythmic clang of hammer on steel echoed from the small smithy Thorne had established in the eastern tower. Racks of herbs stood drying in neat rows along the southern wall, their sweet scent carrying on the breeze. A vegetable garden had been started in what used to be the parade ground, practical rows of cabbages and turnips that Mistress Elba insisted would see them through winter.

But it was the small touches that made it more than a military post—laundry lines strung between towers like festival banners, a bench placed to catch the evening sun, flower boxes that Finn had installed "to make it friendlier," despite good-natured mockery from the veterans. Someone had even painted the Last Light Company's symbol—a lantern surrounded by stars—above the main gate, the paint still fresh enough to gleam.

Grimjaw paused at the hilltop, his ancient eyes taking in every detail with an engineer's assessment. "Hmph," he grunted. "It's... active."

"It's what we have," Veyra replied, but she heard the pride creeping into her voice despite herself. "For now."

"Good bones," Grimjaw said, surprising her. "Whoever built it understood stone. The foundations go deep—can see it in how the walls sit. That eastern tower's leaning a hair, but that's fixable. The well's in the right place to never run dry. And someone knew what they were doing with those sight lines—can see trouble coming from any direction."

"You got all that from one look?" Thorne asked, impressed.

"I got that from how it's still standing after decades of neglect," Grimjaw corrected. "Bad construction fails fast. Good construction fails slow. Great construction..." He nodded toward the Watchpost. "Great construction waits for someone to remember why it was built."

As they approached the gates, a figure burst from the stable—Finn, the young stablehand they'd taken in after finding him sleeping in an alley, beaten by his former master for refusing to neglect a sick horse. His face lit up with joy that seemed to brighten the entire courtyard.

"Captain! Commander! You're back! With friends!" He skidded to a stop, remembering protocol at the last moment and attempting a salute that was more enthusiasm than precision.

"With family, Finn," Thorne corrected gently, returning the salute properly, giving the boy the dignity of being treated as a true member of the company.

Finn's eyes, wide with the wonder that hadn't yet been beaten out of him by the world, settled on Grimjaw. The dwarf stood like a piece of the mountain itself—solid, ancient, unmovable. "Are you really a dwarf?" the boy asked, then immediately flushed. "I mean, I've never seen... that is..."

"No," Grimjaw rumbled, his eyes twinkling with unexpected humor. "I'm a very short human with excellent taste in beards."

Finn's jaw dropped, his young face a study in confusion. "Really?"

"No, boy," Grimjaw chuckled, the sound like distant thunder rolling through deep caves. "I'm a dwarf. And you're... what? Twelve?"

"Fourteen, sir!" Finn said proudly. "And three quarters!"

"The quarters matter at that age," Grimjaw said solemnly. "Tell me, boy-of-fourteen-and-three-quarters, do you know the difference between granite and sandstone?"

"Um... one's harder?"

"Which one?"

"Granite?" Finn guessed.

"Good guess. Want to know why that matters?"

"Yes, sir!"

"Then you can help me unpack. I'll teach you about stone, and you'll teach me about this place. Fair trade?"

Finn nodded so enthusiastically his whole body moved. "Yes, sir! I know everything! Where everyone sleeps, where the good food is hidden, which steps creak, where the cats like to sun themselves—"

"Cats?" Grimjaw interrupted. "This place has cats?"

"Three of them! They keep the mice down. Mistress Elba says they earn their keep better than half the soldiers."

"Speaking of which," a voice called from the kitchen door. Mistress Elba emerged, flour dusting her apron like snow, her iron-gray hair with copper streaks braided back in traditional dwarven style that had lost its fight with several errant strands. At barely four feet tall, she was built like a dwarven fortification—broad-shouldered, solid as mountain stone, and absolutely unmovable when she chose to be. Her amber eyes held the calculating look of someone who had fed armies. "Finally! Someone who'll appreciate proper portions!"

She looked Grimjaw up and down with the practiced assessment of a grandmother who knew exactly how much food a body needed based on size, profession, and temperament—and whether they'd been eating properly.

"Depends," Grimjaw said, crossing his arms and matching her measuring stare. "Can you cook, or do you just heat things until they surrender?"

"Can you eat, lad, or do you just complain until someone feeds you?" she retorted without missing a beat, wiping her flour-dusted hands on her apron.

They locked eyes for a moment, two immovable dwarven forces meeting. Then Grimjaw smiled—a real smile that transformed his craggy face. "Challenge accepted, grandmother."

"Good. Dinner's in two hours. Don't be late, or you'll get what's left, and what's left is usually claimed by Tomaq."

"Tomaq?" Grimjaw asked.

His question was answered by the emergence of a massive figure from the main tower. The orc had to duck his head and turn slightly sideways to clear the doorframe, a practiced movement that spoke of years navigating spaces built for smaller folk. Tomaq was gray-skinned where most orcs were green, his left tusk broken off halfway, the remains capped with silver. Watch-Sergeant chevrons were sewn onto his pauldron with precise stitches—his own work, Veyra knew, as the orc was surprisingly talented with a needle.

He carried a two-handed battle-axe in one hand, the weapon looking almost delicate in his massive grip. His one good eye—the other hidden behind a leather patch—surveyed the group with professional assessment.

"Another stray?" Tomaq rumbled, his voice like grinding millstones.

"Another specialist," Thorne corrected, falling into the easy pattern of their friendship. "Master Grimjaw Ironbeard, meet Sergeant Grushak, called Tomaq. He keeps us from falling apart when you're not terrorizing us with training."

"We're running out of room," Tomaq observed, though his tone suggested this was merely a tactical consideration rather than a complaint. "Eastern tower's full. Western's got the armory. Northern's half-collapsed."

"I'll fix that," Grimjaw stated matter-of-factly. "Stone tells me it just needs proper shoring. Week's work, maybe less. Then you'll have room for another dozen."

"Just like that?" Tomaq asked, his one eye narrowing with interest.

"You got stone?" Grimjaw asked.

"Got a whole quarry's worth in the ruin across the way. Previous occupants started repairs, never finished."

"You got mortar?"

"Can get it."

"Then yes, just like that." Grimjaw set down one of his packs with a thud that suggested its weight. "I got skill, you got materials. Simple equation."

Tomaq studied the dwarf for a long moment, then nodded slowly. "You were at Mithral Deep."

It wasn't a question. Grimjaw stiffened slightly. "You heard about that?"

"Everyone heard about that. You saved forty-three miners from a complete collapse. Lost thirty trying to save more."

"Twenty-seven," Grimjaw corrected quietly. "Three died later from the injuries."

"You counted."

"I always count. Someone should remember the exact number. They deserve that much."

Tomaq nodded again, deeper this time—one warrior acknowledging another's burden. "There's ale in the pantry. The good stuff Thorne thinks I don't know about."

"I knew you knew," Thorne protested.

"I know you knew I knew," Tomaq replied, the faintest hint of a smile tugging at his remaining tusk. "Welcome to the Westwall, Master Ironbeard. We're all broken here, but we're working on fixing each other."

As the group began dispersing, Mistress Elba caught Grimjaw's arm with surprising strength for someone her size. "You'll want to see the kitchen and storage before dinner," she said, more command than invitation. "Professional courtesy—one dwarf to another."

Grimjaw raised an eyebrow but followed her to the converted kitchen space. It was organized with military precision, every pot hung at optimal reach, every supply labeled and sorted. The pantry was equally meticulous—shelves stacked with preserves, dried goods, and root vegetables arranged by type and season.

"Impressive," Grimjaw admitted, running a hand along a shelf. "You know your craft."

"Aye, fed three mining clans before I came here," Elba said with pride. "Though I've got to say, these Watchpost storage spaces are adequate now, but I've seen companies grow." She gestured at the shelves with a knowing look. "Mark my words, we'll be juggling vegetables within the year. Maybe sooner if the Commander keeps recruiting strays."

"Speaking from experience?"

"Always," Elba replied. She pulled out a particularly large, prize-worthy turnip from a basket, holding it with the care most people reserved for newborns. "This is Bertha. Been growing her for three seasons. Brought her with me when I joined the Company."

Grimjaw stared at the turnip, then at Elba, then back at the turnip.

"You... named your turnip?"

"She's not just *a* turnip," Elba corrected, her tone suggesting this should be obvious. "She's won two autumn festivals and survived a cart overturn that killed half her patch-mates. Bertha's earned her name."

"You're serious."

"As stone," Elba said, carefully returning Bertha to her basket. "I see that look, Master Ironbeard. You talk to rocks and listen to mountains. I name my vegetables. We all have our ways."

Grimjaw's expression shifted from bewilderment to grudging respect. "Fair point, grandmother. Fair point."

Fayne had cleared a space in the stable's loft—dry, secure, with a view of the courtyard through a loading door that could be opened for air and light. It wasn't much, but Grimjaw surveyed it with the same careful attention he'd given the mine collapse.

"Is this adequate?" Veyra asked, already mentally cataloging what they'd need to make it more comfortable.

"A roof that doesn't leak, walls that don't shake, and honest work to be done," Grimjaw said, testing the floor boards with his weight. "It's more than adequate, Commander." He pulled out his tools, beginning to arrange them immediately. "It's potential."

"We can—"

"Commander," Grimjaw interrupted gently. "I've lived in a self-imposed exile for fifteen years. This—" he gestured to the space, to the window showing the courtyard where Finn was excitedly telling other young recruits about the dwarf who'd be teaching them about stone, "—this is already more home than I've had in all that time."

That evening, the entire company gathered in the main hall. It had been transformed from a stark military mess into something warmer—tapestries covering the worst of the stone walls, benches softened with cushions "liberated" from a noble's discarded furniture, the long table scarred but clean, set with mismatched plates and cups that somehow made it feel more real than matching sets ever could.

The lantern—Veyra's lantern, the one that had survived the canyon—sat in the center of the table, its light casting warm shadows on faces both new and familiar. Aldwin had prepared tea for those who wanted it, while Tomaq's "hidden" ale had made a mysterious appearance.

"We need to talk about what we are," Veyra said, standing but not formally, just a woman addressing her chosen family. "We're not a company yet, not officially. The Watch tolerates us because we're useful. The nobles ignore us because we're beneath notice. The common folk..." She paused. "The common folk are starting to know our name."

"What name?" Kelen asked, his deep voice curious. "We've been called many things. The Scarred Company. The Ash-Marked's Misfits. Those Crazy Bastards at the Westwall."

"I like that last one," Venn muttered, earning chuckles.

"We need a real name," Veyra continued. "Something that tells people what we are. What we do."

"What are we then?" Kelen asked.

"A promise," she replied, her hand resting on the lantern. "A promise that no one burns alone. That no one dies forgotten in the dark. That when everything else fails, when everyone else has given up, we're still there."

"To everyone who burns alone," Aldwin murmured, understanding. "To everyone lost in their own darkness."

"That's a heavy promise," Halden said.

"We're heavy people," Veyra replied with a slight smile.

"Speak for yourself," Grimjaw grumbled from his corner. "I'm perfectly proportioned for my height."

The laughter that followed was genuine, the kind that came from shared understanding. Even Tomaq's rumbling chuckle joined in.

"But seriously," Darric said as the laughter died down. "What do we call ourselves?"

People threw out suggestions—The Marked, The Rescued, The Stubborn Bastards (Venn's contribution), The Reforged (from Grimjaw). Each had merit, but none felt quite right.

Then Fayne, who'd been sketching quietly in their ever-present notebook, spoke up: "What about the Last Light?"

The words seemed to hang in the air, visible as the lantern's glow. As if responding to the name, the flame steadied and brightened, casting warmer light across the gathered faces.

"Say that again," Veyra said softly.

"The Last Light Company," Fayne repeated, more confidently. "When everything else goes dark, we're the last light burning. When everyone else gives up, we're the last light of hope. We're not the first responders—we're the last resort. The last light before the darkness wins."

Silence settled over the room, but it was the silence of recognition, of something clicking into place.

Veyra touched the lantern, its glass warm beneath her scarred fingers. "When everything else fails..."

"We burn on," Thorne finished, understanding.

"A light for the lost," Aldwin added, his gentle voice carrying clearly.

"A beacon for the broken," Tomaq rumbled.

"And ale for the found," Grimjaw boomed, raising his mug.

"The Last Light Company," Kelen said, testing the words. "It fits. We're all here because we refused to let our light go out, even when we had every reason to. Now we keep that light burning for others."

"Look at that," Venn said quietly, nodding toward the lantern. "Either that flame's agreeing with us, or it knows something we don't."

"We'll need more than a name," Veyra said, practical even in this moment of naming. "We need structure. Resources. More people."

"More what?" Thorne asked.

"Everything," she replied honestly. "People who understand what we're building. Supplies to keep us running. Connections to know where we're needed. Power to actually make a difference."

"Start with people," Grimjaw advised, his engineering mind already working. "Everything else builds from that. Wrong foundation, whole thing collapses."

"The right people," Aldwin corrected gently. "Those who understand that saving a life is about more than just preventing death."

"The broken people," Veyra said, her voice carrying the weight of personal understanding. "The ones who've been through the darkness and came out the other side different. Not better, not worse, just... changed. The ones who understand that sometimes the greatest strength is admitting you need help."

"Why broken?" Halden asked, though his tone suggested he already knew.

"Because the broken know how to rebuild," she replied. "They know what it costs. They know why it matters. And they know that breaking isn't the end—it's just another beginning, if you choose to make it one."

"Where do we find them?" someone asked.

Veyra lifted the lantern, holding it high so its light reached every corner of the room, dancing across faces marked by scars both visible and hidden. "We don't find them. They find us. We just have to keep the light burning bright enough for them to see."

As the evening wore on, the formal gathering evolved into something more natural—Grimjaw had somehow ended up in a drinking contest with Tomaq, the two of them matching each other mug for mug while Mistress Elba provided a running commentary on their declining coherence. Finn and the younger members sat in a circle around Aldwin, who was telling them a story about a brave mouse who saved a lion—a parable about how small acts of kindness could have great consequences.

Veyra found herself on the wall walk with Thorne, looking out over Waterdeep as the city settled into night. Lights twinkled below like earthbound stars, each one a life, a story, a potential crisis or salvation.

"You really think we can do this?" Thorne asked quietly. "Build something that's never existed before?"

"We already have," Veyra replied. "Look at them." She nodded toward the courtyard where their unlikely family was gathered. "An orc Watch-Sergeant who stayed loyal when his unit abandoned him. A halfling healer who sees death as a doorway rather than an ending. A dwarf engineer who speaks the mountain's language. Veterans who chose conscience over orders. Young ones who still believe the world can be better."

"And us," Thorne added. "A captain who refused to abandon his post and a commander who walked through hell and decided to go back for others."

"The Last Light Company," Veyra said, tasting the name again. "I like it."

"It's who we are," Thorne agreed. "The ones who keep burning when everything says we should go out."

A sound from below caught their attention—Grimjaw had started singing. It was a dwarven mining song, the words incomprehensible but the melody hauntingly beautiful. One by one, others joined in, humming along with the parts they didn't know, creating a harmony that had nothing to do with musical skill and everything to do with belonging.

"We should go down," Thorne said. "Be part of it."

"In a moment," Veyra said. "I want to remember this. The night we became something more than just survivors. The night we became the Last Light Company."

The lantern in the hall below glowed steadily, its light spilling out through windows and doors, a beacon in the darkness. Somewhere in the city, someone lost and desperate might see it and know that hope existed. Somewhere, someone broken might recognize kindred spirits. Somewhere, someone who had given up might decide to try once more.

The Last Light Company had found its name, its purpose, its home. Now the real work could begin.

The next morning came too soon for some—Grimjaw and Tomaq were notably subdued at breakfast, though neither would admit defeat in their contest. But hangover or not, the work of building something new didn't pause.

Grimjaw was already examining the northern tower, making notes in a small leather journal, occasionally knocking on stones and listening to their response with an intensity that bordered on reverence. Finn followed him like a shadow, absorbing every word about load-bearing walls and stress distribution with the focus of a natural student.

Aldwin had begun organizing the infirmary properly, with Halden's eager assistance. The halfling's collection of herbs and medicines was extensive, and his method of organization was both practical and somehow beautiful—jars arranged by use and season, creating a rainbow of healing along the shelves.

Thorne worked with the fighters, running them through drills that emphasized rescue over combat—how to clear debris, how to carry injured, how to work as a team when strength alone wasn't enough. Tomaq watched from the side, occasionally barking corrections that made veteran soldiers jump like recruits.

And Veyra stood in her makeshift office, looking at a map of Waterdeep and the surrounding lands. Red pins marked recent disasters, blue pins marked potential allies, black pins marked places where they'd been too late. But now there were green pins too—places where the Last Light Company had made a difference.

"Commander?" Fayne appeared at the door. "There's a messenger from the Dock Ward. Another fire, but smaller. They're asking for us specifically. They're asking for the Last Light Company by name."

Veyra smiled, the expression pulling at her scars but genuine nonetheless. "Then we'd better not disappoint them. Sound the bell. Tell everyone we have work to do."

As Fayne ran to comply, Veyra touched the lantern on her desk—not the original, that stayed in the hall, but a smaller version, travel-sized but no less meaningful. Its light flickered but held steady, just like the company it represented.

The Last Light Company was no longer just an idea or a hope. It was real, it was needed, and it was ready.

The light would not go out.
