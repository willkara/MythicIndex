The message had arrived before dawn, carried by a merchant's courier who'd ridden through the night despite the winter storm. Ice still clung to his cloak as he stood shivering in the doorway, his horse's flanks steaming in the pre-dawn cold. Veyra read the hastily scrawled note aloud in the common room of the Westwall Watchpost, her breath forming small clouds in the morning chill despite the roaring fire that struggled against winter's grip.

"My son ventured into the Old Thornwood Ruins three days past. He has not returned. I fear the worst. Please, I have heard of your company's work. I can pay."

The parchment trembled slightly—whether from the cold or urgency, none could say.

Thorne was already checking his winter gear, leather creaking stiffly in the cold as he pulled on thick wool-lined gloves. Ice crystals had formed overnight on the metal buckles, and he had to work them loose with practiced movements. "Thornwood's a day's ride north in good weather. In this snow, with the drifts as they are, day and a half through these drifts. Those ruins are deadly enough in summer—in winter, with ice hiding the pitfalls, frozen stone ready to shatter at a touch..."

"Collapsing architecture, unstable foundations, now covered in ice that makes every surface treacherous," Grimjaw grumbled, his breath steaming as he fastened his heavy winter cloak over his reinforced leather apron. The dwarf's fingers, usually so sure, fumbled slightly with the frozen clasps. "Stone becomes brittle in deep cold. What held in autumn might shatter like glass now. It's a frozen deathtrap for anyone who doesn't know how winter changes stone."

Aldwin quietly packed his medical supplies, his movements deliberate and careful. The glass vials of medicine had to be wrapped in wool to prevent freezing, and he added extra warming salves and frostbite treatments to his kit. "The cold alone could kill him if he's trapped. Three days in winter temperatures, the body begins to shut down. First the extremities, then..." He didn't finish the sentence.

"We leave within the hour," Veyra commanded, already calculating supplies in her head. Her scarred face, usually impassive, showed the tight focus of someone who knew every minute counted in winter. "Venn, ready the wagon with extra blankets and heating stones—the enchanted ones from the locked chest. We'll need enough to last two days if we're delayed. Kelen, gather the winter climbing gear—ice picks, crampons, and the specialized rope that won't freeze brittle."

The Last Light Company moved with practiced efficiency, but the cold made everything harder. Buckles resisted frozen fingers, leather straps had to be worked loose from where frost had seized them, and every piece of metal burned with cold even through gloves. Winter rescues were the most dangerous—racing against both time and temperature, where a simple delay could mean the difference between rescue and recovery.

They met the client at the edge of Millbridge, arriving in the evening of the second day after their slow winter journey, a small farming village that huddled against the winter wind like a child seeking shelter in Thornwood's shadow. Smoke from chimneys rose straight up in the still, frozen air, and the few villagers brave enough to be outside moved quickly between buildings, heads down against the cold.

Mrs. Harriet Blackwood waited at the inn, wrapped in multiple shawls that couldn't hide her shivering—though whether from cold or fear was unclear. Her breath came in quick puffs of steam, and her lips had taken on a bluish tinge from standing in the doorway watching for them.

"Thank the gods you've come," she said through chattering teeth, her hands trembling as she clutched at Veyra's sleeve. Ice had formed on her eyelashes from tears that had frozen before they could fall. "My Thomas, he's a good boy, but he got it in his head that there was ancient treasure in those ruins. I told him not to go, especially not in winter when the stones shift and crack, but he's twenty summers now, thinks he knows better than his mother."

"When exactly did he leave?" Thorne asked, stomping snow from his boots. The ice that had accumulated on the journey cracked and fell in sheets.

"Three days ago, just after the dawn snow stopped. He took a pack, rope, his father's old sword, winter provisions for two days—" Her voice cracked like ice under pressure. "His father died in those same ruins, ten years past. Fell through ice-weakened stone into a crevasse. The cold took him before anyone could get him out. I can't lose Thomas too. Not to the same frozen death."

Veyra's good eye softened slightly, though frost from her breath had crystallized on her scarf, giving her an almost ethereal appearance. "We'll find him, Mrs. Blackwood. Can you tell us exactly which entrance he planned to use?"

"The old east gate, same as his father always warned against. He said—" She paused, looking past them toward the snow-covered square where her breath suddenly caught. "Thomas? THOMAS BLACKWOOD, WHAT IN THE NINE HELLS ARE YOU DOING HERE?"

The Company turned as one, leather and mail creaking in the cold, to see a young man emerging from the baker's shop. He was brushing flour and snow from his cloak with one hand while balancing a steaming meat pie in the other, his arm wrapped around a pretty blonde girl whose cheeks were rosy from more than just the cold. His face went from winter-flushed contentment to absolute horror in the span of a single visible breath.

"Ma? What are... who are all these armed people?" His voice cracked like a boy's, the pie nearly slipping from suddenly nerveless fingers.

Mrs. Blackwood's relief transformed into maternal fury with impressive speed, her trembling ceased as rage warmed her better than any fire. "Where have you BEEN? I thought you were frozen to death in those ruins! I've been seeing your corpse in every shadow for three days!"

"The ruins? Ma, I told you I was going to Thornwood!"

"You said THORNWOOD!"

"THORNbrook! The village! To visit Lily!" He gestured desperately at the girl beside him, who looked like she wanted to melt into the snowy ground despite the freezing temperature. "I told you three times! I left a note on the kitchen table!"

"You mumbled something about Thor-something and treasure! In this weather, with your voice all muffled by that scarf, I thought—"

"Lily's father is a jeweler! I was asking about apprenticing! I said I'd found my treasure when I met her! It was romantic!" The young man's face had gone from pale to bright red, clashing terribly with his winter clothes. "I've been staying above their shop to avoid traveling back in the storms! We were being responsible!"

A profound silence fell over the assembled Company, broken only by the whistle of winter wind and the distant sound of ice cracking on a roof. Their breath hung in the air between them like a physical barrier. Grimjaw was the first to speak, his words accompanied by a massive cloud of steam in the frigid air.

"We came all this way," he said slowly, each word deliberate, "through a bloody three-day snowstorm, ice forming on my beard, my axes, even my bloody bootlaces, for a lad who can't speak clearly to his own mother?"

Aldwin's gentle chuckle followed, muffled by his scarf but warm with genuine amusement. "Young love does tend to create more emergencies than actual blizzards. And it seems to impair communication even more than frozen lips."

Even Thorne, ever professional, was fighting to keep his expression neutral. The corner of his mouth twitched dangerously beneath his frost-covered beard, ice crystals catching the weak winter sun.

Then something unprecedented happened. Veyra laughed.

It wasn't much—just a short, surprised bark of sound that sent a large puff of steam into the winter air—but it transformed her face completely. For a moment, the weight of loss and responsibility lifted like morning frost in sudden sunlight, and she looked younger, lighter, almost carefree.

"We just..." she managed, pulling her scarf down to reveal an actual smile that cracked the thin layer of frost on her cheeks, "we just mobilized a full winter rescue mission, rode through a blizzard, nearly lost Halden's fingers to frostbite, for a boy afraid to tell his mother about a girl."

The entire Company stared. Venn's mouth actually fell open, his words coming out in rapid puffs of disbelief.

"Did... did the Commander just make a joke?" he whispered to Darric, his breath forming a small cloud between them.

Veyra immediately tried to school her expression back to its usual stern set, but the damage was done. A smile kept tugging at her scarred lips, fighting against her attempts at severity. "Right. Well. Move out. We're burning daylight, and this weather won't hold. The clouds are building again."

"But Commander," Fayne said, clearly trying not to grin as ice crackled on his cloak when he moved, "shouldn't we bill for services rendered? Emotional rescue from maternal worry? Hazard pay for the frozen extremities?"

"Fayne," Veyra warned, but there was unmistakable warmth in it.

Mrs. Blackwood, meanwhile, had grabbed her son's ear through his hood—no mean feat with frozen fingers. "You're paying these good people for their time, Thomas Blackwood. Every copper, plus extra for making them travel in this weather! And you're paying for their horse's winter feed!"

"Ma! Not in front of—ow, ow, ow!"

The journey back began with lingering amusement from the morning's comedy, but the winter road had its own plans. Fresh snow had fallen while they were in Millbridge, adding another hand's breadth to what already choked the path. The slow progress back through accumulated snow would extend their normal travel time, turning what should have been a day's journey into a careful trek through treacherous conditions. The horses struggled through drifts that reached their bellies, their breath coming in great gouts of steam that froze into ice crystals on their muzzles. They had to stop frequently to clear ice from the horses' hooves and to knock accumulated snow from the wagon wheels before it froze solid and locked them in place.

The cold was a living thing, seeking every gap in their clothing. It crept through the tiniest spaces between glove and sleeve, found the one spot where a scarf didn't quite meet a hood. Exposed skin began to ache, then burn, then grow dangerously numb. They rotated positions frequently, those on horseback taking turns in the slightly warmer wagon to prevent frostbite.

"This cold's not natural," Grimjaw muttered, his words barely audible through the thick scarf wrapped around his lower face. Ice had formed on his eyebrows and beard, making him look like some ancient winter spirit. "I've lived through forty winters, and this has a bite to it that speaks of something more than just the season."

Despite the harsh conditions, they were all in unexpectedly good spirits. The shared absurdity of the morning had created a warm camaraderie that helped fight the cold. Grimjaw was telling stories of his own romantic disasters, punctuating them with visible puffs of breath.

"So there I was, middle of winter like this, covered in rock dust and snow, holding wildflowers I'd climbed an ice-covered cliff to get—nearly lost three fingers to frostbite in the process—and her father opens the door instead. Turns out she'd been married for three months and forgot to mention it!"

They had taken the forest road, longer but more sheltered from the worst of the wind. The trees stood like frozen sentinels, their branches so laden with snow that some had cracked under the weight. The afternoon sun barely penetrated the white canopy, turning their world into a hushed cathedral of ice and shadow. Their voices seemed muffled, as if the cold itself swallowed sound.

The temperature continued to drop as afternoon wore on. Ice began forming on their scarves from their breath, and everyone's movements became stiffer, more deliberate. That's when Veyra raised her hand, signaling a stop. The leather of her glove crackled with the movement, ice breaking from the joints.

"What is it?" Thorne asked, immediately alert. Ice crystals on his eyebrows caught what little sunlight filtered through, making him look almost otherworldly.

"Listen," she said, and her breath hung in the air like a spirit given form.

They did. The forest was silent. Too silent. Even in winter, there should be some sound—wind through branches causing snow to fall, the crack of ice-stressed wood, the occasional winter bird. But there was nothing. The silence was so complete it seemed to press against their ears.

"That's not right," Veyra murmured, her breath hanging in the still air like a warning. The horses shifted nervously, their ears swiveling, nostrils flaring as they sensed something wrong. Then, as if triggered by her words, every bird in the forest suddenly took flight—ravens, winter wrens, even the hardy cardinals that usually weathered any storm. They burst from the trees in a cacophony of cries, streaming overhead in the same direction, their wings beating desperately against the cold air. Snow cascaded from disturbed branches, creating a localized blizzard around them.

"Follow them or investigate?" Thorne asked, already knowing the answer. His hand had moved to his sword hilt, though drawing steel in this cold would be painful.

Veyra was already turning her horse toward where the birds had fled from, her mount's hooves crunching through the frozen crust that had formed over the deeper snow. "We investigate. Something's wrong, and in this cold, wrong means deadly."

They moved carefully through the snow-laden undergrowth, the unnatural silence growing heavier with each step. The trees here were ancient, their trunks so thick with ice that they looked like frozen waterfalls. Their horses' breath came in nervous puffs that crystallized instantly in the frigid air. The cold seemed deeper here, as if they were moving toward the heart of winter itself.

"There," Grimjaw pointed through the frost-covered trees, his voice barely above a whisper. "In the clearing."

The raven didn't move. Not when they first spotted the dark shape against the pristine snow, a splash of midnight on white canvas. Not when they realized it was watching over a body that lay still as stone. Not even when they approached, their boots breaking through the frozen crust with sounds like breaking glass. It simply sat there, black against white, its dark eyes reflecting nothing but patient observation, ice crystals glittering on its feathers like diamonds.

"Is that person...?" Halden began, his voice muffled by his scarf, afraid to finish the question.

"Alive," Aldwin said quietly, already dismounting. His boots sank deep into the snow as he moved forward. "Barely. See the breath misting? It's faint, but it's there. The cold has slowed everything down—it might be the only reason she's still with us."

The figure was a woman, half-buried in the morning's snowfall. Her lips had gone past blue to nearly purple, her skin so pale it seemed translucent, like ice itself. Frost had formed on her eyelashes and in her hair, giving her an otherworldly appearance. But what caught everyone's attention wasn't just her presence—it was the scene around her.

"Are those... leaves?" Venn asked, bewildered, his breath coming in quick puffs.

Indeed, the woman was partially covered in a makeshift blanket of dead leaves, pine needles, dried grass, and even moss—anything the animals could find that wasn't frozen solid to the ground. The arrangement wasn't random; it showed careful thought. The materials were layered with the dried leaves closest to her body for insulation, pine needles over that for structure, and moss packed into any gaps. Around her, in a rough circle, were small offerings that seemed almost ritual in nature—winter berries still on their stems, acorns that must have been cached from autumn, bits of bark arranged in small piles, even what looked like fur that some creature had shed to add to her warmth.

"The animals," Veyra breathed, her words creating small clouds in the frigid air. "They've been trying to keep her warm. Look—those are rabbit tracks, and there, fox. Even what might be bear, though they should be hibernating."

Grimjaw knelt, his knees sinking deep into the snow as he examined the arrangement with an engineer's eye. "This isn't random. Look at this—they've built a windbreak with branches on her north side, where the worst of the wind would come from. These aren't just dropped materials—they've been deliberately woven together, layered for maximum insulation. And see here? They've even created a small depression around her to trap what little body heat she has left."

"I've heard tales of such things in the deepest winters," Aldwin said softly, already pulling warming stones from his pack with fingers that shook slightly from cold and awe. "But never seen it myself. Animals caring for a human as if she were their own, especially in winter when every calorie, every bit of warmth is precious for their own survival. This is... this is something beyond natural."

As if his words were a signal, the forest erupted in protective fury. A badger emerged from beneath the snow, its breath steaming as it hissed, ice crystals on its whiskers catching the light. Rabbits thumped warnings from their winter burrows, the sound muffled by snow but unmistakably threatening. Birds circled overhead, their cries sharp with threat, wings beating hard against the cold air. A fox appeared, its thick winter coat bristling with more than cold, baring teeth that gleamed like ice. Even squirrels chattered aggressively from the frost-covered trees, throwing small branches and ice chunks at the intruders.

But not the raven. It simply watched, seemingly unbothered by the cold that should have driven it to seek shelter, its dark eyes moving from the Company to the woman and back.

"Easy," Aldwin said, his voice taking on that special quality he used with the frightened and dying. It seemed to carry despite the muffling snow, warm and comforting. "Easy now. We mean no harm. We're here to help."

The animals didn't retreat, forming a living barrier between the Company and the fallen woman. Their breath created a fog of steam in the cold air, a wall of living warmth protecting one of their own.

"They're protecting her," Thorne observed, adjusting his winter cloak as he assessed the situation. "Even in this killing cold, when they should be conserving energy for their own survival, they stayed."

Aldwin slowly dismounted, his movements deliberate and non-threatening despite the bulk of his thick winter garments. He began to hum—a low, soothing melody that seemed to resonate in the hushed clearing, warming the air with its gentle tone. One by one, the animals' aggressive postures softened, though they didn't retreat. Their eyes remained watchful, ready to act if the strangers proved false.

Then the woman stirred, frost cracking on her clothing like breaking glass. Her eyes opened—just barely, one green, one hazel, both glazed with cold and exhaustion—and she raised one trembling hand that had gone past white to a dangerous blue-gray.

"It's... okay," she whispered, her voice barely audible, each word accompanied by the faintest wisp of steam. "They're... okay. Friends... not foes."

The effect was immediate. The animals didn't leave, but they pulled back, creating a path through the snow. Their eyes remained watchful, but the aggression had transformed into wariness. The raven finally moved, hopping to a higher branch for a better view, sending down a small cascade of snow that glittered in the weak sunlight.

"Aldwin," Veyra commanded. "Quickly. We're losing light and the temperature's dropping."

Aldwin worked with swift efficiency, though the cold made everything harder. His hands moved surely despite the thick gloves he couldn't remove—exposed skin would freeze to anything metal in seconds. He checked for frostbite, finding dangerous white patches on her fingers and toes, while checking her core temperature with practiced touches to her neck and wrists.

"How long has she been here?" Venn asked, stamping his feet to keep circulation going. The cold had begun to seep through even their winter boots.

"Hours at least, probably since last night when the temperature dropped below killing cold," Aldwin said, his face grim. "The animals' intervention absolutely saved her life. Their body heat, the insulation they provided... without them, she'd have been dead hours ago. But we need to warm her slowly. Too fast and her heart could stop from the shock."

"Will she survive?" Veyra asked, her scarred face tight with concern that had nothing to do with the cold.

"With care, yes. But we need to warm her gradually. Halden, prepare the warming tent in the wagon—use the mild stones first, not the hot ones."

They worked together with practiced coordination despite the numbing cold. They wrapped her carefully in layers of wool, placing lukewarm heated stones around her—not touching, but close enough to slowly raise the air temperature around her body. The animals watched every movement, ready to intercede if they sensed threat. The raven had moved closer again, perching on the wagon's edge where ice crystals formed on its feathers, making it look like some creature of winter myth.

As they lifted her, she stirred again, her eyes focusing with effort on Veyra's scarred face.

"The light," she mumbled through chattering teeth that clicked like dice. "Followed... the light... through the snow... so bright..."

"Save your strength," Veyra said gently, tucking another blanket around her.

"My brother... have to find... the snow took him... seven winters..." Her voice grew more desperate despite its weakness. "He's lost in the white... always in the white..."

Then unconsciousness claimed her again, her body going limp.

Veyra's expression tightened with recognition that had nothing to do with the cold. The desperate search for family, the willingness to die trying in winter's grip—she knew that particular anguish intimately. Her own hands trembled slightly, and not from the temperature.

"We take her back," Veyra decided, her voice carrying the weight of personal understanding. "Aldwin, do whatever you need to. She doesn't die on our watch."

"Understood, Commander."

As they settled her in the wagon's warming tent, carefully arranging the heated stones to create a cocoon of gradually increasing warmth, the raven suddenly cawed—a single, sharp sound that echoed in the winter silence like a bell. Then it flew ahead, not far, just to the next tree, where it waited. When they moved, it flew to the next, and the next, as if leading the way.

"That's not normal raven behavior," Fayne observed, pulling his cloak tighter as the wind began to pick up. "Ravens don't guide. They follow or flee."

"Nothing about this is normal," Thorne replied, watching as other forest animals began to follow them at a distance—foxes slinking through the underbrush, rabbits hopping from cover to cover, even a few deer visible through the trees. "But then again, when is it ever?"

Back at the Westwall Watchpost, they'd converted a storage room near the kitchens into a makeshift infirmary—the warmest room they could find, where the heat from the ovens seeped through the stones. They'd brought in extra braziers, and the temperature difference from outside was so extreme that everyone's armor and clothes immediately began steaming.

The woman—they still didn't know her name—lay still, bundled in furs and surrounded by a careful arrangement of warming stones that Aldwin adjusted every hour. Her color had improved from deathly white to merely pale, and her breathing had steadied from barely-there to regular, if shallow. The raven, which had followed them all the way back, perched outside the frost-covered window, maintaining its vigil despite the wind that should have driven any sensible bird to shelter. Ice formed and reformed on its feathers, but it didn't move.

"The animals at the clearing," Halden said to Aldwin as they changed her bandages and applied salve to the frostbite damage, "in winter, to see that kind of cooperation... different species working together..."

"She has a deep connection to them," Aldwin replied, gently working feeling back into her frozen fingers. "Druids often do, but this... for animals to risk winter exposure themselves, to share precious food stores when every calorie could mean their own survival... this is something beyond training. This is love."

Veyra stood in the doorway, still in her winter cloak though the room was warm enough to make her sweat. She watched Aldwin work, remembering her own recovery, her own desperate moments in the cold. "How long until she wakes?"

"Hard to say. Her body needs to recover from the hypothermia, but there's also magical exhaustion. Whatever she was doing out there in that storm, it drained her to dangerous levels. The fact that she could still communicate with the animals while near death... she's strong."

On the third day, as weak winter sun streamed through the window, creating patterns of frost and light on the floor, she finally stirred with purpose. Veyra was there, having taken to checking on her between other duties. The woman's eyes opened—one green, one hazel, both now clear and aware—and immediately sought the window.

"Echo," she said, her voice raspy but urgent.

The raven cawed in response, its breath visible through the glass, ice crystals falling from its beak.

"That's its name? Echo?" Veyra asked, moving closer.

The woman's gaze shifted to her, wary now, taking in the scars, the weapons, the confident bearing. "Who are you? Where...?" She tried to sit up, winced, and fell back.

"You're safe. I'm Commander Veyra Thornwake of the Last Light Company. We found you in the forest, nearly frozen to death. The animals were trying to keep you alive."

"I know what you're going to say," the woman said, her voice gaining strength with each word. "'You nearly died.' 'You shouldn't travel alone in winter.' 'You need to be more careful.' I've heard it all before, every winter for seven years."

Veyra's scarred face shifted into something that might have been understanding. "Actually, I was going to ask if you'd like some hot broth. Mistress Elba makes it with enough pepper to warm you from the inside out. And maybe your name."

The woman blinked, caught off-guard by the lack of lecture. "Vera. Vera Moonwhisper."

"Well, Vera Moonwhisper, you gave your animal friends quite a scare. They tried to keep you warm through a killing winter night. They risked their own lives for you."

"They did?" A small smile touched Vera's chapped lips, though it clearly hurt. "They're good friends. Better than most people."

"The only kind worth having," Veyra agreed. "Now, when you're ready—and only when you're ready—perhaps you can tell us what you were doing out there in a snowstorm that would have killed most people in hours. But first—warmth, food, and more rest. Healer's orders, and Aldwin doesn't take no for an answer when it comes to his patients."

Aldwin appeared in the doorway with a steaming bowl that filled the room with the scent of herbs and warmth. "Ah, our winter wanderer awakens. Excellent timing. I've prepared a warming broth with herbs for recovery—ginger for circulation, willow bark for pain, and just a touch of something to help you sleep properly."

As Vera struggled to sit up, still shivering slightly despite the warmth of the room, Veyra found herself saying, "Your brother. You mentioned a brother, lost in the snow."

Vera's entire body tensed, her eyes going sharp despite her weakness. "How did you—?"

"You spoke while delirious. You said the snow took him, seven winters ago." Veyra's voice was gentle but carried weight. "I... understand the search. The desperation that drives you out into winter storms. I lost people too, people I was supposed to protect. Fire took them, not snow, but the searching, the desperation—that's the same."

Their eyes met, and something passed between them—recognition of a shared wound that would never fully heal.

"Did you find them?" Vera asked quietly, hope and fear warring in her voice.

"No. They were already gone. But I found something else. A purpose. A way to make their loss mean something." Veyra gestured to the room around them, to the sounds of the Company beyond the door. "A way to ensure others don't face that searching alone."

"I've been looking for seven years," Vera whispered, tears that she'd held back suddenly flowing. "Everyone says to give up. That winter took him, that the Silent Hand doesn't give back what it takes. But I can't. He's my little brother. He was only twelve."

"Hope is a tool," Veyra said, the words coming from some deep place she rarely accessed. "You've been using it like a whip, driving yourself forward until it breaks you. Learn to use it better—not as a chain that binds you to the past, but as a compass that guides you forward. Even through the coldest storms."

Vera stared at her, something shifting in her expression—a loosening of desperate tension, a recognition of another path. Outside, Echo cawed once, as if in agreement, his call muffled by the frost on the window but clear in its support.

"Rest," Veyra said, standing. "When you're stronger, we'll talk more. You're safe here, and warm. And you're not alone."

As she left, she heard Vera whisper, "Thank you."

The words followed her into the corridor, warming her more than any fire.

A week passed with the winter weather worsening, but inside the Watchpost, Vera recovered with surprising speed. She helped in small ways at first—mending winter gear with clever stitches that reinforced weak points, preparing warming herbs that Aldwin needed, always with Echo nearby despite the cold. The raven had taken to spending time inside, though he always returned to his window perch, as if standing guard.

Her presence had changed the atmosphere subtly. The animals around the Watchpost had become more visible—birds gathered on windowsills, mice emerged from their winter hiding spots without fear, even the stable cats seemed calmer. It was as if nature itself had accepted the Watchpost as a safe haven.

Then came the morning when Thorne burst into the common room, shaking snow from his cloak, ice falling from his armor in sheets. "We have a problem. Remember the Hendrick family? Their daughter's gone missing. She was playing near the Thornwood—the actual Thornwood this time—yesterday afternoon and hasn't come back. In this weather, with night falling..."

"How long?" Veyra asked, already reaching for her winter gear.

"Since yesterday afternoon. The local guard searched but the fresh snow covered any tracks. The temperature dropped to killing cold again last night." His face was grim. "She's six years old."

"The ruins are treacherous enough in summer," Grimjaw said, already reaching for his axes. "In winter, with ice everywhere, a child that small... if she's fallen into a crevasse..."

Vera stood up, steady now despite a slight tremor in her hands. "I can help."

Everyone turned to look at her.

"I can track her, even through fresh snow," Vera continued, her multicolored eyes bright with determination. "It's what I do. It's what I've always done, every winter, searching. I know how the snow hides and reveals, how ice preserves sign that would otherwise vanish."

"You're still recovering," Aldwin protested. "The cold nearly killed you—"

"I'm well enough. And that little girl doesn't have time for us to wait for spring." She looked at Veyra, and there was steel in her gaze. "You saved me from the winter. Let me help you save her."

Veyra studied her for a long moment, weighing, deciding. "What do you need?"

"Just Echo. And maybe..." she hesitated, "someone who knows these woods in winter. Someone who understands that sometimes the dangerous path is the only one left."

"I'll go with you," Veyra said without hesitation. "Grimjaw, Aldwin, Venn—you're with us. Your engineering eye might spot structural dangers in those ruins, and we'll need medical expertise if she's injured. Venn, your sharp eyes might spot what we miss."

"Aye," Grimjaw rumbled, already pulling on his heaviest cloak. "Ice-weakened stone is twice as treacherous. One wrong step could bring a wall down."

Venn nodded eagerly, checking his bow despite the way the cold would make the string brittle. "Been itching to do more than watch supplies freeze, Commander."

"Thorne, prepare the others with warming supplies and a wagon," Veyra continued. "Set up a warming station at the forest edge. If we find her trapped, we'll signal for the full team."

Watching Vera work was like watching an artist paint with winter itself as her canvas. At the edge of Thornwood, where the girl had last been seen, Vera knelt in the snow, her fingers barely grazing the surface of the drifts. Echo perched on her shoulder, his black form stark against her frost-covered cloak, occasionally cawing in what seemed like conversation.

"She went this way," Vera said, pointing toward the ruins through the swirling snow that had begun to fall again. "Small feet, moving quickly at first—excited. But she wasn't alone."

"What do you mean?" Veyra's voice carried an edge of steel.

"Someone was with her. Or following her." Vera's multicolored eyes narrowed as she studied barely visible depressions in the snow. "Adult, heavy boots, trying to step in her footprints to hide their track. They didn't count on the wind shifting after they passed, exposing the edges." Her expression darkened like a winter storm building. "This wasn't a child wandering off. This was a taking."

They moved swiftly through the winter forest, Vera occasionally pausing to examine a broken icicle, disturbed snow beneath protected overhangs, or the way frost had been brushed from a tree trunk. Her movements were fluid despite the cold, as if winter itself was her element.

Then she did something that made Veyra stop in amazement.

Vera's eyes rolled back, becoming completely white like fresh snow, and when she spoke, her voice was distant, hollow, as if coming from very far away. "Echo sees... old foundation, walls of stone half-buried in drifts, collapsed roof beams crossed like broken bones. Blue mitten caught on rusty iron. North-northeast, maybe three hundred yards. Underground entrance, recently cleared. Heat rising from below—warm bodies, multiple."

Her eyes returned to normal, green and hazel again, and she swayed slightly, catching herself on a tree. Frost immediately formed where her hand touched the bark.

"What was that?" Venn whispered, awe clear in his voice.

"The world through Echo's eyes," Vera explained, her breath coming harder now. "I can share his sight, feel what he feels. It's... draining, especially in this cold. Every moment connected burns energy I need to stay warm."

They found the mitten exactly where Vera had described, a small splash of color against the white. And more—heavy boot prints around a cleared entrance to what looked like an old root cellar, the snow deliberately kicked over to hide the disturbance.

"She's down there," Vera said with absolute certainty. "And she's not alone. The winter wrens sheltering in the ruins heard crying an hour ago, and..." she paused, tilting her head as if listening, "they heard other children too."

"Other children?" Grimjaw's hand moved to his axe.

Vera nodded grimly. "The birds say at least three young voices. And adult voices giving orders. This is organized."

-->

The cellar was more than it appeared—a trafficking waystation cunningly insulated against winter but still cold enough to see breath. The stairs descended into darkness that smelled of fear and unwashed bodies. They found not just the Hendrick girl, but three other children, all bound with rough rope, shivering in the corner. Their captor—a man the village had trusted as a winter supplies merchant—stood guard, unaware of their approach.

Vera moved like winter wind itself—silent, inevitable, deadly cold. Echo dove at the trafficker's face, black wings beating, talons raking, while Vera's staff found the back of his knees with a crack like breaking ice. He went down hard, his head striking frozen stone.

As Grimjaw secured the trafficker with knots that would hold even in the cold, binding his hands with spare rope, the man spat blood onto the frozen floor and laughed, a sound like ice cracking.

"You think you've won?" His breath came in painful gasps. "The Silent Hand has fingers everywhere. Winter's our harvest season—easier to move 'cargo' when the roads are empty, when people huddle inside instead of watching."

Vera went rigid, every muscle tensing. She crossed the space in two strides, her staff pressing against his throat with enough force to make him wheeze. "The Silent Hand? You're part of them?"

The trafficker's eyes widened at her intensity, recognition dawning. "Wait, you're—you're the mad tracker! The one who's been hunting us for years! The witch who talks to birds!"

"Where are they?" Vera's voice was deadly quiet, colder than the winter air. "Where is their main operation?"

"I don't know! We work in cells! But..." he glanced fearfully at the bound children, his voice dropping, "this was supposed to be the last collection before the spring shipment north. They move them when the ice roads are solid, up through the mountain passes that are only accessible in deep winter—"

He tried to spit at her, a final act of defiance. "You'll never find them all. We're like winter itself—inevitable, recurring, patient. Your brother? After seven years? He's probably been sold three times over by—"

He never finished. Vera's staff, still pressed against his throat, suddenly transformed. Black thorns erupted from the wood—not normal thorns but ones that glistened with frost, dripping with an unnatural cold that seemed to burn. They wrapped around his neck with deliberate slowness, each thorn piercing skin, drawing drops of blood that froze instantly. The vines constricted with the patience of winter itself, inexorable and without mercy.

The trafficker's eyes bulged, his mouth opening in a silent scream as the thorny vines tightened. Frost spread from where they touched, his skin going white, then blue, then black with frostbite. The temperature in the room seemed to drop even further.

Vera watched without expression as the life left his eyes, as his body went rigid with cold as much as death. Only when he was still, frost covering his entire throat like a crystalline collar, did the vines retreat, withering back into her staff as if they'd never existed, leaving only the frozen corpse.

Grimjaw sighed heavily, his breath a massive cloud in the frigid air. It wasn't moral judgment but practical frustration. "Dead men don't answer questions, lass. Could've gotten more out of him about their operations, their routes, their contacts."

"He told us enough," Vera said flatly, turning to the rescued children who huddled together for warmth. "Spring shipment north. Ice roads through mountain passes. Working in cells. Winter harvest season." She knelt by the children, her voice gentling. "You're safe now. We're going to take you home, get you warm."

"Thank you," the Hendrick girl whispered through chattering teeth, her lips blue with cold.

As they evacuated the children, wrapping them in every spare blanket and cloak they had, Aldwin tended to rope burns and frostbite with gentle efficiency. Vera stood over the corpse for a moment longer, frost still glittering on her staff.

"Seven years I've hunted you," she whispered to the dead man. "Seven winters of searching. This is just the beginning."

As they emerged into the winter daylight, the children clinging to their rescuers, Vera spoke quietly to Veyra. "This is how it happened. My brother. Taken in winter, when travel is hard and searches are delayed by weather. The Silent Hand knows exactly what they're doing—they use winter as a weapon, as cover."

"You've been hunting them alone?" Veyra asked, noting the exhaustion in Vera's eyes that had nothing to do with the cold. "Through seven winters?"

"Who else would help? Everyone thought I was mad, obsessed, chasing shadows in the snow. Maybe I was. Maybe I am."

Veyra looked at the rescued children being bundled into the warm wagon, at her team working with practiced efficiency despite the numbing cold, at this strange woman who commanded winter itself and had just saved four young lives.

"You're not mad," Veyra said firmly. "You're driven. There's a difference. And you don't have to hunt alone anymore."

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying the Last Light Company could use someone with your skills. Someone who can track through blizzards, who understands the language of winter and wild both. And maybe, together, we can find more than just missing children. Maybe we can find the ones who take them."

Vera looked at her, then at Echo, who cawed softly, ruffling his feathers against the cold. Ice crystals fell from his wings like tiny diamonds. "You'd trust me? After what you just saw me do?"

"I saw you save four children without hesitation. I saw you use winter itself as a tool. I know what it's like to carry guilt and purpose through endless seasons." Veyra extended her hand, steam rising from her warming stone. "The Last Light Company helps those who burn alone in the dark. Seems to me you've been burning alone through too many cold nights."

Vera looked at the offered hand for a long moment, snow beginning to fall around them. Then, slowly, she took it. The warmth of the contact seemed to surprise her.

"Alright," she said. "But I'm not giving up on finding my brother."

"I wouldn't expect you to. In fact, I'd help you look. We'd all help. That's what a company does—we search together."

For the first time since they'd found her, Vera truly smiled, an expression that transformed her face from winter-stark to something warmer. Echo cawed what sounded like approval, spreading his wings wide before settling again.

Two weeks later, as winter winds howled like hungry wolves outside, Vera stood in what would become her room at the top of the Watchpost tower. It had a large window that opened onto a snow-covered balcony, perfect for Echo's comings and goings.

"It's perfect for Echo," Aldwin said, helping her arrange her few possessions—a worn traveling pack, a collection of small carved animals, maps marked with seven years of searching. "High enough to see approaching weather, and we've installed a warming brazier for the birds. They'll have a warm roost even in the worst storms."

"It's more than I need," Vera protested, though her fingers traced the window frame with something like wonder.

"It's exactly what you need," Veyra corrected from the doorway. "A tracker needs to see, and your bird friends need access to you, even in winter. This is your aerie now."

Already, several winter birds had found the heated balcony—cardinals, blue jays, even a pair of doves—chirping at Echo, who seemed to be holding court, sharing whatever news birds share.

"Welcome to the Last Light Company, Vera Moonwhisper," Thorne said formally, though warmth colored his voice. "May you find what you seek."

"And may what I seek not freeze me in the finding," Vera replied, completing the old tracker's blessing.

That night, as the Company gathered for dinner in the warm common room while the winter storm raged outside, Vera found herself surrounded by something she'd forgotten existed—acceptance. The warmth wasn't just from the roaring fire or the mulled wine. It was in the way Aldwin quietly ensured her cup never emptied, how Grimjaw made space for her at the table without comment, how Veyra included her in planning discussions as if she'd always been there.

"So there I was," Grimjaw was saying, well into his cups and gesturing dramatically with a turkey leg, "middle of the worst blizzard in twenty years, and this lass—gorgeous thing, legs that went on for miles even through the snow—she says to me, 'Grimjaw, if you can make it to my cottage through this storm, I'll make it worth your while.'"

Venn leaned forward eagerly, as did several others. Even Vera found herself listening, a small smile playing at her lips.

"And like a fool in love, I tried! Fought through snow up to my chest, wind that could've knocked over a giant, temperature cold enough to freeze spit before it hit the ground—all for the promise of a warm bed and warmer company." Grimjaw laughed, a deep rumbling sound that seemed to warm the room. "Made it to her door half-frozen, icicles in my beard longer than my arms, can't feel my extremities—any of them, if you catch my meaning—"

"Grimjaw!" Aldwin protested, though he was clearly fighting laughter.

"What? It's a medical concern in those temperatures! Anyway, I get there, expecting passionate gratitude, and you know what I find?" He paused dramatically, taking a long pull from his tankard. "Her husband. Home early from the mines because of the storm. Turns out she wanted me to 'fix her roof' because it was leaking. In a blizzard! The woman wanted me to patch a roof in a blizzard!"

The table erupted in laughter, Vera's own surprised laugh joining the chorus.

"Did you fix it?" Vera asked, surprising herself by joining in.

"Course I did! I'm a dwarf of my word, even if that word was tragically misunderstood. Fixed that roof with frozen fingers and fury in my heart. The husband, decent fellow actually, gave me hot soup and good whiskey. We drank until dawn while his wife glared at both of us." Grimjaw shook his head. "Learned that night that when a beautiful woman makes promises in a snowstorm, get the terms in writing first. Preferably notarized."

"Speaking of clarity," Aldwin said gently, refilling Vera's cup with warm cider that steamed in the cool air, "I've been researching herbs that might help with the exhaustion from your sight-sharing with Echo. There's a Northern tea blend that ranger conclaves use—"

"Tea?" Vera asked, a small smile tugging at her lips. "Not one of your 'special' teas, I hope? I've heard stories about your gentle passages."

The table erupted in laughter again. Even Aldwin chuckled. "No, no. This one's purely for recovery. Though if you ever need the other kind, well, that's a conversation for another time."

"Aldwin!" Veyra scolded, but she was fighting a smile.

"What?" the healer said innocently. "I'm simply offering my full range of services. It's called being comprehensive."

The conversation was interrupted by a sudden blur of black feathers. Echo swooped down from his perch, snatched a piece of roasted chicken directly from Grimjaw's plate with surgical precision, and flapped back to his roost in one smooth motion. The distinctive raven call that followed—a sharp *caw-caw-caw*—sounded remarkably like laughter.

"By the stone!" Grimjaw bellowed, staring at his now chicken-less plate. "That bird just robbed me!"

Echo tilted his head, made a series of soft clicking sounds, and continued tearing into his prize with obvious satisfaction.

"What did he say?" Grimjaw demanded, pointing accusingly at the raven. "I know he's saying something!"

Vera's expression remained perfectly deadpan. "He says you were holding your fork incorrectly. Poor dining posture. He was simply correcting a tactical error."

"The bird did *not* say that!"

Another deliberate *caw*, this one somehow managing to sound smug.

"He's also noting," Vera continued in the same clinical tone, "that you left your food undefended while gesturing. In the wild, that's an invitation. He's actually being quite complimentary about your storytelling—says it was distracting enough to make the theft easy."

The table erupted in laughter. Even Grimjaw, after a moment of sputtering indignation, joined in.

"Your bird has opinions about my table manners?" he asked, torn between offense and amusement.

"Ravens are very particular about efficiency," Vera replied, maintaining her serious expression. "Echo believes everything should serve a purpose. Your dramatic gesturing served the purpose of making his dinner accessible."

"Well then," Grimjaw said, spearing another piece of chicken and holding it up to Echo, "here's to efficiency. And to ravens who are honest thieves instead of lying flatterers."

Echo cawed what might have been acceptance, swooped down to take the offering with surprising gentleness, and returned to his perch.

"He says you're learning," Vera translated, a tiny smile finally breaking through. "Slowly."

Venn leaned toward Vera conspiratorially. "So how exactly does the sight-sharing work? Do you become the raven? See exactly what Echo sees?"

"Not exactly," Vera said, warming to the genuine curiosity. "It's more like... looking through a window that's also looking back at you. Echo and I, we share the moment. I see through his eyes, but he also feels my intent. It's a partnership."

"That's beautiful," Halden said quietly. "A partnership, not control."

"Exactly." Vera looked at Echo, who was contentedly preening on his perch near the fire, occasionally accepting treats from Fayne. "He saved my life, you know. Before you all found me. He's been watching over me for years, ever since..." she paused, then continued, "ever since I started hunting alone."

"To partnerships then!" Thorne raised his cup. "To the bonds that keep us warm through the coldest winters."

"To found family," Veyra added, her scarred face soft in the firelight. "To those who choose to stand together against the storm."

"To the Last Light Company!" they chorused, cups clinking.

As the evening wore on, stories flowing as freely as the ale, Vera watched this strange assembly of soldiers, healers, engineers, and now herself—a half-mad tracker who commanded winter and death with equal ease. They were all broken in some way, all carrying scars visible and hidden, all searching for something. But together, around this fire while winter raged outside, they were becoming something more. Something stronger.

"Never thought I'd have this again," Vera said quietly to Echo. "A warm place. People who don't flinch when I do what I do."

The raven cawed softly, and for once, Vera chose to take it as agreement rather than coincidence.

Outside, the winter storm howled its fury, but inside the Westwall Watchpost, the Last Light Company had created their own warmth—not just from the fire, but from the bonds they were forging, one rescued soul at a time.
