      CHAPTER 8 VARIATIONS (INTRODUCTION ARC):
      - SCENE 04-05 (Discovery): Near-death, half-buried in snow. Lips purple-blue, skin translucent
        pale like ice itself. Frost on eyelashes and hair. Covered in animal-built leaf/moss blanket.
        Eyes barely open—one green, one hazel, glazed with cold.

        Wrapped in furs, surrounded by warming stones. Eyes clearer, wary of strangers.

        when sight-sharing with Echo. Staff in hand, frost forming where she touches bark.
      - SCENE 09 (Frost Execution): Cold fury, expressionless face. Black frost-thorns erupting
        from staff. Seven years of grief made lethal.

        with surgical precision. Cawing what sounds like laughter.

          white canopy—hushed cathedral of ice and shadow. Voices muffled as cold swallows

          covered in animal-built blanket of leaves, pine needles, moss. Offerings arranged
          around her—winter berries, acorns, fur. Animals forming protective circle: badger
          hissing, fox baring teeth, rabbits thumping warnings. Pale winter light, stark

          boots trying to hide in her footprints. Wind-exposed edges reveal the deception.

          unwashed bodies. Four children bound in corner, shivering. Cold blue light, frost
          gleaming on stone walls. Site of Vera's frost-thorn execution—black thorns erupting
          from staff, crystalline collar of death forming on trafficker's throat.

      Wide establishing shot of a pristine snow clearing in frozen forest. A single black raven
      sits motionless on a low branch, directly above a woman's form half-buried in fresh snow.
      The raven is a splash of midnight against pure white canvas, ice crystals glittering on
      its feathers like diamonds. The woman (Vera) is barely visible beneath a makeshift blanket
      of dead leaves, pine needles, and moss—carefully arranged by animal friends. Small
      offerings surround her: winter berries, acorns, bits of fur. The forest behind is frozen
      cathedral—ice-laden branches, weak winter light filtering through. Nothing moves but the
      raven's watchful eyes.
    composition_notes: |
      Ultra-wide cinematic framing emphasizes the isolation and vast white silence. Raven
      positioned on rule-of-thirds vertical, creating strong focal anchor. Vera's form creates
      horizontal grounding element. Negative space of snow field dominates, emphasizing
      the smallness of life against winter's vastness. Eye travels from raven down to woman.

      meat pie, his arm around a hiding girlfriend. An older woman grabs his ear through his hood,
      frozen tears cracking on her face as fury replaces relief.
      Behind them, a group of armed and armored rescuers stands in various states of disbelief—
      a dwarf with mouth agape, a captain fighting a smile beneath frost-covered beard.
      But the focus is on a scarred female commander pulling down her scarf to reveal an actual
      smile, frost cracking on her cheeks, a rare moment of genuine amusement.
      Weak winter sun, frost-bright comedy lighting, breath clouds visible.
      Farce tableau—heavily armed rescuers, romantic teenager, furious mother.
