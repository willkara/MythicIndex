    visual_description: |
      Black thorny vines erupt from Vera's staff, glistening with frost. Wrapped around trafficker's throat. Blood drops freeze instantly to red ice. Frost spreads across his skin. Vera watches without expression. Grimjaw in background frustrated. Huddled children in shadows.

      Medium framing. Eye-level. Thorns create diagonal of violence. Vera still vs dying trafficker. Blood frozen mid-fall.
