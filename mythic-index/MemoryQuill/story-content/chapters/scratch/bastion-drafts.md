Bastion: Ongoing Hint Seeds and Draft Inserts

- Location frame
  - Sword Mountains, west of Kryptgarden; sea fog, onshore storms, sheer cliffs; Aethermount as a blind spur peak that hides in weather.
  - Keep mentions indirect; 1–2 direct “Sword Mountains” references across existing chapters are enough for now.

- Core myth cues (rotate lightly)
  - Resonance: metal hum deepens before storms; lantern flames steady near certain cairns; frost rosettes echo spiral wards.
  - Ethos check: “honesty belongs to its bearer” is diegetic—oath/intent matters more than force.
  - Camouflage: stone presents different faces to different observers; fog reveals/hides paths.

- Geography breadcrumbs
  - Old coastal survey habits: triangulation from cairn triads at dawn; “coastal spur” route notes; storm-rated bearings kits.
  - Water logic: springs from snowmelt + fog drip; short torrents toward the coast; no Dessarin headwaters.

- Outer vs inner threshold
  - Outer works usable as HQ; inner heart remains sealed by drum-and-axis assembly that wants “more than force” (attunement/oath/chorus/timing).

Draft inserts (small, paste-ready)

- Ch11.5 letter postscript (expert caveat)
  - “Postscript: Subtle salt-etching on exposed ridges suggests a coastal range origin. Sword Mountains work would fit the pattern better than the deep forest schools.”

- Ch14 desk resonance (weather cue)
  - “Outside, the pressure drop before the storm made the metal almost hum—as if listening.”

- Ch17 first look (coastal veil)
  - “Sea-fog sometimes climbed the western face and vanished against the stone.”

- Ch17 inner heart hint (non-literal lock)
  - “Behind the grand gate, a sealed drum-and-axis assembly waited—unmoving, as if it required more than force to answer.”

- Ch18 environment beat (coastal proximity)
  - “A thin sea fog clung to the outer stone that morning, a reminder of the coast hidden beyond the range.”

Future drip ideas (for later chapters)

- Star-angle scrap
  - A surveyor’s slate with two angles and a note: “third stand collapsed; resection by dawn.” Gives Vera a method scene.

- Monastery marginalia
  - A saint’s line: “Turn not the door but the day; when stone remembers, light will answer.” Use as epigraph or found text.

- Failed forgery rumor
  - “House Grell tried a cast—the mountain spat it at a quarter-turn.” Stakes + uniqueness.

- Weather-listening test
  - Rylan notes the lock’s hum syncing to a pressure drop—“as though it was hearing the sky.”

- Name-claim moment
  - After inner heart opens: a brief christening that earns “Bastion of Last Light.”

Notes to self (consistency)

- Keep “lock/key” as in-world misread; layer expert caveats so later reveals feel earned, not retconned.
- Limit direct geography tags; prefer sensory (fog, salt, storms) and craft/ledger clues.
- Maintain tone: semi-mythic, pragmatic characters interpreting signs rather than delivering exposition.
