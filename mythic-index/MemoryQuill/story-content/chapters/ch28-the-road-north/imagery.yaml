      - SCENE 03 (Stream): Kneeling by stream bank, webbed fingers dipping into current.
        Sea-glass blue-green skin with visible turquoise currents moving beneath when
        working with water. Thick dreadlocks from deep sea-green at roots to sea-foam
        white at tips, bound with verdigris-patina copper wire. Gray eyes like rain
        about to fall, shifting to slate with storm clouds when detecting taint.
        Harbor-blue oilskin longcoat, bare feet on wet stone.

        fluid hypnotic grace. Expression of calm focused intensity sharpening to
        resolute determination when reading water. Small vial of ever-moving water

      swirling toward her hands as she reads the water. Her thick dreadlocks cascade
      over her shoulders, the gradient from sea-green to sea-foam white catching
      the fading light, copper wire bindings visible. Her gray eyes have shifted
      to slate—storm clouds gathering in her irises as she comprehends the horror.

      Medium shot of Vera Moonwhisper moving through the Thornwood Forest. She flows
      between ancient trees with silent predator grace, her lean rangy build suited
      to this environment. Her dark brown braided hair with feathers, bone beads,
      and leather cords trails behind her. Her hazel eyes are alert, constantly
      scanning. She wears earth-toned leather and canvas designed for silent movement.
      Above the forest canopy, Echo the raven is visible soaring against dappled
      light filtering through leaves, his keen eyes scanning for movement. The forest
      is a labyrinth of massive trunks, winding game trails, and hidden hollows.
      Spring thaw has made the ground muddy, but Vera moves without leaving trace.
      She is one with this environment—the tracker hunting.

      In the foreground, silhouettes of the reconnaissance team—Veyra's distinctive
      mohawk profile, Thorne's broad shoulders—crouch among rocks, observing.
      Below them, the Silent Hand facility is revealed: a sprawling estate that
      blends with the natural landscape. An elegant manor house seems utterly out
      of place in the rugged wilderness. Multiple guard towers rise at intervals
      along reinforced walls. Faint shimmer of magical warding systems visible in
      the air. A small lake at the heart of the facility with what appears to be
      a hidden dock. Several outbuildings scattered strategically. Late afternoon
      light casts long shadows across the valley, painting the scene in gold and
      warning. The juxtaposition of beauty and imprisonment is stark.

      Halden with his medical kit secured, Venn with bow ready. They are
      half-revealed by the mist, ghostly shapes in motion. The facility's
      perimeter wall is visible ahead—reinforced stone that seems to melt
      into the fog. Moonlight diffuses through the mist, creating an ethereal
      blue-silver glow. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and

      Close shot focused on a small drainage grate near the base of the facility
      wall, mist swirling around it. The grate is iron, aged and slightly rusted,
      barely large enough for a person to squeeze through. From within, we can
      almost see the impression of a figure—just hints of deep plum tiefling skin,
      a glint of golden eyes in darkness. The mist swirls around the grate as if
      drawn by breath from within. In the foreground, Veyra's profile is visible,
      her ear cocked toward the grate, listening. Her expression is tense hope—
      waiting for the signal. The wall looms above, but the grate is the focal
      point—the small opening that Lyra's skills have turned into an entry point.
