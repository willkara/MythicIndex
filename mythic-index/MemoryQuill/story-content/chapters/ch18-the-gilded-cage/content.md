The arrival of the Last Light Company in Waterdeep was not a triumphant parade, but a somber procession that brought the bustling city to a halt. The forty cavalrymen of Commander Atlock's personal guard, their blue and silver cloaks immaculate, formed a stark contrast to the battered, weary figures they escorted.

News had traveled faster than their wagons—messenger ravens had reached the city two days before the slow medical convoy arrived, giving citizens time to gather and officials time to prepare. Citizens lined the streets, their morning commerce forgotten. They watched in hushed silence as the Company passed. They saw the wounded on stretchers, the grim set of the defenders' faces, the splintered shields and torn banners. They saw Veyra, her arm in a sling, her scarred face a mask of controlled exhaustion.

Whispers followed them like a rising tide:

"That's them... the ones who held the Watchpost."
"Gods, look at them. They fought a whole mercenary army."
"Is that the commander? The Ash-Marked?"
"They say she commanded a dire wolf in the battle..."

The Company's legend, once a collection of tavern tales, was now being written in the open street, witnessed by thousands. They were no longer a fringe group of do-gooders. They were a recognized force, their victory and their losses on public display.

Commander Atlock led them not to a castle or a barracks, but to the Dock Ward, where the air was thick with the smell of salt, fish, and industry. Their new home was a massive warehouse complex, three cavernous buildings connected by covered walkways, all surrounded by a high stone wall.

"It's secure," Atlock said, his voice echoing as he gestured across the central courtyard towards the three structures. "The Lords' Committee has granted you this billet under the Civic Asset provision. This main building," he indicated the cavernous space they stood in, "will serve as your mess and quarters. That second building is ideal for a forge and workshop, and the third is a ready-made infirmary. The covered walkways will keep you dry. It has space for your people, your equipment, and your operations."

He was right. It had space. But it was a cage of stone and timber. The high, narrow windows let in slivers of light that only emphasized the oppressive shadows. The air was cold and still, carrying the ghosts of a thousand forgotten cargoes. It was a place of function, not feeling.

"It's... large," Fayne said, their voice small in the echoing space.

"It's a bloody tomb with a roof," Grimjaw muttered, his engineer's eye already cataloging the flaws. "Poor ventilation, damp in the corners, and the acoustics will drive a man mad."

Thorne's expression was strained, but his voice was firm. He turned to his original patrol—Kelen, Darric, Venn, and Halden. "This is our new ground," he said, his voice cutting through the gloom. "No one knows this city better than us. Fayne will give you the lists. I want you to handle the logistics. Timber for bunks, medical supplies, food that doesn't taste like it's been sitting in a crate for a year. Your knowledge of the wards is our most valuable asset right now. Make it happen."

The men nodded, a renewed sense of purpose in their eyes. This was a mission they understood.

The summons came the next day. Thorne was called to a formal hearing before the Lords' Committee for Civic Security. He went in his best uniform, with Commander Atlock at his side.

The chamber in Castle Waterdeep was designed to intimidate. Polished marble, high vaulted ceilings, and a long table where three of the city's most powerful figures sat in judgment. Captain Grimsby was also present, not as an accuser, but as a procedural expert for the Watch.

Atlock made his case with the passion of a commander defending his best soldiers, detailing their bravery, their effectiveness, and their value to the city.

Then the questions began, led by a sharp-eyed woman named Lady Aridith. "Commander, your praise is noted. But this 'Company' operates outside the chain of command. Who holds them accountable?"

Before Atlock could answer, she turned her gaze to Thorne. "Captain Brightward, I'm looking at your quartermaster's reports. There's a recurring line item for 'discretionary acquisitions'. A polite term for looting, some might say. Can you assure this committee that your Company understands the difference between a rescue operation and a treasure hunt?"

A hot flush of anger rose up Thorne's neck. *Looting?* He gripped the edge of the witness lectern, the polished wood cool beneath his knuckles. *We took supplies from the Black Hawks, who would have used them to kill more innocents. We took a corrupt merchant's ledger to stop him from starving an entire town. They see a line item on a report; I see the faces of the people we saved.* He forced his voice to remain steady, a parade-ground calm he didn't feel. This was a battlefield of words, and he was out of his element. *Easier to face a dozen mercenaries than three politicians.* "My Lady, every asset we have acquired was from hostile parties who were actively harming citizens of this region. We take what is needed to continue our work, and no more."

Captain Grimsby stepped forward, his face a mask of professional neutrality. "My Lords, the issue is not one of effectiveness, but of oversight."

*Here it comes,* Thorne thought, recognizing the maneuver. Grimsby wasn't attacking their honor, but their structure. It was a more difficult assault to parry.

"The City Watch is bound by a strict legal code," Grimsby continued, his voice calm and reasonable. "The Last Light Company is bound only by its own conscience. What happens when that conscience conflicts with the city's laws? Who is liable when their operations result in casualties or property damage?"

His arguments were calm, logical, and devastating. He wasn't attacking them; he was simply pointing out the legal and procedural chasm they represented.

The Committee deliberated for an hour. The verdict was a political masterpiece of compromise.

"The Last Light Company is hereby granted the status of 'Provisional Civic Asset,'" Lady Aridith announced. "You will be granted use of the Dock Ward warehouse complex and a stipend for supplies. However, full recognition is tabled pending the submission of a formal Company Charter, to be reviewed and approved by this committee. You have until the summer solstice to present this document."

Thorne and Atlock left the chamber with a partial victory that felt dangerously like a defeat. They had a home, but it came with a leash.

That evening, as the Company struggled to bring a sense of order to the cavernous warehouse, Marcus Heartbridge appeared. He found Veyra overseeing the setup of the infirmary, his clothes once again immaculate.

"A challenging situation," he observed, taking in the cold, impersonal space.

"We're managing," Veyra said, her tone clipped.

"Are you?" Marcus smiled. "My sources tell me the Committee was prepared to deny your billet entirely. Grimsby's arguments were quite persuasive. It seems a key vote was swayed at the last moment by a... timely reminder of a certain trade deal that would not have borne public scrutiny."

Veyra stopped what she was doing. "You interfered."

"I facilitated," Marcus corrected smoothly. "I applied leverage where it was most needed. You have your home, such as it is, because of it." He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. "Consider it a gift. Of course," he added, his smile sharpening, "such gifts often create opportunities for future collaboration. I'm sure we'll find a way for you to repay the favor."

He bowed and departed, leaving Veyra with the cold realization that their new home had been bought at a price, and the bill would one day come due.

The days that followed found a new, uneasy rhythm. The warehouse, for all its flaws, was slowly being tamed.

The new rhythm of their lives was set by the comforting ring of hammer on steel. Grimjaw had claimed the second building as his own, and the warmth from his new forge radiated out from the workshop, a welcome contrast to the main hall's persistent chill. The rhythmic sound carried across the courtyard, a steady heartbeat for their new home. He was showing Finn how to properly brace a bunk bed. "No, lad. Not like that. You want the joint to hold the weight, not the nails. See? Like this. A good dwarf builds a bed he could shelter under in a rockfall." Finn, covered in sawdust, listened with rapt attention, proud of the small, sturdy corner he was helping to build.

Thorne, however, was rarely seen. He buried himself in a small, curtained-off office, surrounded by stacks of legal texts and historical charters from across the realms. He was a soldier tasked with becoming a lawyer, and the weight of his future was heavy on his shoulders.

Veyra's first priority was Vera. The druids had confirmed that the ranger's life was no longer in immediate danger, but her spirit was another matter. They had arranged for her to be moved to a hidden druid grove within the city—a pocket of wild green tucked behind the high walls of a Sea Ward estate.

She went with Aldwin. As the Company's lead healer, he was anxious to understand the druids' methods and Vera's unique prognosis. A young druid named Gareth met them at the gate, his expression troubled.

"Commander, Brother Aldwin," he greeted them. "Thank you for coming. Her wounds are closed, but her life force gutters like a damp candle. Our healing magic... it flows over her like water over oiled stone. It will not take root."

"You mean she's resisting the magic?" Aldwin asked, his brow furrowed.

"Her spirit is," Gareth confirmed. "The transformation left a residue, a kind of chaotic energy that has soured the very water in her veins. Before we can heal her further, she must be purified. We have asked for aid."

He led them to a small, clear pool in the center of the grove where Vera lay resting on a nearby bed of moss. Kneeling at the water's edge was a woman unlike any they had seen. She was tall and strong, with broad shoulders and the practical, weathered gear of a sailor—a heavy, deep blue oilskin coat and a complex harness of rope and iron rings. Her feet were bare on the damp earth, and her thick, rope-like hair was braided in sections that shifted from deep sea-green to a pale, foamy white at the tips.

As she worked, Veyra drew closer, her eyes catching on the woman's skin. It had a pale, translucent blue-green quality, like sea-glass, and Veyra could see darker turquoise currents swirling gently beneath the surface at her throat and wrists. *A water genasi,* Veyra realized with a jolt. *Here.* The woman was not looking at Vera, but was slowly pouring a silver liquid from a vial into the pool. As the liquid met the surface, the entire pool shimmers with a soft, blue light.

"The water in this pool is now attuned to the water in the patient," the woman said, her voice as calm and steady as a deep river current. She finally turned, and they saw her eyes were the color of rain about to fall. "It feels... angry. Frightened."

Gareth made the introduction. "This is Rill Vossari, a Speaker for the Temple of Tidal Courts."

Rill gave them a slow, measured nod. "The druids can heal the vessel. I am here to cleanse the well within. Once the water in her soul is sweet again, their magic will find purchase."

"You can do that?" Veyra asked.

"I can ask the water to remember its true nature," Rill corrected gently. "Istishia teaches that all water seeks to be pure. Sometimes, it simply needs to be shown the way."

After the ritual was complete, Rill retreated to commune with the pool, leaving them to speak with Vera. Veyra sat beside the bed, while Aldwin stood back, observing with a gentle, professional distance.

"They say I almost didn't come back," Vera whispered, her voice thin.

"But you did," Veyra said, her voice softer than usual. "That's what matters."

"My brother..."

"Is still out there," Veyra finished gently. "And we will find him. Together. But first, you heal. That's an order."

Vera managed a weak smile. "Yes, Commander."

Back in the cold, echoing warehouse, the dream of a real home began to take root. The Bastion, once a half-believed legend, became a symbol of what they were working towards. The lock Marcus had given Veyra sat on her desk, a constant, tangible reminder of a future they might one day earn. It was a promise of a home built not on political compromise, but on their own terms—a place of warmth and light, a true sanctuary. A place worth fighting for.

"Timber, fresh produce, medical supplies, grain for a hundred..." Thorne read from the list Fayne had prepared, his voice echoing slightly in their makeshift command center. He, Veyra, Kelen, and Venn stood around a large crate serving as a temporary table. "This is the priority. We need to make this place livable, and fast."

He looked at Kelen and Venn. "This is your ground. No one knows the markets better. Take the list, take the coin, and make it happen."

Veyra stepped forward, her eyes scanning the list. "I'll go with you. I should understand the supply lines we're establishing."

Thorne met her gaze, his expression respectful but firm. "Normally, I'd agree. But this isn't the wilderness, Veyra. This is Waterdeep. The 'supply lines' are people we've known for a decade. It's knowing which merchant is honest, which one is a cheat but has the best goods, and which one owes Kelen a favor from that time we pulled his cart out of the harbor."

He gestured to the two men. "This is their field of expertise. We have to trust them in it, just as they trust you in a crisis. They'll check with you before finalizing any long-term contracts, but for this initial run, we need their knowledge, not just our coin."

Veyra was quiet for a moment, the logic undeniable. She was a commander, and a commander's job was to deploy their assets effectively. Here, in the city, Kelen and Venn were the specialists. She gave a curt nod. "Understood. Get it done."

Kelen and Venn exchanged a look of quiet pride and set off. The Dock Ward market was a chaotic symphony of shouting vendors, rumbling carts, and the sharp smell of fish and damp cobblestone. To the others, it was chaos. To them, it was home.

Their first stop was the Woodworkers' Guild, a cavernous building filled with the scent of sawdust and resin. Master Tegan, a man with forearms like oak branches, spotted them immediately.
"Kelen! Heard you were back in town," he boomed. "And part of that new Company everyone's whispering about. Good on you. What do you need?"
"Lumber, Tegan," Kelen said, getting straight to it. "Good, seasoned oak for two dozen bunks. And we need it yesterday."
Tegan grunted. "That's a big ask on short notice. But... considering my cousin's crane is still in one piece thanks to you, I'll see what I can do. Have it delivered by nightfall. No charge."
"I owe you one," Kelen said with a nod.
"No," Tegan corrected, clapping him on the shoulder. "Now we're even. Stay safe out there."

Next, Venn led them down a narrow side-street to a small, tidy storefront with a hanging sign shaped like a sheaf of wheat. An elderly halfling woman looked up as they entered. "Venn! It's been too long. You're looking well for a man who fights mercenaries."
"Can't complain, Matriarch Underhill," Venn smiled warmly. "We need grain. Winter stores, the best you have, enough for a hundred. We're paying full price."
Her eyes twinkled. "Always the gentleman. Not like those city boys who try to haggle over every copper. You know good quality when you see it. I'll have the boys load it onto your cart."

Their longest stop was at the Herbalists' Collective, a quiet shop that smelled of lavender and dried moss. Mistress Elara, a sharp-eyed woman with ink-stained fingers, didn't smile when they entered, but there was a warmth in her gaze.
"Sergeant Kelen. Venn," she said, her voice calm. "I heard what you did at the Watchpost. The real story, not the tavern tales. You're good men."
"We try, Elara," Kelen said quietly. "We need supplies. Bandages, salves, stitching needles... the works."
"I figured as much," she said, already pulling prepared crates from under the counter. "Been putting this aside for you since I heard you were back. Your usual order, plus extra burn-balm. You pay me what you can, when you can. You always have." It wasn't charity; it was a professional courtesy between people who had trusted each other for years.

Finally, they waded into the main market for the sundries. A fast-talking merchant tried to sell them leaky cookpots for twice their worth.
"Two silver a pot?" Venn laughed, picking one up and pointing to a pinprick of light. "I could strain my soup through this. Eight coppers a pot, and we'll take the lot."
The merchant sputtered, but saw the steel in Venn's eye—the look of a Watchman who knew every trick in the book. He sighed. "Done."

As they guided their heavily-laden cart back towards the warehouse, Kelen grunted. "Easier than fighting Black Hawks."
Venn grinned. "Aye. But the stakes are just as high." They hadn't just bought supplies; they had re-affirmed their place in the city, weaving the Last Light Company into the very fabric of Waterdeep.
