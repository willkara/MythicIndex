      CHAPTER 18 VARIATIONS (POST-BATTLE ARRIVAL):
      - SCENE 01 (Procession): Arm in sling, scarred face a mask of controlled
        exhaustion. Riding at center of cavalry escort. The "Ash-Marked" legend
        solidifying in public view.
      - SCENE 04 (Marcus): Standing in warehouse, overseeing infirmary setup.
        Clipped tone, professional. Cold realization dawning as Marcus reveals
        the debt.
      - SCENE 05 (Vera): Softer than usual, sitting beside Vera in druid grove.
        Commander's tenderness—"That's an order."
      - Throughout: Dark mohawk with shaved sides, burn scar left face (jawline
        to temple), teal tattoos on neck/arms, battered lantern at hip.
        Weatherworn leather with mismatched armor plates.

      CHAPTER 18 (THE FIXER'S LEVERAGE):
      - SCENE 04: Immaculate despite warehouse surroundings. Well-tailored
        doublet, polished boots. Smooth confidence as he reveals the debt.
        Smile sharpening as he delivers: "Such gifts often create opportunities
        for future collaboration."
      - Throughout: Average height, poised posture. Knowing smile that
        sharpens into something predatory when revealing leverage.
        Never disheveled, even in dust and shadow.

      CHAPTER 18 (THE POLITICAL GAUNTLET):
      - SCENE 01 (Procession): Riding with escort, grim set of face.
      - SCENE 03 (Committee): In best uniform at polished lectern.
        Hot flush of anger rising up neck as Lady Aridith attacks.
        Gripping lectern edge, knuckles white. Parade-ground calm
        masking fury. Out of his element—"easier to face a dozen
        mercenaries than three politicians."
      - Throughout: Watch Captain plate armor, blue cloak with sunburst.
        Stern but compassionate. Strained expression.

      CHAPTER 18 (THE ENGINEER'S ASSESSMENT):
      - SCENE 02: Standing in cavernous warehouse, dwarfed by the space.
        Engineer's eye already cataloging flaws—poor ventilation, damp
        corners, acoustics that will drive a man mad.
        Muttering: "It's a bloody tomb with a roof."
      - Throughout: Dwarven build, gruff demeanor. Practical, assessing.

      - SCENE 05: Kneeling at pool's edge in druid grove. Sea-glass skin
        with visible turquoise currents beneath surface (throat, wrists,
        cheeks). Hair in thick dreadlocks, deep sea-green to sea-foam
        white at tips, bound with verdigris copper wire.
        Eyes the clouded gray of rain about to fall.
        Pouring silver liquid that makes pool shimmer blue.
        "I can ask the water to remember its true nature."
      - Throughout: Deep blue oilskin longcoat, sailor's harness with
        iron rings. Bare feet. Strong swimmer's build, broad shoulders.
        Calm, patient focus. Holy symbol: vial of ever-moving water.

      CHAPTER 18 (RECOVERY):
      - SCENE 05: Resting on moss bed near pool in druid grove. Weak from
        transformation, spirit guttering like a damp candle. Thin voice,
        weak smile when Veyra gives "order" to heal. Transformation left
        chaotic residue—water in her veins "soured."
      - Throughout: Ranger gear, but vulnerable. Pale, exhausted.
        Hope visible despite weakness: "Yes, Commander."

          Morning in Waterdeep. Citizens lining the streets, commerce forgotten.
          Hushed silence as the somber procession passes. Cavalry in immaculate
          blue and silver escorting the battered, weary Company. Whispers rising
          like a tide: "The Ash-Marked" ... "commanded a dire wolf" ... The legend

          cleansing ritual. Silver liquid making pool shimmer blue.
          Ethereal atmosphere—healing sanctuary, spiritual recovery.

      Wide cinematic shot of the Last Light Company's arrival in Waterdeep.
      Forty cavalrymen in immaculate blue and silver cloaks form an honor
      guard, their polished armor a stark contrast to the battered, weary
      figures they escort. Wounded on stretchers, torn banners, splintered
      shields. At the center rides Veyra, arm in sling, scarred face a mask
      of controlled exhaustion. Citizens line the streets in hushed silence,
      commerce forgotten. Heads turning, whispers visible in the stillness.
      Morning light, cool and grey, catching the cavalry silver.
