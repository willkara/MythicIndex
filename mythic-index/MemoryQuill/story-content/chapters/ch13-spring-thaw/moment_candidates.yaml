    source_excerpts:
      - "Veyra (standing watch as the sun set): 'Come on then. We're ready.'"
      - "In the gathering twilight, Echo perched on the battlements and let out a single, sharp cry that echoed across the courtyard. Somewhere in the distance, other ravens answered, their calls carrying messages through the growing night."
      - "The Last Light Company waited, prepared for whatever spring might bring."
    
    selection_rationale: "Closing HERO moment that encapsulates the chapter's emotional arc. After a chapter of discovering threats from multiple directions—political pressure, surveillance, exploitation of innocents—this image shows Veyra and the Company choosing defiance over fear. The composition (low angle, silhouette, sunset) creates an iconic closing shot while the ravens' cries add auditory texture suggesting a network of warnings spreading through the night."
