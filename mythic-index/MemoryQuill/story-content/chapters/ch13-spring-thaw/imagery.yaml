      A Rock Gnome woman barely four feet tall at a cluttered workbench.
      Wild coppery-red hair in messy faux-hawk with streak of arcane blue.
      Sharp brown eyes focused on precision work. Her left arm is a masterwork
      brass prosthetic—articulated plates with glowing blue arcane conduits.
      Precision instruments and tools scattered around. Workshop lamplight
      catching on metal surfaces. Intimate craftsman portrait.
      Fantasy engineering, innocent passion.
