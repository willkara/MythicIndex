_Two weeks after the Stonebridge debrief_

The morning mist clung to the Thornwood hills like a reluctant ghost, unwilling to yield to the pale sun struggling through the clouds. Patches of stubborn snow lingered in the shadows, but the air carried the promise of change—that subtle shift in temperature and scent that marked winter's slow retreat.

Veyra adjusted her grip on the rope, feeling the familiar burn in her shoulders as she rappelled down the rocky outcrop. Twenty feet below, the merchant Harren Blackwater sat on a narrow ledge, his left leg bent at an unnatural angle, his face pale with pain and cold.

"Easy now," Aldwin called from above, his gentle voice carrying clearly in the thin air. "We'll have you up in no time."

**Harren (through gritted teeth):** "Told my wife I'd be back before the snows melted. Didn't think I'd need a rescue to keep that promise."

**Veyra (reaching the ledge, beginning her examination):** "Your horse?"

**Harren:** "Spooked at something in the trees. Threw me right into this gully. Poor beast's probably halfway back to Waterdeep by now."

Veyra's hands moved efficiently, checking for other injuries while Vera's voice drifted down from the treeline above. The ranger had been tracking the merchant's trail for the better part of the morning, reading the story of his accident in broken branches and disturbed snow.

**Vera (calling down):** "Horse went north-northeast, moving fast but not panicked. Whatever spooked it is long gone. Echo's found the trail if you want the animal recovered."

**Veyra:** "Clean break in the tibia. We can splint it here, but you'll need proper healing once we get you topside." She looked up at Aldwin. "Can you manage the weight with the pulley system?"

**Medic Halden (calling down from the top of the outcrop):** "I'm ready up here with splinting materials and a stretcher. How's his circulation below the break?"

**Veyra (checking Harren's foot):** "Good color, good pulse. The break appears clean."

**Aldwin:** "With Grimjaw's engineering and Thorne's muscle? We could lift a draft horse."

**Grimjaw (gruff voice from above):** "Speak for yourself, halfling. I'm not as young as I used to be."

The banter was comfortable, practiced. Over the past months, they'd developed the easy rhythm of a team that knew each other's capabilities instinctively. As Veyra secured the improvised stretcher around Harren, she found herself thinking about how much had changed since those early days when every rescue felt like controlled chaos.

**Harren:** "You folks do this often?"

**Veyra:** "Often enough. The hills can be treacherous, especially during the transition seasons."

**Harren:** "Heard about you in town. The Last Light Company, right? They say you pulled half a dozen miners out of the Blackvein Lode a few months ago

**Veyra:** "We had good help on that one."

**Harren:** "And there was something about bandits at an inn? And corruption in Stonebridge?"

Veyra's hands paused for just a moment in their work. Word was spreading faster than she'd expected. "People talk."

**Harren:** "Aye, they do. And what they're saying is that when regular folk need help, you answer. That's worth something in these times."

The rope went taut, and slowly, carefully, they began the ascent. As they rose, Veyra could see the last of winter's snow giving way to patches of brown earth and the first tentative green of early spring. Change was coming to the land, just as it was coming to the Company.

By midday, they had Harren secured on a travois behind Vera's recovered horse, his leg properly splinted by Medic Halden's expert hands and Aldwin's pain-relieving tea working its gentle magic. The merchant was alert enough to make jokes about his "dramatic rescue," though Veyra could see the exhaustion in his eyes.

**Halden (walking beside the travois, monitoring his patient):** "The splint is holding well, but we'll want to get him to a proper medical facility within the day. I've given him something for the pain, but a break like this needs more than we can provide in the field."

**Harren (with a weak grin):** "First time I've had a proper medic fussing over me. My wife's going to be jealous."

**Vera (walking alongside Echo, who perched on a low branch):** "Trail's clear back to the main road. No signs of whatever spooked the horse initially."

**Thorne:** "Could have been anything. Wild animal, unusual sound. Horses are skittish creatures."

**Vera:** "Maybe. But Echo's been agitated all morning. Something's not right in these woods."

**Grimjaw:** "Define 'not right,' lass."

**Vera:** "Too quiet. No birdsong except for Echo, and he's staying close instead of ranging ahead like usual. It's like something's watching."

The group moved more carefully for the rest of the journey, weapons loose in their sheaths, eyes scanning the treeline. But nothing materialized, and by late afternoon they delivered Harren safely to the healers in Millbridge, where his family waited with tearful relief.

**Halden (speaking quietly with the village healer):** "Clean tibia fracture, good alignment. I've splinted it with the break supported, but he'll need proper setting and a fortnight of rest. Watch for swelling or changes in circulation."

**Harren (grasping Veyra's hand before they left):** "Name your price, Commander. My family has coin."

**Veyra:** "We don't set prices, Master Blackwater. We help because people need help." She paused, then added gently, "Though if you feel moved to contribute to our supplies and equipment, we wouldn't refuse. Rope and medical supplies aren't free."

**Harren (pressing a small purse into her hands):** "Then take this, and know it comes with gratitude, not obligation." He looked around at the group. "And let me spread the word. People should know there are still folk willing to help without counting the cost first."

As they rode back toward Waterdeep, the late afternoon sun finally broke through the clouds, warming their faces and beginning the day's true thaw. Puddles formed in the road where ice had melted, and the air filled with the sound of running water—winter's slow surrender to spring.

**Aldwin:** "A good day's work. Simple, clean, everyone home safe." He paused, glancing at Venn. "Though I noticed you hit your head on that low branch during the descent. That makes twenty-three times this month, if my count is accurate."

**Venn (defensive):** "I was focused on the rescue! The branch came out of nowhere!"

**Halden:** "Branches don't typically move, Venn."

**Aldwin (gently):** "I've been developing a special tea blend. For spatial awareness. Helps with peripheral vision and depth perception. Perhaps we could try it?"

**Venn:** "I don't need spatial awareness tea! I just need people to stop putting branches in inconvenient places!"

**Grimjaw (rumbling with laughter):** "The lad's got a point. Nature's got terrible timing with branch placement."

**Vera:** "Echo suggests you try ducking occasionally. Just as a tactical variation."

**Veyra:** "Simple is good. We could use more simple."

**Vera:** "Don't get too comfortable with simple. Echo's still restless, and my instincts say we're being watched more closely than we realize."

**Thorne:** "The Black Hawks?"

**Vera:** "Maybe. Or something else entirely. Either way, spring is coming, and with it, all the complications winter kept frozen in place."

**Thorne:** "Speaking of complications, I have my monthly reporting duty coming up. Routine visit to the Watch Station, but given everything that's been happening..."

**Veyra:** "Keep your eyes open. If pressure's building against us, it might come from inside the Watch hierarchy first."

**Thorne:** "My thoughts exactly."

_Three weeks after the Stonebridge debrief_

The monthly reporting schedule was as predictable as the sunrise—every third week, Captain Thorne Brightward made the ride into Waterdeep proper to file his activity reports, review patrol assignments, and handle the administrative duties that kept him officially connected to the City Watch. It was routine paperwork, nothing more, but routine that couldn't be ignored without raising uncomfortable questions.

Thorne stood in the main hall of the Watchpost, adjusting his formal Watch cloak and gathering the documents he'd need for the day's meetings.

**Veyra:** "How long today?"

**Thorne:** "Just the usual. File reports with Grimsby, review next month's patrol schedules, sign off on equipment requisitions. Should be back by evening unless something unexpected comes up."

**Grimjaw:** "Want backup? Not that paperwork's dangerous, but the city's been making me nervous lately."

**Thorne:** "It's just administrative duty, Grimjaw. Besides, if I start bringing armed escorts to routine meetings, that'll raise more questions than answers."

**Vera (looking up from where she was studying a collection of documents):** "Still, be careful what you say about our recent activities. If the Silent Hand has connections in the Watch hierarchy..."

**Fayne:** "Standard operational security. Keep the official reports general, avoid mentioning specifics about Stonebridge or our current investigation."

**Veyra:** "Agreed. Handle your duties, but keep your ears open. Sometimes routine meetings reveal more than they're supposed to."

**Thorne:** "Always do. And if anything feels off, I'll find a way to get word back."

Within the hour, Thorne was riding through the awakening streets of Waterdeep, his blue City Watch cloak a familiar weight on his shoulders. The city was coming alive around him—merchants setting up stalls, early workers heading to their trades, the endless bustle of a major port city beginning another day.

The North Ward Watch Station was a solid stone building that had served as a symbol of order and authority for decades. As Thorne approached, he noted the usual complement of guards and the familiar sight of Watch horses in the stable yard. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary for a routine reporting day.

The first two hours proceeded exactly as expected. Thorne filed his monthly activity reports, reviewed patrol schedules for the upcoming weeks, and signed off on equipment requisitions. The paperwork was tedious but necessary, and Captain Grimsby's questions were perfunctory—clearly the man's attention was elsewhere.

It was only when Thorne was preparing to leave that everything changed.

**Captain Grimsby:** "Ah, before you go, Brightward. I have some gentlemen here who'd like a word. Professional consultation, you might say."

Two men in expensive clothing waited in Grimsby's office, their bearing and manner suggesting wealth and influence. Thorne recognized the type if not the individuals—merchant princes or minor nobles, the kind of people who expected the Watch to jump when they spoke.

**Captain Grimsby:** "Captain Thorne Brightward, please meet Master Cornelius Vance and Master Silas Hartwell."

**Thorne (formally):** "Gentlemen."

**Vance (studying Thorne with calculating eyes):** "Captain Brightward. We understand you've been... involved with some irregular activities recently."

**Thorne:** "I serve the City Watch as I always have. My duties are a matter of public record."

**Hartwell:** "Your duties, yes. But your associations have become a matter of some concern. This 'Last Light Company' you've been working with—they've been making waves in certain circles."

**Grimsby:** "The gentlemen represent several prominent trading concerns. They've brought some issues to my attention that require investigation."

**Thorne:** "What kind of issues?"

**Vance:** "Interference with legitimate business operations. Harassment of law-abiding merchants. Theft of private documents. The sort of vigilante behavior that undermines proper authority."

Thorne kept his expression neutral, but internally he was connecting dots. These men were nervous about something, and their description of the Company's activities was carefully crafted to paint them as troublemakers rather than heroes.

**Thorne (keeping his voice carefully neutral):** "I assume you have specific complaints to file? Witnesses to call? Evidence to present?"

**Hartwell:** "We prefer to handle these matters... discretely. Your Company has been operating without proper oversight. Perhaps it's time they learned to work within established channels."

**Grimsby:** "What these gentlemen are suggesting, Brightward, is that your divided loyalties may have compromised your judgment. They're willing to overlook past irregularities if proper arrangements can be made going forward."

**Thorne:** "Arrangements?"

**Vance:** "The Company provides valuable services, no one disputes that. But they need guidance. Proper oversight. Someone to ensure they don't accidentally interfere with... sensitive operations."

The words hung in the air like a threat wrapped in silk. Thorne understood what was being offered—and what was being demanded. Cooperation in exchange for continued tolerance. Information in exchange for protection.

**Thorne (after a carefully measured pause):** "I'll need to discuss this with my colleagues."

**Grimsby:** "Of course. But understand, Brightward, that the City Watch expects its officers to prioritize their duties to the city above all other considerations."

**Thorne:** "Understood, sir."

**Hartwell:** "We're reasonable men, Captain. We simply want to ensure that everyone's interests are... aligned."

As Thorne left the station an hour later, his mind was racing. The meeting had been a fishing expedition, an attempt to gauge the Company's vulnerabilities and his own loyalties. But it had also revealed something important—the Company's investigation into corruption had rattled cages higher up the chain than they'd realized.

He rode back toward the Watchpost with the weight of competing loyalties heavy on his shoulders. The Watch had been his life for years, but the Company had become his family. And somewhere in between, enemies were trying to drive a wedge that would destroy both.

**Thorne (to himself, as the Watchpost came into view):** "Time to choose which side of the line I'm really on."

But even as Thorne grappled with the political pressures closing in around the Company, other threads of the investigation continued to weave their way through Waterdeep's labyrinthine business networks. The Silent Hand's operations were vast and complex, touching legitimate enterprises in ways that their owners might never suspect.

_Four weeks after the Stonebridge debrief_

The workshop occupied three floors of a converted merchant house in the Castle Ward. The sign above the entrance read "Vexweld Innovations - Precision Instruments & Custom Engineering."

Inside, Cidrella Vexweld stood barely four feet tall, but her presence commanded the entire space. The Rock Gnome sorcerer-artificer moved between workstations with practiced efficiency, her wild mane of coppery-red hair styled in a messy faux-hawk with a prominent streak of arcane blue. Her sharp brown eyes missed nothing. Most striking was her left arm—a masterwork prosthetic of articulated brass and bronze plates, with glowing arcane conduits that pulsed with her own channeled sorcerous energy.

She was examining a pressure regulation device when her assistant approached. "Mistress Cid, the shipment for the northern construction project is ready for inspection. All forty-seven units."

"Good." Cid moved toward the shipping area, all business now. "Package them with the reinforced padding—long transport to rough terrain. I won't have our reputation damaged by preventable field failures."

As she supervised the packing, a delivery woman arrived with a canvas sack marked with the Scribes' Guild seal. "Package from Master Korrath's office."

Cid spread the new specifications across her workbench, her brass finger tracing the technical diagrams. "Interesting... they're planning infrastructure for much larger operations than the initial scope indicated. Water management, ventilation systems, structural support." Her tone shifted to barely contained excitement. "Exactly the kind of project we excel at."

She worked late into the evening, her prosthetic arm making precise adjustments while her mind raced ahead to the engineering challenges the new contract would present. She was an inventor at the height of her professional success—completely unaware that her masterwork designs were being used for purposes that would horrify her.

_The following evening_

The trail from Stonebridge had led through a maze of shipping manifests, equipment suppliers, and business licenses—all pointing to legitimate enterprises that should have had nothing to do with corruption or criminal activity. But one name kept appearing in the documentation they'd recovered: Vexweld Innovations, listed as a supplier of "specialized pressure regulation systems" and "custom ventilation equipment."

**Veyra (studying a business directory from their position on a nearby rooftop):** "Castle Ward, established three years ago, registered with the Artificers' Guild. Everything appears completely legitimate."

**Vera (adjusting her spyglass for a better view):** "Sometimes the most dangerous operations hide behind the most legitimate fronts."

From their position on the rooftop across the street, they had maintained surveillance of the Vexweld Innovations workshop for three days. The specialized glass in the windows made it difficult to see specific details, but the patterns of movement, lighting changes, and timing of activities told their own story to trained observers—assuming there was a story to tell.

**Vera:** "Third shift change since we've been watching. The woman who runs the place—Cidrella—she's been there since before dawn."

**Veyra:** "Dedicated to her work?"

**Vera:** "More than that. Look at how she moves around the workshop. She's not supervising—she's actively involved in every stage of production. Hands-on engineer, not just a manager." There was a note of puzzlement in her voice. "Honestly, this isn't matching any criminal operation profile I know."

Echo perched nearby, occasionally turning his head to scan for potential threats while his human companion maintained watch. The raven had learned to stay perfectly still during surveillance operations, understanding instinctively that motion drew attention.

**Veyra:** "Any signs of coercion? Guards watching the workers? Unusual security measures?"

**Vera:** "None. The workers come and go freely. I've seen them take breaks, laugh together, even argue about technical details through the windows." She sounded almost frustrated. "If this were a front operation with intimidated workers, the body language would be completely different. But there's no indication of threats, fear, or unusual control measures. It's just... a normal workshop."

**Veyra:** "What about the shipments?"

**Vera:** "Completely standard. Commercial deliveries during business hours—materials coming in, finished products going out, all properly documented with manifests and Guild seals. Professional couriers, legitimate transport companies." She paused, sounding almost disappointed. "Everything by the book."

**Veyra:** "No unusual patterns? Off-hours activities?"

**Vera:** "None. Cidrella personally oversees all major shipments. Her assistants handle routine deliveries, but she's involved in every aspect of the operation. It's... thoroughly legitimate."

Veyra processed this information, the pieces not clicking into place as expected. Everything they were observing suggested a completely legitimate operation with no signs of criminal infiltration or coercion.

**Veyra:** "This isn't what I expected to find. Based on the equipment specifications in our recovered documents, I thought we'd see signs of suspicious activity."

**Vera:** "I know. I've been watching for three days now, looking for anything unusual—irregular schedules, suspicious meetings, covert operations. Nothing. This appears to be exactly what it claims to be: a successful precision engineering business."

**Veyra:** "The technical specifications Fayne found—pressure systems, ventilation equipment. What's your assessment of the equipment itself?"

**Vera:** "Professional-grade engineering for legitimate applications. Mining operations, construction projects, water management systems. The specifications match exactly what they're advertising." She paused, clearly puzzled. "If there's a criminal connection here, it's not obvious from observing the business operations."

**Echo (series of quiet caws, looking toward the workshop):**

**Vera:** "Someone's leaving late. The gnome woman—Cidrella."

They watched as the small figure emerged from the workshop's main entrance, carefully locking multiple mechanisms before heading down the street. Even from a distance, her movements suggested exhaustion after a long day of intensive work.

**Vera:** "She locks up herself. Uses multiple security measures but nothing unusual for a precision engineering workshop. Valuable tools and materials would make it a target for thieves."

**Veyra:** "Your assessment of her?"

**Vera:** "Completely innocent. Everything about her behavior suggests someone passionate about her work, running a legitimate business, with no knowledge of any criminal connections." She sounded frustrated. "Which raises the question—how does this connect to our investigation?"

**Veyra:** "Maybe the connection isn't direct. Perhaps someone is purchasing her equipment through intermediaries, using it for purposes she knows nothing about."

**Vera:** "That would explain why we found her business name in the Silent Hand documents, but see no signs of criminal activity here. She's making legitimate products that are being misused elsewhere."

They sat in contemplative silence for a moment, watching the workshop windows go dark as the building settled into its evening quiet. The moral complexity of their investigation was growing more apparent with each revelation—sometimes the trail led not to obvious criminals, but to innocent people whose work was being exploited.

**Veyra:** "So what's our next step? We can't approach her directly without potentially compromising our investigation or destroying her business based on suspicion alone."

**Vera:** "We need to trace the supply chain from the other end. Find out who's purchasing her equipment and how it's being transported to criminal operations." She sounded troubled. "But that means we're investigating the exploitation of an innocent person rather than direct criminal activity."

**Veyra:** "That could take weeks. And meanwhile, if we're right about the applications..."

**Vera:** "People remain in danger while we follow a paper trail that leads through legitimate businesses to find the real criminals." She adjusted her equipment, preparing to withdraw. "When the enemy uses innocent people as unknowing accomplices, everyone becomes a victim."

**Echo (series of quiet caws, looking toward the street below):**

**Vera:** "Time to go. Street patrol coming through on regular rounds."

They gathered their equipment and prepared to withdraw, having learned something important but not what they had expected.

**Veyra:** "Next steps?"

**Vera:** "Back to the documents. We need to trace how her equipment reaches the Silent Hand operations—shipping companies, intermediary buyers, transport routes." She paused thoughtfully. "And we need to be very careful not to destroy an innocent person's livelihood while pursuing our investigation."

**Veyra:** "The hardest kind of case."

**Vera:** "Always is."

Meanwhile, back at the Watchpost, the Last Light Company was drawing connections between seemingly disparate threads of information. Equipment suppliers, shipping manifests, construction contracts—all pointing to an operation far more extensive than anyone had initially realized. And with Thorne's report of political pressure from within the Watch itself, the picture was becoming uncomfortably clear: they were not just investigating corruption anymore. They were targets.

_Five weeks after the Stonebridge debrief_

The air carried the unmistakable scent of spring as Veyra stood on the Watchpost's highest parapet, watching the sun rise over a city where the last patches of snow had finally surrendered to warming earth. Below in the courtyard, the Company was going through their morning preparations with the efficiency born of weeks of practice.

But today felt different. Thorne's report about political pressure from Watch hierarchy, combined with Fayne's discovery of business connections between legitimate enterprises and suspicious shipping operations, had created an atmosphere of expectation. The pieces were starting to fit together in ways that painted an uncomfortable picture. Change was coming—the question was whether they would be ready for it.

**Vera (approaching from the main courtyard):** "Grimjaw, want to take a walk with me? I need to check the perimeter trails, and Echo's been acting strange all morning."

**Grimjaw (looking up from his forge work):** "Aye, could use the stretch. These old bones need movement."

The two made their way beyond the Watchpost's immediate grounds, following the network of game trails and maintenance paths that wound through the wooded hills surrounding their position. To any observer, it would have looked like a routine security check—which, in many ways, it was.

**Grimjaw (breathing deeply as they walked):** "Good to get out of the forge for a bit. Starting to think like iron—all rigid and unbending."

**Vera (with a slight smile):** "You? Rigid? Never noticed."

**Grimjaw:** "Har. Says the ranger who catalogues every bent twig within five miles."

They walked in comfortable silence for a while, Echo gliding overhead, occasionally calling out. The morning was warming, spring asserting itself through budding leaves and softening earth.

**Vera (pausing near a cluster of oak trees after an hour of walking):** "Something's been bothering me about this section. The birds have been avoiding it for days."

**Grimjaw:** "Birds avoid lots of things. Hawks, cats, me after a long day at the forge."

**Vera:** "This is different. Look—" She pointed to the empty branches. "Prime nesting territory, perfect morning sun, but nothing. Even Echo won't fly directly over this area."

**Grimjaw (kneeling to examine the ground):** "Well now, that's interesting." He brushed aside some leaves. "This grass here—it's been flattened, but not by deer or boar. Wrong pattern."

They spent another twenty minutes examining the area, finding subtle signs—a broken twig at waist height, moss scraped from a tree trunk where someone had leaned against it.

**Vera:** "Someone's been here. Recently."

**Grimjaw:** "Aye, but they tried to hide it. See how they scattered leaves back over their tracks? Not bad work."

They continued deeper into the woods, following a ridgeline that offered views of the surrounding valleys. After another hour of careful searching, they found more evidence—another carefully concealed position, this one with a clear sightline back toward the Watchpost.

**Grimjaw (pulling out a wrapped bundle from his pack):** "All right, lass. We've been at this for two hours. Time for a break."

**Vera:** "Since when do you carry food on patrol?"

**Grimjaw:** "Since Mistress Elba started insisting. 'Can't think on an empty stomach, lad,' she says. 'Especially you, always forgetting to eat when you're focused—just like my grandson Thorin.' Stone's teeth, she packs enough food for a small army." He unwrapped thick slices of bread, cheese, and dried meat.

They settled on a fallen log, sharing the simple meal while Echo perched nearby, accepting occasional scraps.

**Vera (between bites):** "How many positions do you think we're looking at?"

**Grimjaw:** "Based on what we've found? At least three, maybe four. They're rotating to avoid creating too much wear in any one spot."

**Vera:** "Smart. But not smart enough to account for Echo and his friends. Ravens remember faces, and they talk to each other."

**Grimjaw:** "Speaking of smart, these watchers made an interesting choice." He pointed to the sight lines they'd discovered. "Good views of the Watchpost, but they're all at least three hundred yards out. Close enough to observe, far enough to run if discovered."

**Vera:** "Professional distance. Not trying to get close enough to hear conversations or see documents."

**Grimjaw:** "Just watching. Learning routines, counting heads, noting who comes and goes."

After their break, they spent another two hours systematically checking the remaining quadrants around the Watchpost. Each area revealed more evidence—a carefully hidden fire ring here, another observation post there, always maintaining that professional distance.

**Grimjaw (finding a ring of stones partially buried under leaves):** "Here's where they cooked. Cold now, but see the ash pattern? Small fires, probably only at night, shielded to avoid being seen from below."

**Vera:** "They knew what they were doing, mostly. But they made mistakes. This branch arrangement—it's too perfect, too deliberate. Nature doesn't organize itself in straight lines."

**Grimjaw:** "Not elite work, but competent. The kind of people you hire when you need reliable eyes but can't afford the Guild's best."

As the afternoon wore on, they completed their circuit, cataloguing at least five separate observation positions, evidence of multiple individuals, and a pattern of patient, systematic surveillance.

**Vera:** "They've been watching us for weeks, Grimjaw. Learning everything about us."

**Grimjaw:** "Aye. And now we know they're watching. Question is, what do we do about it?"

Three hours after they'd started, they made their way back to the Watchpost, both processing what they'd discovered. The surveillance was professional enough to be concerning, but flawed enough to suggest their enemies weren't invincible—just determined and well-funded.

They reported their findings to the gathered Company leadership, the evidence of patient observation adding weight to everyone's concerns.

**Veyra:** "How long have we been under surveillance?"

**Grimjaw:** "Based on the wear patterns and how the vegetation's recovered? At least two weeks. Maybe three."

**Fayne (approaching with an armload of documents):** "It gets worse. I've been cross-referencing our mission schedules with public records, and I found something else—there's a pattern in the business licenses and contracts. Legitimate companies providing specialized equipment and services, all connected through a web of shell organizations. Someone with access to City Watch reports would know exactly when we're operating with reduced numbers."

**Thorne:** "And someone with contacts in the merchant community would know when we're likely to be called out for specific types of emergencies."

**Veyra:** "They're not just watching us. They're learning our patterns, our capabilities, our weaknesses."

**Aldwin:** "The question becomes: are they planning to neutralize us as a threat, or recruit us as an asset?"

**Grimjaw:** "With the Silent Hand involved? My money's on neutralize."

**Thorne:** "Unless they think we can be bought or intimidated. They tried pressure through the Watch—"

**Grimjaw (interrupting):** "No, no. Your argument's got structural problems. See, you're building from the wrong foundation. They already applied pressure through official channels—that's your first support beam. It failed, which means the load's shifted. Now they need a different approach entirely. You can't reinforce a failed beam by adding more weight from the same angle. The whole argument collapses. Basic engineering."

**Thorne (staring):** "Did you just... analyze our threat assessment like it's a bridge?"

**Grimjaw:** "Everything's got structure, lad. Bad arguments fail the same way bad buildings do—improper load distribution and weak foundations. Your enemy's smart enough to recognize when one approach ain't working. They'll change tactics, not double down on failure."

**Fayne (trying not to smile):** "That's... actually a valid point."

**Grimjaw:** "Course it is. Stone doesn't lie about stress patterns, and neither do tactics."

**Vera:** "Echo's been agitated for days, and now I know why. Ravens can sense predators better than most creatures, and he's been warning us about those watchers in the hills. Whatever's coming, it's coming soon."

The group stood in contemplative silence for a moment, each processing the implications. They'd known that their growing reputation would eventually attract unwanted attention, but discovering evidence of organized, patient surveillance in their own territory drove the reality home. These weren't casual observers—they were being systematically studied by enemies with resources and purpose.

**Veyra:** "Fayne, how quickly can we implement those defensive improvements you've been designing?"

**Fayne:** "Basic fortifications? Two days if we work around the clock. Full implementation of the enhanced security measures? A week minimum."

**Grimjaw:** "I can have the forge producing caltrops and reinforcement brackets within the hour. Won't stop a determined assault, but it'll slow them down."

**Vera:** "I can establish early warning positions in the surrounding area. Echo can coordinate with other ravens to extend our surveillance range."

**Thorne:** "And I can reach out to certain contacts in the Watch. Not everyone agrees with Captain Grimsby's... flexible approach to justice."

**Veyra:** "Do it. All of it. But carefully. If we're right about the level of infiltration, any overt preparations might trigger the very attack we're trying to prevent."

**Aldwin:** "What about evacuating non-essential personnel? Mistress Elba, Finn, some of the newer Watchmen?"

**Veyra:** "Suggest it, but don't insist. If we're wrong about the threat level, forcing people to leave their posts will damage morale and our reputation. If we're right..."

**Grimjaw:** "If we're right, having civilians in the middle of a battle will get people killed."

**Vera:** "There's something else. The timing isn't coincidental. Spring means the start of the Silent Hand's operational season. If they're moving against us now, it's because we're interfering with something bigger than simple corruption."

**Thorne:** "The northern shipments."

**Vera:** "Has to be. We've identified their key personnel, disrupted their financial networks, and proven we can gather intelligence on their operations. From their perspective, we're the biggest threat to their spring activities."

**Fayne:** "Which means attacking us serves two purposes—eliminates the threat and sends a message to anyone else who might consider interfering."

**Veyra:** "Then we make sure the message they send isn't the one they intended."

As the morning progressed, the Watchpost transformed with subtle efficiency. Defensive positions were reinforced, weapons were checked and redistributed, and contingency plans were reviewed. To an outside observer, it might have looked like routine maintenance and training. But to those who knew what to look for, the Last Light Company was preparing for war.

**Mistress Elba (approaching Veyra with a steaming mug):** "All this bustle and preparation. Makes an old grandmother nervous, child."

**Veyra:** "Just spring cleaning, Mistress Elba. Nothing to worry about."

**Mistress Elba:** "Spring cleaning, she says. With enough weapons to outfit a mercenary company and Grimjaw forging enough ironwork to build a siege engine." She fixed Veyra with a knowing look, crossing her arms thoughtfully. "I may be old, Commander, but I'm not blind. Whatever's coming, you just remember—I raised three children and seven grandchildren through two border wars. We know how to duck when the arrows start flying, and we know how to keep fighting when it matters."

**Veyra:** "I'll remember."

**Mistress Elba:** "See that you do. And Commander? Give them hell."

As the day wore on and evening approached, the Watchpost settled into its new defensive posture. Sentries took their positions with weapons close at hand, while inside the main building, maps were spread across tables and emergency supplies were checked one final time.

Spring had arrived in Waterdeep, bringing with it the promise of growth and renewal. But for the Last Light Company, it also brought the promise of a test that would determine whether they were truly ready to face the enemies that had been gathering in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike.

**Veyra (standing watch as the sun set):** "Come on then. We're ready."

In the gathering twilight, Echo perched on the battlements and let out a single, sharp cry that echoed across the courtyard. Somewhere in the distance, other ravens answered, their calls carrying messages through the growing night.

The Last Light Company waited, prepared for whatever spring might bring.
