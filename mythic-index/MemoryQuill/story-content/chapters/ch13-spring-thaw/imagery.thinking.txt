This is a detailed request to create production-ready image generation specifications for Chapter 13 "Spring Thaw". Let me analyze the input:

**Chapter Summary:**
- 7 moment candidates from the Visual Story Analyst
- Characters: Veyra Thornwake, Thorne Brightward, Vera Moonwhisper, Grimjaw Ironbeard, Quartermaster Fayne, Aldwin Gentleheart (all published with canonical imagery.yaml), and Cidrella Vexweld (DRAFT - no imagery.yaml)
- Locations: Thornwood Hills, North Ward Watch Station, Vexweld Innovations Workshop, Castle Ward Rooftop, Westwall Watchpost

**Mood Distribution Planning:**
Looking at the 7 moments and their emotional content:

1. **Moment 01** - Veyra rappelling rescue (competent, morning mist)
   - Emotional color: "steady competence"
   - Setting: Rocky outcrop, morning mist
   - Suggested mood: **PASTORAL** - soft morning light, competent hope, relief
   
2. **Moment 02** - Thorne vs merchant princes (political menace)
   - Emotional color: "coiled restraint"
   - Setting: Formal Watch Station interior
   - Suggested mood: **OMINOUS** - silk-wrapped threats, cold institutional light

3. **Moment 03** - Thorne riding alone (internal conflict)
   - Emotional color: "weighted resolve"
   - Setting: City streets, late afternoon
   - Suggested mood: **SOMBER** - the weight of divided loyalties

4. **Moment 04** - Cidrella in workshop (innocent passion)
   - Emotional color: "focused passion"
   - Setting: Warm workshop, multiple light sources
   - Suggested mood: **INTIMATE** or **CELEBRATORY**? Actually thinking about this more - it's about innocent creative joy, warmth, but there's dramatic irony. The INTIMATE mood captures the private, warm, single-focused nature. Let me go with **INTIMATE** - workshop lamplight, warm amber tones, focused creativity
   
5. **Moment 05** - Rooftop surveillance (moral complexity)
   - Emotional color: "troubled vigilance"
   - Setting: Dusk rooftop, watching below
   - Suggested mood: **OMINOUS** - the watchers in shadow, moral inversion

6. **Moment 06** - Discovery of being watched (hunter becomes hunted)
   - Emotional color: "dawning unease"
   - Setting: Morning forest, tracking evidence
   - Suggested mood: **OMINOUS** - the realization of being watched, shifting power dynamics revealing underlying tension

I'll explore the morning forest scene with its dappled light, where peaceful surfaces mask deeper unease. The pastoral landscape becomes a deceptive backdrop for mounting psychological pressure, creating a stark contrast between serene environment and growing threat. The emotional landscape suggests vulnerability emerging within an apparently tranquil setting.

7. **Moment 07** - Veyra's defiant stance
   - Emotional color: "resolute anticipation"
   - Setting: Battlements against dramatic sunset
   - Suggested mood: **KINETIC** stillness - a charged moment of preparedness embodying quiet intensity

Mood distribution reveals strategic emotional layering. Two ominous moments anchor the chapter's "encircling threat" theme, balanced by pastoral and intimate scenes. The varied emotional palette prevents monotony while maintaining narrative tension.

Moment 06's forest setting offers nuanced potential - peaceful morning light concealing subtle unease. Pastoral mood could amplify the discovery's unsettling undertones through delicate contrast between serene environment and emerging threat.

I'll extract Cidrella's precise visual details from the analyst's draft description. Her gnomish background and distinctive prosthetic arm suggest complex technological and magical integration, creating an intriguing character profile with sharp visual markers.
