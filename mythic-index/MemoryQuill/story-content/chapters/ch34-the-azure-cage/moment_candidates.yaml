      - "She smiled brightly, a smile that was all sharp edges and dangerous promise."
      - "'The subjects—' she caught herself with practiced ease, '—I mean, the specimens would have no idea how thoroughly they're... protected.'"
      - "Her eyes locked with Mourngrave's. 'It's really quite brilliant, if I do say so myself. Though I imagine you already know exactly how well it all works, don't you, Dr. Mourngrave?'"
      - "The investors heard only pride. Mourngrave heard a declaration of war."
    
    selection_rationale: "The chapter's PIVOT moment—where the covert game becomes open warfare. The visual is powerfully distinctive: the gnome inventor's wild magic literally escaping through her weaponized arm as she throws down the gauntlet. The dual reading (investors vs. Mourngrave) creates dramatic irony. This is where everything changes."

    narrative_beat: "The Company gathers around the lamp-lit map table in the warehouse as Finn presents the wine-stained manifest with trembling hands. The horror of what they've confirmed settles over them—but Veyra's lantern seems to burn a little brighter as she declares: 'Let's get to work.'"
    subtext: "Knowledge processed into purpose. The diverse Company—warriors, healers, engineers, spies—unified by shared moral outrage. The closing visual mirrors the opening: lamp-light against darkness, but now with the clarity of knowing what they face and the resolve to act."

      character_revelation_note: "Multiple character profiles emphasize the Company as 'found family' and 'chosen family.' This moment shows them unified—each contributing their specialization to the shared horror-into-purpose transformation."
      relationship_context: "Vera's presence (recovering from earlier events) and Finn's triumphant return complete the family circle. The debrief structure reflects Thorne's documented preference for 'after-action reports.'"

    source_excerpts:
      - "Finn arrived last, slipping in through the back entrance, still smelling of kitchen grease and wine. His face was pale but triumphant, a folded paper clutched in his trembling hands."
      - "Veyra's own lantern sat at the table's edge, its flame steady despite the draft from the harbor windows—almost as if it, too, was listening."
      - "The lantern flame seemed to burn a little brighter as they bent over their maps and plans, its light steady against the darkness pressing in from outside."
      - "She looked around at her people—her family, really—gathered in the lamplight."
    
    selection_rationale: "The closing anchor that completes the chapter's visual arc—from Veyra alone at dawn's window to the Company united at night's map table. The ensemble composition showcases their diversity while the central lantern embodies their mission (light in dark places). Finn's trembling triumph connects to the opening's nervous preparation, showing growth."
