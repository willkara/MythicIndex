## Scene 1: The Rules of Engagement

Morning smelled of salt and ink. Tea cooled at elbows; the Bellringer sketch lay smudged between a brass compass and string. No one spoke of last night—the hours spent arguing over infiltration routes, the sharp words between Cid and Korrath about whose design philosophy had been more thoroughly corrupted. They spoke instead of cuffs and titles, of how to sound impressed without sounding pleased. Cid had braided her hair too tight, as if neatness could pin the current in place.

Veyra stood apart from the group, her lantern sitting on the windowsill beside her. She'd been watching the harbor since before dawn, the way light changed the water from black to grey to silver. Her mind kept circling back to the architectural plans they'd stolen, the cold precision of Korrath's layouts now transformed in her imagination into something far darker. Rooms that could be cells. Ventilation systems that could pump sedatives. A facility designed to cage children with magical abilities.

*We've planned rescues before,* she reminded herself. *The Great Library. Westwall. This is no different.*

But it was different. At Westwall, the enemy had been obvious—Black Hawks in the field, fire and steel. Here, the enemy wore silk and smiled at you while they trafficked in stolen lives.

Finn slipped in from the alley, lemon and wine on his sleeves. His young face was flushed with nervous excitement. "Kitchens hire by the hand," he said. "I can keep close. The head cook—Martha something—she's already complaining about being short-staffed for the gala. They need runners, scullery help."

Thorne's jaw tightened. He didn't like sending the boy into danger, but Finn had proven himself resourceful time and again. "It stays an extra side job, Finn. You're Company first—but scullery hears things. Let it help. If anything feels wrong—anything at all—you get out. No heroics."

Finn nodded solemnly, but his eyes were bright with the particular eagerness of youth facing its first real spy mission.

A firm rap at the door cut across the room. Thorne cracked it. The courier's leather satchel held the morning's polite business; one envelope wore azure ribbon, the seal pressed in midnight-blue wax bearing the interlocking V and A of Veridian Agronomics.

The invitation lay on the strategy table like a thrown gauntlet. Marcus Heartbridge, dressed in a tailored silk doublet of deep charcoal that seemed to drink the warehouse light, picked it up and read it aloud for the third time. His voice was smooth, but his eyes were sharp, analytical.

"'Following your remarkable success at the Great Library, Veridian Agronomics would be honored to host Commander Thornwake and guests at our annual Spring Innovation Gala. As fellow professionals dedicated to specialized excellence, we believe you would appreciate our advances in magical horticulture. The original architects of our facility, Mr. Threnx and Ms. Vexweld, will be our guests of honor.'"

From the hall, Finn cleared his throat. "Scullery took me on as an aspiring cook. I can keep to the back stairs and hear what the cellars hear."

He set the elegant parchment down with deliberate care. "This is beautiful, actually. Pure professional courtesy—the kind of invitation that gets sent to every prominent organization in Waterdeep after a public success. They _have_ to invite us. To not invite the heroes of the Great Library rescue would be a social slight that would raise more questions than our presence ever could."

Marcus began to pace, a predatory smile playing at his lips. "They don't know we suspect them. To Veridian's legitimate face, we're simply another successful organization worthy of networking with. But to the Silent Hand leadership? We're a potential problem they want to assess up close."

He looked around at the assembled team. Veyra sat with that particular stillness that preceded violence—Marcus could practically see her calculating sight lines and exit routes. Korrath's bronze scales seemed dull with the weight of his family's tarnished honor, but his architect's eye was already working, sketching invisible blueprints in the air. Cid vibrated with barely suppressed fury, her prosthetic hand occasionally sparking with tiny arcs of frustrated energy. Thorne stood like a mountain—steady, reliable, but Marcus caught the subtle way the paladin's fingers traced his holy symbol, preparing for the evening ahead. Even now, Rill was staring out the window at the harbor, completely absorbed in watching the tide patterns rather than listening to the briefing.

"This is my field of battle," Marcus stated, his tone shifting from diplomat to spymaster. "And on this field, there are rules. Rule one: we are not there as the Last Light Company investigating a criminal conspiracy. We are there as professional associates of Threnx and Vexweld, two brilliant architects being honored for their work. Our curiosity is academic, our praise is genuine, our questions are professional. We are exactly what we appear to be—until we're not."

He paced slowly. "Aldwin, you are a healer fascinated by their nutritional research. Rill, a water specialist intrigued by their purification methods. Grimjaw, you are a peer of Korrath's, interested in the structural marvels. Veyra, you are a security consultant, impressed by their safety record. We are all here to learn and admire."

His gaze fell on Lyra, who was adjusting the collar of a modest but elegant scholar's gown. "Dr. Blackwood," he said with a nod. "You are our ringer. You know the academic world. You will ask the questions no one else can, questions that are innocent to a layman but deeply problematic to an expert."

"And me?" Cid asked, her prosthetic hand clenching and unclenching at her side.

"You," Marcus said, his voice softening slightly, "are the guest of honor. You are proud, brilliant, and perhaps a little too passionate about your work. You are allowed to be... enthusiastic. Let them see the genius; hide the fury."

He turned back to the group. "Our goal is twofold. First, we gather intelligence. Finn is already inside—apprenticing in the scullery, ears open. The rest of us will engage the legitimate staff—the researchers, the cooks, the groundskeepers. These people are not our enemies; they are unwitting accomplices. We plant seeds of doubt, not accusations. Second, we secure the tour. Korrath, that falls to you. It must be a natural request, a professional courtesy they cannot refuse."

"And what if they already know?" Grimjaw rumbled.

"They know _of_ us," Marcus corrected. "They do not know that we have their blueprints. They do not know that we have their secrets. Tonight, we are simply a potential problem they wish to assess. Our job is to appear... manageable. Now, let's get dressed for the party."

## Scene 2: A Palace of Glass

The Last Light Company approached the Azure Pavilion as evening painted the harbor in shades of copper and rose. They had dressed for the occasion—not noble finery, but the respectable attire of successful professionals. Veyra wore a high-collared dress of deep forest green that concealed her burn scars while projecting quiet authority. Thorne had polished his old dress uniform until the brass buttons gleamed. Even Grimjaw had been persuaded into a formal coat, though he'd refused to surrender his worn leather belt with its various pouches and tools. "Never know when you need a good wrench," he'd muttered.

The Azure Pavilion was breathtaking at dusk, but to Thorne, the 300-foot pier leading to it was a beautifully crafted kill-zone. He felt a familiar tension in his shoulders as they walked the exposed oak planks, noting the City Watch screeners at the first lay-by niche and the chainable bollards meant to halt a cavalry charge, let alone a group of pedestrians. There was no cover. A single, perfect chokepoint. He scanned the open-air colonnade ahead, his mind automatically mapping fields of fire.

*They've designed this for defense,* he realized. *Not against us—against anyone who might want to attack during an event. But it works both ways. If this goes wrong, we're trapped on a pier with our backs to the harbor.*

He glanced at Veyra, saw the same calculation in her eyes. She gave an almost imperceptible nod. They'd already discussed contingencies—Rill could command the water if needed, provide an escape route. But it would mean blowing their cover entirely.

The white marble pavilion seemed to hold the day's last light, while the signature azure tiles of the roof deepened to the color of a twilight sky. Enchanted crystal lanterns floated in the air, casting a soft, silvery glow that shimmered on the harbor's gentle waves. The architecture was stunning—open colonnades, sweeping arches, a central dome of glass and copper that caught the sunset like a captured star. Flower arrangements worth more than most workers earned in a month stood in crystal vases, and the tables were laden with delicacies from across the Sword Coast.

The air was a clean, crisp mix of sea salt, the distant sound of harbor bells on the wind, and the faint, expensive perfumes of Waterdeep's elite. Aldwin walked beside Veyra, his healer's senses cataloguing a different kind of threat—the food, the drinks, the possibility of poisons. He'd already identified three different herbs in the flower arrangements that could be used for sedation if properly prepared.

Rill, walking beside Thorne, seemed oblivious to the tactical concerns. Her gaze was fixed downward, her head tilted as if listening to something no one else could hear. "The piles are resisting a westward swell," she murmured, more to herself than anyone else. "You can feel the vibration. There's a secondary eddy near the far side. A service float, maybe? Something heavy is being moved regularly. The water remembers the disturbance."

Thorne filed the information away. A service float meant another access point—potentially useful. Rill's unique form of reconnaissance was proving invaluable.

Korrath and Cid walked together, the bronze dragonborn and the copper-haired gnome drawing curious glances from other guests. As honored architects, they'd been given pride of place on the invitation, and now they had to play the part of brilliant professionals being celebrated for their work. The work that had been twisted into a prison.

Cid's prosthetic arm hummed faintly as she fought to contain her emotions. Korrath had gone utterly still in the way of dragonborn facing a threat too large to fight directly—a controlled calm that preceded either explosive action or calculated patience. Tonight demanded patience.

Dr. Elisande Mourngrave greeted them at the entrance, a vision of academic grace in a deep blue gown. Her smile was warm, but her eyes were like chips of ice, performing a rapid, flawless assessment of each of them.

"Commander Thornwake, what an unexpected pleasure," she said, her voice a finely tuned instrument of professional courtesy. "When we invited Mr. Threnx and Ms. Vexweld, we didn't realize they'd bring such distinguished colleagues."

"Korrath and Cid have done excellent work for us recently," Veyra replied, her tone equally placid. "We wanted to support them at their moment of recognition."

"Of course," Mourngrave said, her gaze lingering for a fraction of a second too long on Veyra's scarred cheek. "Excellence should always be celebrated."

Marcus stepped forward smoothly, taking Mourngrave's hand and bowing with practiced charm. "Dr. Mourngrave, Marcus Heartbridge. On behalf of my associates, thank you for this generous invitation. Your facility's reputation for innovation is the talk of the Trades Ward."

It was the opening move in a game where every word was a piece on the board, and Marcus had just placed his first bishop.

As they moved deeper into the pavilion, Rill drifted toward the harbor balustrade. Her brow furrowed. There, clinging to the foundation piles, was a subtle, oily shimmer, and the faint but unmistakable chemical scent of an unnatural poison cutting through the salt air. It was an affront.

Finding a secluded spot, she knelt, her hand hovering just above the water. With a quiet focus, she coaxed the slick away from the stone, herding the viscous pollutant into a single, dark globule that pulsed with a sick iridescence. A small school of silver fish, which had been darting away from the poison, immediately swam back into the shelter of the pier. Rill contained the globule in a small, empty vial from her belt, her duty done.

"Speaker Vossari. A word?"

Rill turned. A human man with the weathered face and calloused hands of a ship's captain stood there, his expression one of deep respect. He gestured with his chin toward the now-clean water.

"The harbor thanks you," he said quietly. "Not many of the high-and-mighty folk who party here would notice when the water is sick. It's good to know the Speaker of the Tidal Courts still does."

"The water should be clean," Rill replied simply, her voice as calm and steady as the deep sea. "It's my duty to see to it."

The captain gave a short, deferential bow and melted back into the crowd, leaving Rill to her quiet communion with the now-healing water.

Thorne, however, felt something entirely different. As he moved through the elegantly dressed crowd, a familiar chill ran up his spine—that crawling sensation he'd learned to recognize over years of fighting the darkness. Several of the servers moved with the wrong kind of purpose, their smiles too practiced, their eyes too watchful. When one passed close by carrying a tray of wine, the paladin's hand instinctively moved toward his holy symbol. Something was profoundly wrong with this place, woven into its very foundations despite the beautiful facade.

"Commander," he said quietly to Veyra, his voice barely above a murmur. "We're not among friends here. Some of these people... there's something off about them."

"I know," she replied just as softly. "Stay alert, but stay in character."

As if to punctuate her words, Thorne felt it—not a chill, but a sudden, sickening lurch in his soul, like the feeling of a missed step in the dark. It was the taste of ash and old blood, a spiritual stench his oath had trained him to recognize. It was gone as quickly as it came, but it was potent. He looked at the server who had just passed—a young, unremarkable man—and then at Dr. Mourngrave across the room. The feeling hadn't come from her. It had come from the server. His brow furrowed. The board was more complicated than they'd assumed.

## Scene 3: A Symphony of Whispers

The party was a symphony of layered deception, and Marcus was its conductor. He moved through the crowd with the ease of a man born to it, a glass of wine in one hand, extracting information with the other. He learned from a disgruntled investor that Veridian had yet to turn a profit, surviving on "generous research grants." He heard from a rival academic that Dr. Mourngrave's published work was notoriously vague on practical results.

It was then, as he feigned interest in a discussion on shipping insurance, that he caught it. The fragments of a hushed conversation from two well-dressed merchants standing near a marble column. "...the yields are still theoretical," one complained. The other, a man Marcus recognized from the West-Gate Shipping Guild, lowered his voice. "Patience. The Shepherd has assured us the next phase will be extremely profitable. The new 'acquisitions' are arriving this week." Marcus's charming smile didn't waver, but inside, a crucial piece of the puzzle clicked into place. The name, spoken here, was the confirmation he needed.

He guided his team with subtle signals. A slight tip of his glass sent Aldwin toward the catering tables. A brief touch to his cufflink directed Grimjaw toward a group of off-duty guards. The timing was perfect—almost unnaturally so—as if the universe itself was conspiring to put the right people in the right places at precisely the right moments.

Cid, meanwhile, had ignored all social cues and was staring intently at one of the floating crystal lanterns. "Photomancy regulated by harmonic resonance," she muttered, her fingers twitching. "But how are they grounding the energy fluctuations?" Forgetting herself for a moment, she made a subtle gesture. A spectral, glowing blue hand—her Mage Hand—drifted up toward the lantern's casing. Suddenly, the crystal flickered violently. A nearby guard glanced up. Cid snatched her hand back, the spectral appendage vanishing instantly. The guard stared at the lantern for a long moment before shrugging and turning away. Cid let out a breath she didn't realize she was holding, her heart racing with the thrill of a near-discovery.

Aldwin, with his gentle demeanor, found Martha Hearthwarm beaming with pride. "The young folks in our apprentice program just love the meals I prepare," she said. "Though they do seem so tired lately—Dr. Mourngrave says it's the intensive study schedule."

"Fascinating," Aldwin said, his voice full of warmth. "I specialize in holistic healing. Nutrition for young, developing minds is a passion of mine. What sort of diet does the program require?"

As Martha happily detailed the nutrient-rich, calorie-dense meals, Aldwin's heart grew heavier. It was the diet of prisoners being kept healthy for transport, not of students. He listened with a kind smile, his eyes full of a sorrow Martha couldn't comprehend.

Meanwhile, Grimjaw had discovered that the Pavilion's wine selection included a respectable dwarven ale. What started as professional camaraderie with the guards quickly devolved into an impromptu drinking contest.

"Night shift at a bloody greenhouse," one guard grumbled, his third mug making him loose-tongued. "Could be worse, I suppose. At least it pays well."

"Aye," Grimjaw said, matching him drink for drink with practiced ease. "Good pay for good security. Must be valuable plants."

"That's what they tell us," the guard slurred, clearly losing the contest. "Though the rounds in the service undercroft are creepy as hell. It's just a crawlspace, but you hear things. Weird thrumming sounds. Probably the cooling systems for the labs they mentioned. Or... or maybe it's the apprentices having nightmares again."

The guard's companion elbowed him sharply, but the damage was done. "Shut it, Tomm. You've had too much."

Grimjaw slammed his now-empty mug on the table, the sound echoing like a hammer strike. "Too much? Bah! You humans call this drinking?" he roared, grabbing the swaying guard in a friendly headlock. "You haven't drunk 'til you've sung the song of my clan!" Before anyone could object, he launched into a thunderous, off-key ballad about digging for gold and fighting giant badgers. The sheer volume turned heads across the pavilion. To Marcus's visible dismay, the other guards, deep in their cups, tried to join the chorus, creating a pocket of glorious, dwarven chaos that provided the perfect cover for the rest of the team's operations.

Finn saw his chance near the service hoist connecting the main floor to the leeward float below. A Veridian administrator had left a satchel of documents on a staging crate while arguing with a porter. Heart hammering, Finn grabbed a bottle of wine from a passing tray and lurched forward, feigning a stumble. Wine sloshed over the crate, soaking a sheaf of papers. "Oh, gods, terribly sorry!" he yelped, his voice cracking. He grabbed a rag, hands trembling as he dabbed at the mess, his eyes darting across the page. _Shipping manifests... Live Cargo... Special Handling Requirements... Night-tide transfer._ The administrator was too busy yelling at the porter to notice the clumsy boy's frantic scanning. Finn mumbled another apology and scrambled away, his legs unsteady. It was a mess, but he'd done it. He caught Marcus's eye across the pavilion and gave the slightest, terrified nod. Information acquired.

Nearby, Korrath had wandered to one of the pavilion's elegant marble columns, running his scaled fingers along the carved surface with professional interest. To any observer, he was simply an architect admiring fine craftsmanship. But his trained eye saw what others missed: stress fractures that shouldn't exist in marble this new, inconsistent wear patterns that suggested heavy, regular traffic in areas that should be purely decorative.

"Beautiful work," he said to a passing Veridian administrator. "Though I'm curious about the foundation work. The settlement patterns here suggest some interesting engineering choices."

The administrator beamed with pride. "Oh yes, Dr. Mourngrave insisted on extensive basement facilities. Climate-controlled storage, research laboratories, staff quarters for our residential apprentice program. Quite impressive, really."

Korrath nodded appreciatively, his mind racing. He ran a hand over a column. Marble-clad timber cores, just as the public record stated. But the stress fractures weren't just in the cosmetic marble. He could feel a deep groaning in the timber itself. _This isn't from storage rooms or laboratories,_ he thought, a cold dread settling in his gut. _This is the result of repeated, heavy, dynamic loads. This is the signature of heavy, reinforced cell doors slamming shut. Over and over._ His own designs, twisted to cage people. The dishonor of it was a physical weight.

## Scene 4: The Test and The Tell

The evening had reached that particular hour when the first wave of guests began to drift away and those who remained grew either bolder or more careless with their words. The crystal lanterns floated lower now, as if the magic that sustained them was growing tired, and the musicians had shifted from lively dance music to something more contemplative.

Lyra, as the elegant Dr. Blackwood, was discussing magical hybridization with a genuine botanist—a nervous young woman named Tessara who seemed genuinely passionate about cultivating resilient crop strains. The conversation was fascinating in its own right; Lyra found herself wishing she could simply enjoy the academic discourse without searching every word for hidden meaning.

Then Sergeant Dalton Crowsight made his approach. He was a predator in a party doublet, his movements too precise, his smile showing too many teeth.

"Dr. Blackwood, wasn't it?" he said with a smile that didn't touch his cold eyes. "From Baldur's Gate? Funny, I had a cousin who worked at the Arcane Collegium there. Professor Thaddeus Marwick—taught transmutation. Perhaps you know him?"

Lyra gave a light, academic laugh, a perfect blend of surprise and professional courtesy. "Marwick? No, can't say I've had the pleasure. I work primarily with the botanical research wing—we're rather isolated from the transmutation department. Though I did attend a lecture by Professor Elminster Caufield on organic transmutation last spring. Fascinating work on accelerated growth patterns."

She had not only deflected, she had built a more credible fiction than his. Crowsight was momentarily flustered, his carefully planned test completely derailed by her quick thinking. "Ah... Caufield. Yes, I've... heard the name."

"You must tell your cousin to attend his next symposium," Lyra pressed, her smile unwavering. "Revolutionary applications for agricultural enhancement. In fact, that's why I'm so interested in Veridian's work here."

She had not just passed the test—she had turned it inside out and made him the one answering questions. Crowsight knew when he'd been beaten at his own game. He offered a curt nod and retreated, unsettled by the realization that he'd been outmaneuvered by someone who might not be who she claimed to be.

Later, the moment of truth arrived. Dr. Mourngrave approached Cid, a small group of investors in tow. "Ms. Vexweld, these gentlemen were just asking about the remarkable containment properties of your atmospheric regulation system. Such perfect... isolation."

Cid's prosthetic hand, holding a wine glass, sparked once—a tiny, blue-white arc of barely contained energy, like her fury was literally trying to escape through her fingertips. She smiled brightly, a smile that was all sharp edges and dangerous promise. "Oh, absolutely! The systems are remarkably versatile. Perfect containment. Nothing gets in... _nothing gets out._"

She paused, letting the words hang in the air. "The beauty is in the redundancies. Every fail-safe has a fail-safe. You could keep absolutely _anything_ inside those chambers. For as long as you wanted. The subjects—" she caught herself with practiced ease, "—I mean, the _specimens_ would have no idea how thoroughly they're... protected. From contamination, of course."

Her eyes locked with Mourngrave's. "It's really quite brilliant, if I do say so myself. Though I imagine you already know exactly how well it all works, don't you, Dr. Mourngrave?"

The investors heard only pride. Mourngrave heard a declaration of war.

## Scene 5: The Interception

From the shadows of the colonnade, Veyra watched the exchange between Cid and Mourngrave with growing unease. The gnome inventor had walked a dangerous line—close enough to accusation that Mourngrave couldn't possibly have missed the implication, yet technically still within the bounds of professional pride. It was brilliant, in its way, but it had drawn unwanted attention.

Captain Thale Greycloak, Veridian's Head of Security, had seen the spark from Cid's hand and the sudden, glacial stillness in Mourngrave's posture. He moved with the quiet purpose of a wolf cutting a sheep from the flock—his target wasn't Cid, Veyra realized with alarm, but one of the investors who had witnessed the exchange. A Lord Thann, according to Marcus's earlier briefing. Someone who had heard too much and might start asking the wrong questions.

"Lord Thann," Greycloak said to one of the investors, his voice a polite murmur. "Dr. Mourngrave asked if you would join her for a private consultation regarding your... investment security. This way, please."

He began to guide the portly, confused noble toward a secluded colonnade. But before they had taken three steps, a charming voice cut in.

"Lord Thann! Just the man I was hoping to see." Marcus Heartbridge stepped smoothly from behind a fluted marble column, his smile effortless. He had been using the pavilion's 'column forest' to track Greycloak's movements, anticipating this very move. "I was just discussing the shipping tariffs on Cormyrian silk with Lady Blackmere, and she mentioned you were the city's foremost expert."

Thann puffed up with pride. "Well, I do have some experience..."

"My apologies, Captain," Marcus said to Greycloak, not sounding apologetic at all. "But a matter of civic commerce surely takes precedence over internal security, wouldn't you agree? Lord Thann's wisdom is a city-wide asset."

Greycloak was trapped. To insist would cause a scene and reveal his true purpose. He was forced to release the noble's arm. "Of course," he said, his eyes locking with Marcus's. "Another time, my lord."

Marcus smoothly guided Lord Thann away, leaving Greycloak standing alone. The timing had been absolutely flawless—as if Marcus had somehow known exactly when Greycloak would make his move, exactly what words would stop him, exactly how to turn the captain's own professionalism against him. It was the kind of perfect execution that left opponents wondering if they'd been outplayed or simply unlucky.

A message had been sent: _You are not the only players on this board. And your pieces can be taken._

## Scene 6: The Board is Set

As the gala wound down, Dr. Mourngrave approached the Last Light Company's contingent, her composure perfectly restored. She was flanked by Captain Greycloak, his face an unreadable mask.

"Thank you all for attending," she said, her voice once again the epitome of professional grace. "Mr. Threnx, Ms. Vexweld—shall we say next week for that facility tour? I'm sure Commander Thornwake would find our security measures... instructive."

It was no longer an invitation; it was a challenge.

Veyra felt the familiar heat rise in her chest—the battle fury that had served her so well in combat, demanding action, demanding she reach for the weapons at her side and end this charade here and now. But years of command discipline held firm. She forced her breathing to remain steady, her posture to stay relaxed, her scarred hands to remain visible and empty.

"We're always eager to learn about successful operations," she replied, her gaze steady and voice completely controlled. "Especially ones that protect valuable assets."

The double meaning hung in the cool salt air. The game had been joined. The tour was no longer an opportunity; it was a trap they had to walk into, and their opponents now knew they were coming.

## Scene 7: What the Shadows Told

The warehouse was quiet when they returned, the harbor sounds muffled by thick walls and the late hour. Vera waited for them in the main hall, Echo perched on a rafter above—she'd been too weak to attend the gala, but her eyes were sharp with questions as they filed in, shedding their formal wear like snakes shedding too-tight skins.

Finn arrived last, slipping in through the back entrance, still smelling of kitchen grease and wine. His face was pale but triumphant, a folded paper clutched in his trembling hands.

"Everyone," Veyra said, her voice cutting through the murmured conversations. "Report."

They gathered around the map table, the lantern light casting long shadows across their faces. Veyra's own lantern sat at the table's edge, its flame steady despite the draft from the harbor windows—almost as if it, too, was listening.

Marcus went first, his usual polish replaced by the focused intensity of a spymaster assembling pieces of a puzzle. "I confirmed the connection we suspected. The name 'The Shepherd' was mentioned by two separate merchants in reference to Silent Hand operations. More importantly, I overheard a reference to 'new acquisitions arriving this week' and 'extremely profitable' returns. They're moving soon."

"The guards talked too," Grimjaw added, his voice a low rumble. "After enough ale, one of them mentioned sounds from the 'undercroft'—what he called 'nightmares' from the 'apprentices.' And the way he said it, he knows those aren't apprentices. He just doesn't want to think about what they really are."

Aldwin's gentle face had gone hard. "I spoke with Martha Hearthwarm, the head cook. She's not involved—I'd stake my life on it. But she described the meals she prepares for the 'residential program.' High-protein, high-calorie, carefully balanced nutrition. Exactly what you'd feed prisoners you wanted to keep healthy for transport."

"The structural evidence confirms it," Korrath said, his voice heavy with shame. "The wear patterns I observed are consistent with heavy, reinforced doors opening and closing repeatedly. The building loads suggest the basement facilities are far more extensive than the official records show. And the vibrations Rill detected..." He looked at the water genasi.

"Something moves beneath that pavilion regularly," Rill said quietly. "The water tells me of disturbances, of things being lowered into boats at night. The harbor remembers the weight of cargo that shouldn't exist."

Lyra leaned forward, her scholar's disguise discarded but her sharp intelligence fully engaged. "Crowsight tested me—tried to trip up my cover story. He's suspicious, but he doesn't know for certain. More importantly, I had time to observe the security rotation. There are gaps—brief ones—between patrol circuits. And the servers..." She paused, exchanging a glance with Thorne.

"Some of those servers aren't human," Thorne said grimly. "Or weren't always. My oath lets me sense corruption, and several of them radiated something... wrong. Not undead, but something else. Like they'd been touched by dark magic and come away changed."

"Mind-controlled?" Aldwin asked, his healer's concern evident.

"Possibly. Or something worse." Thorne's jaw tightened. "The Silent Hand isn't just trafficking children. They have resources we haven't fully mapped yet."

Cid had been silent throughout the reports, her prosthetic arm crackling with occasional sparks of frustrated energy. Now she spoke, her voice tight with barely controlled fury. "My systems. They're using MY systems to keep those children trapped. I designed the atmospheric regulation—the ventilation, the pressure controls. I made them perfect because I believed I was helping people. And they're using my perfection to keep victims sedated and compliant."

Korrath placed a massive, scaled hand on her small shoulder. "Our dishonor is shared, Cidrella. But so will our redemption be."

"What about Mourngrave herself?" Vera asked from her seat by the window, her voice still rough from her recovery. "Is she the leader, or just another piece on the board?"

Marcus considered the question carefully. "She's highly placed, certainly. But the way Greycloak deferred to her authority while simultaneously acting on his own initiative suggests a parallel command structure. She may control the legitimate face of Veridian, while Greycloak manages the... other operations. And neither of them may be 'The Shepherd' we keep hearing about."

"Finn?" Veyra turned to the young man, who was still clutching his paper. "What did you find?"

Finn's hands shook as he unfolded the document. "I... I spilled wine on some papers near the service hoist. The administrator was yelling at a porter, didn't notice me reading while I pretended to clean. It's a shipping manifest, Commander. 'Live cargo—special handling requirements—night-tide transfer.' And a date." He looked up, his young face pale but determined. "Three days from now."

The silence that followed was absolute. Three days. They had three days before the next transport of trafficked children.

"The tour Mourngrave offered," Veyra said slowly, thinking aloud. "It's in five days. After the transfer."

"She's daring us to come see an empty facility," Marcus said, understanding dawning. "By the time we get our 'tour,' anyone currently held there will be long gone. All we'll see is perfectly legitimate agricultural research."

"Then we don't wait for the tour." Veyra's voice had taken on the edge of command, the same tone she'd used at Westwall when everything was falling apart and they needed a way forward. "We go in before the transfer."

"That's two nights from now, at the latest," Thorne said. "Not much time to plan an infiltration of a heavily guarded facility."

"We have the blueprints," Korrath said, his voice finding new strength. "I designed the security systems—I know their weaknesses."

"And we have the Bellringer," Cid added, her eyes gleaming with fierce purpose. "The counter-harmonic to neutralize the sedation systems. It's not tested, but it should work."

"Rill can get us in through the water access," Vera said, then paused. "But I can't come with you. Not yet. I'm still too weak."

"You've done enough," Veyra said firmly. "Your intelligence helped us get this far. Now rest. Heal. We'll need you for what comes after."

She looked around at her people—her family, really—gathered in the lamplight. Warriors and healers, spies and engineers, all united by a single purpose. *No one left behind.* The words of her oath echoed in her mind, joined now by a new imperative.

"We have two days to plan the most important rescue the Last Light Company has ever attempted," she said. "Children are counting on us, whether they know it or not. So let's get to work."

The lantern flame seemed to burn a little brighter as they bent over their maps and plans, its light steady against the darkness pressing in from outside. Somewhere beneath the Azure Pavilion, prisoners waited for a rescue they couldn't imagine was coming.

The Last Light Company would bring it to them anyway.
