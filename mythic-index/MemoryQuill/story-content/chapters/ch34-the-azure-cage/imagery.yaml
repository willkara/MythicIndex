      Cid stands among elegantly dressed investors in the Azure Pavilion's central nave,
      crystal lanterns floating overhead casting silver-blue light. Her prosthetic left
      arm holds a wine glass, a tiny blue-white arc of electricity sparking between
      brass joints—the only visible crack in her professional facade. Her copper-red
      hair with blue streak is braided tight, freckled face composed but eyes blazing
      with barely contained fury. Across from her, Dr. Mourngrave in deep blue gown
      receives the challenge, her warm smile frozen as she recognizes the declaration.
      Between them, oblivious investors in fine silks, hearing only professional pride
