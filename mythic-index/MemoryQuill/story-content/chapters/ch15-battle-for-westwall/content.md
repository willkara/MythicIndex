The morning after Vera's calling brought a deceptive normalcy to Westwall Watchpost. If not for the systematic transformation of every entrance into a killing field, one might have mistaken it for any other day. But there was nothing normal about the way Grimjaw moved through the courtyard, his practiced eye cataloging weaknesses with the weight of someone who'd seen too many walls fall.

"Not there," he rumbled at two City Watch soldiers struggling to position a barrel of oil. "Corner placement's a young soldier's mistake. When the gate falls—and gates always fall—you want the oil here." He pointed to a seemingly random spot fifteen feet from the entrance. "Trust someone who's watched three different fortresses burn. Fire flows like water. You control where it starts, you control where it goes."

The soldiers exchanged glances but moved the barrel without question. There was something in the dwarf's tone—not arrogance, but the absolute certainty that came from decades of hard-won knowledge.

Thorne's patrol worked as a unit nearby, checking weapons with the smooth efficiency of veterans. These were the same soldiers who'd found Veyra in that canyon, who'd carried the bodies of the Gilded Compass back to Waterdeep. They moved with practiced coordination, needing few words.

Sergeant Kelen supervised the weapon maintenance with his typical thoroughness, his scarred hands checking every buckle and strap twice. "Right then," he said to Corporal Darric, who was examining her shield with dwarven meticulousness. "Make sure that strap's secure. Last thing you need is it failing mid-swing."

"Shield's held through worse than this," Darric replied with typical dwarven understatement, tapping the proudly dented metal.

Archer Venn tested her bowstring with a practiced pull, her perpetually smug grin not quite reaching her eyes. "Like old times, eh Captain? Remember the Dock Ward uprising?"

"This is different," Thorne replied, watching Quartermaster Fayne count arrows while muttering numbers under their breath—already calculating supply consumption rates. "This time we know they're coming."

His patrol—the four companions who'd been with him since before Undershade Canyon—nodded with dark humor. They'd held against riots, monster incursions, and worse. They'd hold today.

Lieutenant Tomaq supervised the integration of forces with military precision. The ten City Watch reinforcements under Sergeant Kass were distributed along the walls, mixed with the Watchpost's regular guards to ensure experience was spread evenly. No section would fall to green troops breaking.

"Hayes, Mill, Carrick," Tomaq called to the three soldiers who'd returned wounded with Vera. "You're off the line."

Corporal Hayes touched the bandaged arrow wound in his shoulder. "With respect, Sir, I can still hold a spear."

"And when that shoulder fails mid-swing?" Tomaq's one good eye fixed on him. "You'll do more good helping Brother Aldwin with the wounded. That's an order."

Hayes looked ready to argue, but Private Mill put a hand on his shoulder. The head wound might have been superficial, but Mill understood—they'd be more liability than asset in their condition.

Only Trooper Carrick seemed relieved, his hand pressed to the bandages around his ribs.

Aldwin had transformed the old barracks into a medical station, with Halden's help. The two healers worked with quiet efficiency, laying out supplies with the care of those who knew they'd soon be needed.

"Bandages here, tourniquets there," Aldwin directed, his usual gentle demeanor replaced with clinical precision. "And Halden—the black bag stays with me. Border Wars medicine isn't pretty, but it works when pretty fails."

Young Finn helped where he could, carrying supplies and trying not to look nervous. This would be his first real battle—the skirmishes he'd seen as a ranger pale compared to what was coming.

"Scared?" Vera asked quietly, appearing beside him with Echo on her shoulder.

"Terrified," Finn admitted.

"Good. Means you're not stupid." She checked her bow, every movement economical. "Stay near the walls. High ground saves more lives than courage."

In the kitchen, Mistress Elba worked with grim determination, preparing not elaborate meals but simple, high-energy food that could be eaten quickly. "Fed soldiers fight better than hungry heroes," she muttered, packaging dried meat and hard bread into portions.

Even the Watchpost's semi-feral cats seemed to sense the tension, abandoning their usual sunny spots to hide in deep shadows.

As the sun reached its zenith, Grimjaw stood atop the main gate, studying the horizon with eyes that had evaluated too many battlefields.

"What do you see?" Veyra asked, climbing up beside him.

"Patterns," he replied. "Thirty years in the Shields taught me that attacks are like avalanches—they follow the path of least resistance. Your enemy out there, they'll see our gate as weakness. They're wrong."

"Because of your reinforcements?"

Grimjaw snorted. "Reinforcements help, but that's not it. It's the approach. See how the road curves before the gate? Forces them to bunch up. Makes them perfect targets for..." He gestured to where his improvised ballistae waited, constructed from lumber and rope with ingenious simplicity. "Used the same principle in the Spine of the World. Orcs learned the hard way that dwarven engineering doesn't need to be pretty to be effective."

Below them, Thorne's patrol ran through formation drills—not for practice, they didn't need it, but to show the younger soldiers what coordination looked like.

"Mobile reserve," Thorne explained to Sergeant Kass. "We don't hold any single position. We go where the line bends."

"And if it breaks?" Kass asked.

"Then we become the line," one of Thorne's veterans answered. "Done it before. Will do it again."

They gathered in the mess hall as shadows lengthened—not for a feast, but for something more important. Simple fare shared among those who might not see another sunset.

Veyra stood, raising a simple cup of water. "I'm not good at speeches," she began, which drew a few chuckles. "But I know this—tomorrow, they expect to fight the Last Light Company. A handful of idealists playing hero." Her scarred face swept across the assembled faces. "They're wrong. Tomorrow they face something stronger. They face a family defending its home."

"Here, here!" Grimjaw boomed, raising his own cup. "I've stood in shield walls from Mithral Hall to Baldur's Gate. Never stood with finer."

The toast rippled through the room, voices joining together. Even Tomaq's usually stern face showed something approaching warmth.

Vera sat slightly apart, her amber eyes already holding something wolf-like as she communed with the approaching packs. Through the window, those with sharp ears could hear distant howling—not threatening, but acknowledging. The wild had heard the call.

Mistress Elba moved through the room with her usual efficiency, but she paused at each table, touching shoulders, offering quiet words. These weren't just soldiers to her—they were her boys and girls, even the grizzled veterans.

"Eat up, young Finn," she said, pushing an extra portion toward the young ranger. "Heroes need their strength."

"I'm not a hero, Mistress Elba," Finn protested.

"Not yet," she replied with a knowing smile. "But tomorrow has a way of changing that."

The watches were set as darkness fell, rotating through the night to ensure fresh eyes at all times. Grimjaw took first watch, his darkvision making him ideal for the deep night hours.

"Sixty years of nights like this," he mused to Aldwin, who'd come to check on him. "You'd think they'd get easier."

"Do they?" Aldwin asked.

"No. You just get better at pretending they do." The dwarf adjusted his armor, a patchwork of repairs from dozens of battles. "Your healing tent ready?"

"As ready as it can be. Halden knows the protocols. We'll save who we can."

"And those you can't?"

Aldwin's face was serene in the moonlight. "Then I'll make their passing gentle. It's all any of us can ask for."

Thorne's patrol took second watch, spreading out along the walls with the ease of long practice. They spoke in low voices, sharing memories of other nights, other battles.

"Remember the wyvern attack?" Venn asked, her usual humor subdued but present.

"Remember?" Darric laughed softly, a sound like stones grinding. "Still have the scars. Bloody thing nearly took my arm."

Sergeant Kelen checked the watch positions with methodical precision. "We held then because we watched each other's backs."

"Pattern suggests we'll hold again," Fayne added quietly, their eyes tracking movements in the darkness that formed patterns only they could see. "Same team, better prepared."

"We held then," Thorne said quietly. "We'll hold now."

Vera took the final watch with Echo, the one that would blend into dawn. She stood atop the eastern tower, her enhanced senses already picking up what others couldn't—the distant sound of armor, the smell of oil and steel carried on the wind.

The wolves were closer now. She could feel them moving through the darkness, taking positions in the forest. They wouldn't enter the Watchpost—that was human territory—but they would guard the approaches, turning the enemy's flanking attempts into killing grounds.

As the eastern sky began to lighten, almost imperceptibly at first, Echo stirred on her shoulder. The raven's head cocked, listening to something beyond human hearing.

Vera's eyes shifted from hazel to amber in the pre-dawn darkness.

"They're coming," she whispered.

Echo's cry shattered the pre-dawn quiet like breaking glass. Not her usual intelligent call, but the harsh, primal alarm of a raven who'd spotted death approaching.

Vera was already moving, her bow in hand as she raced along the parapet. "INCOMING! EASTERN APPROACH! ALL POSITIONS!"

The Watchpost erupted into controlled chaos. These weren't green soldiers scrambling in panic—these were veterans who'd drilled this moment. Feet pounded on stone as defenders rushed to their assigned positions, weapons singing as they cleared sheaths.

Grimjaw reached the eastern wall first, his decades of experience letting him move through the fortress with an efficiency younger soldiers couldn't match. One look at the approaching force and his face went grim.

"Shields up! SHIELDS UP NOW!" His voice carried the authority of someone who'd seen what happened when you were a second too slow.

The order saved lives. Arrows darkened the dawn sky moments later, a whistling rain of death that clattered against hastily raised shields and sparked off stone. One younger Watchman who'd been slow to react screamed as a shaft took him in the thigh, dropping him to the walkway.

"Halden!" Aldwin's voice cut through the chaos. He was already moving with his medical kit, but his assistant was faster, dragging the wounded soldier to cover while arrows continued to fall.

Thorne's patrol moved as a single unit, shields locked in a portable wall as they took position at the main gate. No orders needed—they'd done this dance before.

"How many?" Thorne called up to Vera.

"Fifty at least! Three columns!" Vera's enhanced vision pierced the dim light. "They're not rushing—this is organized!"

Tomaq's voice boomed across the courtyard: "CITY WATCH! DEFENSIVE POSITIONS! REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING!"

The ten reinforcements under Sergeant Kass spread along the walls with practiced precision, integrating with the regular Watchpost guards. Corporal Hayes, despite his wounded shoulder, had ignored orders and grabbed a crossbow with his good arm, taking position at a arrow slit.

The first assault came exactly as Grimjaw had predicted—a probing thrust at the main gate, testing their defenses.

"Hold!" Tomaq commanded as twenty mercenaries approached with a crude battering ram. "Let them come!"

Grimjaw watched from above, counting under his breath. "Wait for it... wait..."

The attackers reached the curve in the road he'd identified earlier, bunching up exactly as predicted.

"NOW!"

His improvised ballistae released with a sound like breaking timber. The massive bolt, crafted from a whole tree trunk, smashed into the clustered mercenaries with devastating effect. Bodies flew, the ram dropped, and the survivors scrambled for cover.

"First lesson of siege warfare," Grimjaw called to the young soldiers nearby, already directing the reload. "Make them pay for every step."

But even as the first attack reeled, Vera spotted movement on the flanks. "Climbers on the north wall! They're trying to scale!"

"Patrol, with me!" Thorne barked, his unit already moving. They flowed across the courtyard like water, reaching the north wall just as grappling hooks clanged over the battlements.

The first mercenary to crest the wall met Sergeant Kelen's sword—a perfect defensive strike that sent the attacker tumbling backward with a scream. The second found Darric's shield waiting, the dwarf's low center of gravity making her an immovable obstacle.

"Just like Dock Ward!" Venn laughed grimly, her arrows finding gaps in enemy armor even at close range. "Except better armed!"

Fayne darted between the fighters, their smaller size an advantage as they spotted patterns in the attack. "Three more ladders coming—north-northwest section!" they called out, their pattern recognition invaluable in the chaos.

Young Finn, positioned on the south wall, proved his worth when he spotted another climbing attempt. But what happened next went far beyond basic archery.

The first shot took a climbing mercenary in the shoulder—not a killing blow, but precisely placed to make him lose his grip and fall, taking two others down with him. The second arrow split the rope on a grappling hook just as three men reached the halfway point, sending them tumbling into the courtyard below rather than onto the walls where they'd endanger defenders.

"Sweet Tyr's hammer," breathed the grizzled Watchpost guard beside him, watching Finn track a running enemy through the chaos below. "Boy, that's not normal shooting."

Finn's third shot was the one that made even Archer Venn pause in her own work to watch. A mercenary had managed to reach the wall and was about to strike down a wounded defender. The shot had to thread between two fighting pairs, over the head of a crouching soldier, and hit its target at an angle that would disable without risking the friendly fighter directly behind the enemy.

The arrow took the mercenary in the sword arm just as his blade began its downward arc. The weapon spun away harmlessly, and the defender lived.

"Rangers," the guard muttered with new respect, no longer calling him 'boy.' "Always said they were different. Finn, that was the cleanest tactical shooting I've seen since the Border Wars."

This was nothing like hunting deer or tracking bandits—this was war, and his first real taste of it. But his ranger training, all those hours perfecting not just accuracy but awareness, trajectory calculation, and split-second target assessment, was proving itself when it mattered most.

Finn nocked another arrow, his hands no longer shaking. The nervousness was still there, but it was controlled now, channeled into the precise focus his mentors had taught him. Each shot had a purpose beyond simply hitting the target—control the battlefield, protect his allies, use the minimum force necessary to achieve the tactical objective.

Venn's voice carried from the northern wall, pitched to carry over the battle noise: "Finn! Whatever they taught you in that ranger training, remind me to buy your instructor a drink!"

For the first time since the battle began, Finn smiled.

In the courtyard below, Mistress Elba had abandoned her kitchen, instead helping to relay ammunition to the defenders. When a mercenary's arrow shattered against the stone near her, she didn't even flinch.

"Missed me, you bastard!" she shouted, which drew a ragged cheer from nearby defenders.

As full daylight broke across the battlefield, a massive figure strode into view, and several defenders recognized him immediately.

"Krag," Veyra breathed.

The Black Hawk mercenary looked even more imposing than he had at the bridge—full plate armor, a massive two-handed sword, and an expression of cold fury. This wasn't about coin anymore. This was personal.

"LAST LIGHT COMPANY!" his voice boomed across the battlefield. "You humiliated me at Stonebridge! Today, I take your heads and your reputation!"

"Bit dramatic, isn't he?" Grimjaw muttered, but his hands were already adjusting the ballista's aim.

"He's brought friends," Vera observed. Her enhanced vision picked out the different mercenary companies' insignias. "Black Hawks, Iron Wolves, and... something else. Can't make out the third banner."

"Doesn't matter," Thorne said grimly. "They all bleed the same."

The probing attacks intensified, but with a difference now—they were coordinated, planned. When the gate was struck, climbers appeared on the walls. When Thorne's patrol rushed to one crisis, another materialized elsewhere.

"He's testing us," Tomaq realized. "Looking for patterns, weaknesses."

"Let him look," Veyra replied, her voice carrying across the defenders. "We are the Last Light! We've held against worse odds! We'll hold today!"

The cheer that went up was genuine, but Grimjaw caught Veyra's eye with a worried look. They both knew the truth—the real assault hadn't begun yet.

A brief lull fell across the battlefield as the mercenaries pulled back to regroup. The defenders used the respite to tend wounds, redistribute ammunition, and shore up defenses.

Aldwin moved along the walls with Halden, treating minor wounds before they could become major ones. The soldier who'd taken the arrow to the thigh was stable, thanks to Halden's quick work, though he wouldn't be fighting again today.

"Twelve wounded so far," Halden reported quietly. "Nothing fatal yet."

"Yet," Aldwin echoed, his healer's instincts telling him the worst was still to come.

Vera suddenly stiffened on her perch, Echo cawing urgently. "They're moving! All of them!"

The morning sun revealed the full enemy force for the first time—at least fifty mercenaries arranged in battle formation, siege equipment being brought forward, and Krag at their center like a dark beacon.

"Here they come," Grimjaw said quietly, his voice carrying the weight of every battle he'd survived. "The real fight starts now."

Thorne's patrol formed up in the courtyard, ready to respond wherever the line bent. The City Watch stood firm on the walls. The Company prepared for what might be their last stand.

As the mercenary army began its advance, a sound drifted from the forest—howling. Dozens of voices raised in an eerie chorus that made even the hardened mercenaries pause.

Vera's eyes had gone fully amber now, and when she smiled, it showed teeth that seemed just a bit too sharp. "We're not alone."

The Battle for Westwall had begun in earnest.

They came like a tide of steel and death, and the very air changed with their approach.

The morning breeze carried the acrid smell of oil smoke from their torches, mixing with the copper tang of blood already spilled and the sour stench of fear-sweat from both sides. The main force struck the gate with coordinated precision—a proper ram this time, carried by a dozen mercenaries under a reinforced roof of shields. The sound when arrows struck the protective shell was like hailstones on slate, a metallic drumming that mixed with the rhythmic chanting of the ram bearers and the screamed orders echoing across the courtyard.

"Ignore the ram bearers!" Grimjaw bellowed. "Target the second line! Make them pay for advancing!"

His experience showed—while younger soldiers wasted arrows on the protected ram team, his directed fire devastated the mercenaries behind them. Bodies fell, but more pressed forward over their dead.

The walls erupted in violence as ladder teams reached three positions simultaneously, the defenders' world suddenly filled with the scrape of wood on stone, the clang of grappling hooks, and the grunts and curses of men climbing toward death. Sweat stung the eyes of every soldier despite the cool morning air. The constant clash of steel on steel created a din so overwhelming that orders had to be screamed to be heard three feet away. This wasn't the probing attack—mercenaries swarmed up with deadly intent, their faces twisted with battle-fury and desperation.

"North wall's pressed!" someone shouted.

"South wall needs support!"

"They're at the east tower!"

Thorne made the call without hesitation. "Patrol, split! Kelen, take Venn to the north! Darric, Fayne, with me to the south!"

His patrol divided smoothly, each pair moving to reinforce the buckling positions. They hit the crisis points with practiced coordination, their long partnership showing in every movement.

On the north wall, Sergeant Kelen and Venn arrived just as young Finn was being overwhelmed. The ranger had dropped his bow, desperately fending off a mercenary with his long knife. Kelen's defensive stance drew the attacker's attention, while Venn's arrow took him in the ribs, sending him screaming off the wall.

"Stay with us, boy!" Kelen commanded, positioning himself to protect the younger soldier. "Good work. Now check your gear."

Venn helped Finn to his feet, her usual smirk replaced with genuine concern. "First real battle's always the worst. Gets easier. Well, no—you just get better at pretending it does."

At the gate, the rhythmic pounding of the ram echoed like a dying heartbeat. Each strike sent splinters flying from the reinforced wood.

"Oil!" Tomaq commanded.

"Not yet!" Grimjaw countermanded. "Trust me, Lieutenant. I've broken more sieges than you've seen winters."

Tomaq's jaw tightened, but he deferred to the dwarf's experience. Grimjaw watched the ram with an engineer's eye, counting strikes, gauging damage.

"Now!" he roared. "But not on the ram—the ground behind them!"

The oil splashed down, followed by torches. Fire erupted not on the protected ram team but on their reinforcements. Screams filled the air as the second wave found themselves trapped between advancing flames and their own retreating comrades.

"That's why you wait," Grimjaw explained to the watching soldiers. "Panic spreads faster than fire."

The forest erupted with howls that sent primitive fear through both sides. But while the defenders had expected it, the mercenaries had not.

They came from three directions—gray shadows flowing from the tree line with deadly purpose. Not attacking yet, but circling, harrying, forcing the mercenaries to split their attention.

"What in the Nine Hells—" Krag's voice carried across the battlefield.

Vera stood tall on the eastern tower, her eyes fully amber now, and gave voice to a howl that no human throat should produce. The wolves answered, their voices joining hers in a chorus that spoke of ancient pacts and territorial fury.

A mercenary company trying to flank through the forest suddenly found themselves very occupied. Screams and snarls drifted from the tree line as the wolves reminded everyone that this was their domain.

"The mad witch brought wolves!" someone shouted from the enemy ranks.

From his position behind the main assault, Krag's voice boomed across the battlefield as he spurred his warhorse forward. "Press the attack! They're just animals!" The massive mercenary leader rode closer to the walls, his presence alone steadying his rattled men. "Gold for the first to reach their courtyard! Glory for the first to bring me that Company's banner!"

But his mercenaries were rattled. Fighting men was one thing—fighting men while wolves circled like patient death is another entirely. Krag's scarred face twisted with fury as he watched his careful plans disrupted by creatures that shouldn't have been part of any civilized battle.

The battle's rhythm shifted when a section of the east wall's ancient stonework, weakened by repeated ladder attempts, began to crumble.

"Wall breach!" The cry sent ice through every defender's veins.

Mercenaries poured toward the gap like water through a broken dam. Krag saw the opportunity immediately, wheeling his warhorse around and spurring toward the breach. "NOW!" he roared, his massive sword glinting as he pointed toward the gap. "BREAK THEM! BREAK THEIR SPIRIT!" His presence at the front of the charge turned what might have been a disorganized rush into a focused spearhead. This was the crisis point—if they established a foothold inside the walls, the battle was lost.

"Patrol, to me!" Thorne's voice cut through the chaos. His scattered companions converged on the breach with practiced speed that spoke of countless drills and shared battles.

They moved like parts of a single organism. Kelen reached the breach first, his shield slamming into position just as the first mercenary tried to squeeze through the gap. The impact sent the attacker sprawling, but two more pressed behind him.

"Pattern shows they'll feint left, strike right!" Fayne called from their position, already reading the enemy's tactical flow. "Main thrust in six seconds, secondary follow-up from the north gap!"

"Shield wall, adjust right!" Kelen commanded, and they moved as one unit, the bond forged at Undershade Canyon holding firm under desperate pressure.

Darric anchored the left side of their defense, her dwarven-forged armor taking hits that would have felled lesser fighters. When a mercenary's mace shattered against her shield, she stepped forward and drove her sword up under his ribs with clinical precision. "Pass," she grunted, the dwarven battle-word that meant the position was secure.

Venn had found her elevated position on a pile of rubble, her bow singing as arrows found gaps in enemy armor. But she wasn't just shooting—she was controlling the battle's flow, each shot designed to disrupt enemy coordination. A shot to the leg brought down a ladder carrier. An arrow through a shield strap disabled a man's protection just as Kelen's strike found him.

Fayne darted between the fighters, their smaller frame an advantage as they fed information to their teammates. "Kelen, axeman on your right in three steps! Venn, archer behind the wagon at two o'clock! Thorne, spearman flanking left!"

And through it all, Thorne fought with the deadly precision that had made him a captain. His longsword moved with surgical efficiency—parrying a thrust, riposting into an exposed throat, stepping seamlessly into the next engagement. When a massive mercenary broke through Kelen's guard, Thorne was already there, his shield taking the blow while his blade found the gap in the man's armor.

But this wasn't individual heroics. When Thorne pressed forward, Kelen shifted to cover his flank without being asked. When Darric's position came under pressure, Venn's arrows cleared her opponents before she had to call for help. When Fayne spotted a weakness in the enemy line, Thorne was moving to exploit it before the words left their lips.

"Coordinated thrust, center-left!" Fayne called.

"On my mark!" Thorne responded, his patrol already moving into position. "Three... two... now!"

They struck as one—Kelen's shield bash stunning the center defender, Darric's low cut taking down another, Thorne's blade finding the gap that opened between them. The enemy line buckled, and for a moment, the breach was clear.

Years of fighting together, of trusting each other with their lives, had created something that transcended individual skill. They moved with an efficiency that amazed the watching defenders—five people who fought like they shared one mind, one purpose, one unshakeable determination to hold the line.

The fighting was brutal, close-quarters carnage where every mistake could be fatal. But Thorne's patrol didn't just survive—they dominated, their coordinated expertise turning desperate defense into controlled aggression.

Grimjaw arrived with timber and tools. "Hold them three minutes!" he shouted, already directing defenders to shore up the crumbling wall. His engineering experience turned rubble into improvised barriers, broken stone into weapons.

Veyra was there too, not commanding but fighting, her sword dark with blood as she stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the line. This wasn't the tactical commander—this was the survivor of Undershade Canyon, fighting with the fury of someone who'd lost everything once and refused to lose it again.

"We are the Last Light!" she roared. "We hold!"

The courtyard had become a medical station under fire. Aldwin and Halden worked with desperate efficiency as wounded were dragged to them. Hayes and Mill, despite their own injuries, helped where they could—Mill holding down a screaming soldier while Aldwin extracted an arrow, Hayes applying pressure to wounds with his good arm.

Trooper Carrick, too wounded to fight, had become a runner, fetching supplies and water for the healers.

The casualties mounted on both sides. Corporal Darric took a spear thrust to her side, the blade finding a gap in her dwarven-forged armor. She went down hard, blood seeping between her fingers as she pressed against the wound.

"Darric's down!" Venn shouted, immediately moving to cover her fallen comrade with suppressing fire.

Sergeant Kelen was there in seconds, dragging the dwarf to cover with practiced efficiency. "As you were, Corporal. You're not dying on my watch."

Aldwin arrived moments later, his hands already working. "Deep but not fatal," he assessed quickly. "The armor turned most of it. Halden, pressure here!"

Darric gritted her teeth, managing to growl, "Takes more than one lucky thrust to put down a shield dwarf."

No time for relief. More wounded arrived every minute.

Mistress Elba had abandoned all pretense of non-combatant status. When a mercenary broke through and charged the medical station, she met him with a kitchen cleaver to the neck. The stout dwarf stood over Aldwin's position like a mountain guardian, her apron now splattered with blood that wasn't hers, her eyes blazing with protective fury.

"No one touches my boys! By stone and steel!" she snarled.

They were losing.

Not quickly, not dramatically, but with the slow inevitability of water wearing down stone. The defenders were exhausted, ammunition running low, too many wounded to maintain the walls.

Grimjaw's engineering had held them this long, but even his experience couldn't multiply defenders or create arrows from nothing.

Thorne's patrol was battered—Darric wounded and out of the fight, Fayne exhausted from constant movement, Venn down to her last arrows, and Kelen bleeding from a dozen minor cuts. The City Watch had lost three dead and six wounded. The wolves still harried the flanks, but couldn't assault the main force directly.

Vera stood on the wall, Echo circling overhead, and saw it all with terrible clarity. They had perhaps ten minutes before the defense collapsed entirely.

Below, near the breach that Grimjaw had barely contained, she saw the crisis point developing. Krag himself was advancing with his elite guard—massive warriors in black armor, the Black Hawks' finest killers. They would hit the breach, and nothing the exhausted defenders had left could stop them.

Her eyes found Aldwin in the courtyard, still working on wounded despite the battle raging around him. Finn nearby, out of arrows, fighting with just his knife. Thorne's patrol, bloodied and battered, trying to reform for one last stand.

Her family. Her pack.

And in that moment, Vera made her choice.

Krag's elite guard hit the breach like a battering ram made of flesh and steel.

The first defender to meet them—one of Sergeant Kass's soldiers—lasted exactly three seconds. Krag's massive blade cut through armor, flesh, and bone with horrifying ease. The man fell in two pieces.

"HOLD THE LINE!" Thorne roared, but even his veterans were being pushed back by the sheer violence of the assault.

Young Finn had been separated from the main defense, pushed toward the courtyard's edge by the chaotic fighting. Out of arrows, down to just his ranger's knife, he found himself facing one of Krag's elite—a towering female orc named Serka, with twin axes and murder in her eyes.

The first axe strike shattered his knife. The second sent him sprawling, blood pouring from a gash across his ribs. Serka raised both weapons for the killing blow, and Finn saw his death reflected in the polished steel.

From the wall above, Vera saw it all with terrible clarity. The boy who'd been so afraid yesterday, who'd fought so bravely today, was about to die. And in that moment, something inside her snapped—not broke, but released. The careful control she'd maintained, the partial transformations, the measured responses—all of it fell away.

The choice was no choice at all.

Vera's scream tore across the battlefield, raw with desperation and fury, cutting through the clash of steel and cries of the dying.

What followed was not the measured transformation she'd shown before—this was magic unleashed in a moment of pure, protective rage. Her body twisted on the wall, convulsing as if struck by lightning, the change ripping through her with violent speed.

The sound of her leather armor straps snapping like whip cracks mixed with something far more disturbing—bones breaking and reforming at impossible speed. Her spine elongated in a series of wet pops that seemed to echo off the stone walls, each vertebra reshaping itself while the battle raged below.

Steel buckles groaned and snapped as her frame expanded. Her mail shirt split at the seams, metal rings scattering like coins across the parapet. The sound of tearing cloth and breaking leather joined the organic symphony of transformation.

A soldier near the wall gagged, stumbling back. "What in the Nine Hells...?"

This wasn't the controlled shifting of a druid's art—this was desperation made manifest. Her ribcage cracked and expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops, forcing her forward as her hands darkened and extended into claws that scraped furrows in the ancient stone.

The change came in violent waves. Gray-silver fur erupted across her skin as if her humanity was being torn away and replaced. Her breathing became a ragged snarl as her throat restructured, the sound mixing with the screams and battle cries below. Her eyes dilated to black pits before blazing amber, pupils elongating as her skull pushed forward with the grinding sound of living bone being reshaped.

Even as arrows whistled overhead and men died in the courtyard below, every combatant within sight froze at the sight of something that defied nature itself.

The transformation consumed her armor, her human form, her careful control—leaving something twice the size of any natural wolf crouched on the battlements. Silver-gray fur caught the smoke-filtered sunlight as the creature took its first, deep breath, steam pluming from its nostrils in the cool morning air. It raised its head, and intelligent amber eyes holding depths of human fury scanned the battlefield below with predatory precision.

Her gaze found Serka. Locked onto her. The mercenary froze, her twin axes suddenly feeling like toys. From the battlements above, the dire wolf's lips peeled back from teeth like daggers, and a horrifying, utterly unnatural smirk twisted its features. It was a look of profound, personal satisfaction. Serka had been chosen.

The howl that erupted then wasn't just a sound—it was a declaration of war and a death sentence. It cut through the noise of battle like a blade, carrying across the blood-soaked ground to the forest beyond, where wild voices answered with their own savage promise.

Then she moved.

A dire wolf in full leap is a sight that burns itself into memory. Vera launched herself from the wall—twenty feet down—and hit Finn's would-be killer like an avalanche of fur and fury.

Serka had perhaps a heartbeat to scream before massive jaws closed around her throat. The axes fell from nerveless fingers as Vera shook her prey like a terrier with a rat. The crack of a breaking neck was audible across the courtyard.

But Vera wasn't done. For three explosive minutes that shattered the enemy assault, she became a force of nature unleashed. She moved through Krag's elite guard like death itself.

These were the Black Hawks' finest, disciplined killers who reacted instantly to the new threat. "Form up! Spears!" a lieutenant roared. They locked shields and lowered their weapons, creating a bristling steel hedgehog—a textbook defense against a large beast.

It didn't matter.

Vera crashed into the shield wall with the force of a warhorse. The line buckled instantly. A spear glanced off her thick hide, another buried itself in her shoulder. The dire wolf didn't even flinch, driving forward, splintering shields and breaking the formation entirely.

Once inside their ranks, it was a slaughter. Massive paws struck with the force of hammers, claws that could rend steel armor like paper. Jaws that could crush bone snapped shut on limbs and throats with terrible precision. She tore the arm off the lieutenant who had rallied them, his screams joining the chorus of terror that had replaced battle cries.

"KILL THAT THING!" Krag roared, but his men, seeing their best tactics fail utterly, were already breaking.

The wolves from the forest, emboldened by their alpha's transformation, surged forward. Where they had harried before, now they attacked in earnest. The battlefield became a slaughter as pack hunters met scattered prey.

But even as Vera devastated the enemy ranks, those who knew her could see the cost. The transformation was eating her alive from the inside.

"She's killing herself," Aldwin breathed from the medical station. The self-taught magic, pushed too far, was burning through her life force like fire through oil.

The dire wolf stumbled, her movements desperate, less precise. The unstoppable force was beginning to falter. With a final, desperate surge, she leaped back toward the chaos at the breach, tearing into the mercenaries trying to secure a foothold.

The mercenaries saw the beast flagging. Three men abandoned their weapons and threw themselves onto her back, trying to drag her down with sheer weight. Vera thrashed, but her strength evaporated. A wave of vertigo hit her, and the world tilted.

Her legs buckled. The magical energy sustaining her massive form failed catastrophically.

With a shuddering groan, the dire wolf—and the men clinging to her—tumbled backward. They crashed into a shattered siege barricade just inside the wall, landing in a heap of rubble, splintered wood, and overturned crates right at the edge of the main breach. They vanished from sight beneath the debris.

The mercenaries let out a ragged cheer, but Krag silenced them instantly.

"Confirm the kill!" Krag roared, unwilling to leave anything to chance.

One mercenary, a brute with a heavy mace, advanced cautiously toward the debris pile. Smoke and dust hung thick in the air, obscuring the view. He prodded the rubble with his mace. "I think she's—"

He never finished the sentence.

A clawed hand—too large for a human, too distorted for the dire wolf—shot out from the darkness of the debris. It clamped onto his ankle with impossible strength. The mercenary was yanked violently off his feet, disappearing into the rubble with a choked scream.

Every soldier nearby froze. From within the debris came the sounds of a violent, brief struggle—the snapping of bone, a wet tearing sound. This was immediately followed by a horrifying series of cracks and pops, like a creature being twisted apart from the inside, culminating in a long, shuddering groan that faded into a wet rattle.

Then, stillness.

Krag watched the rubble, his expression grim. He had heard the sounds of her transformation earlier; now he heard what sounded like its violent end. The beast, mortally wounded and cornered, had lashed out in its death throes and taken one more soul with it.

"It's done," Krag stated, dismissing the threat. The immediate danger was neutralized, and the battle was at its tipping point. If they didn't press the advantage now, the defenders would rally. "Break them! For the Hawks!"

He refocused on the primary objective: shattering the defense. He spotted Thorne holding the line amidst the chaos. "Captain!" Krag bellowed, locking eyes with Thorne. "Your line breaks now!"

Krag charged. The fighting at the breach was a claustrophobic nightmare. Krag's path took him directly past the ominous pile of debris as he aimed to corner Thorne against the wall. He raised his massive sword to deliver a killing blow.

Hidden in the rubble, the transformation was failing, and it was even more violent than the initial change. Vera's body convulsed as bones broke and reformed. Silver fur receded in patches, revealing skin slick with her own blood and that of the mercenary she had just crushed. Her body was caught in a horrifying state between woman and wolf, paralyzed by the agony of the change. The groan they had heard was not her death, but the sound of her spine violently compressing back to a semi-human shape.

Through the pain, she saw Krag move past her, raising his blade.

Just as Krag's sword began its descent toward Thorne, the debris beside him exploded outward.

Krag turned at the sudden noise, alerted by the terror in Thorne's eyes. He expected an attack from the front, but the danger came from the ground at his flank.

From the rubble emerged a nightmare. Not a wolf, not a woman, but something horribly in between. On all fours, she moved with a broken, unnatural gait, her body a twisted amalgam of human limbs and lupine features. Her eyes were amber pools of pure, feral rage, her face slick with fresh blood.

She didn't stalk; she lunged from the wreckage with the desperate, primal force of a predator making its last stand.

The space was too tight for Krag to bring his massive sword around. Vera crashed into him low. Her clawed hands found his exposed sword arm, and her jaws, still unnaturally powerful, clamped down.

Armor crumpled like tin. Bones snapped like twigs. Krag's scream was high and terrible as his sword fell from a hand that would never hold one again.

Vera collapsed, the last of her strength gone, finally reverting to her fully human form as she fell unconscious to the blood-soaked stones.

Krag stared at his ruined arm, his face a mask of shock and agony. The mercenaries faltered, their leader broken, their momentum gone. But they still had the numbers. They regrouped for the final, inevitable slaughter.

That's when young Finn, bloodied but alive, stood over Vera's unconscious form with a salvaged spear. "You saved me," he said simply. "My turn."

The immediate reaction was chaos and determination mixed in equal measure.

"Circle up! Protect her!" Veyra commanded, her sword already moving to parry a mercenary's strike.

Aldwin was there in seconds, dropping to his knees beside Vera's unconscious form. "She's alive, barely. I need time—"

"You'll get it," Thorne said firmly. "Kelen, help me move her!"

Sergeant Kelen limped forward, favoring his wounded leg but still moving with purpose. "Got her legs. Darric, clear a path!"

Even wounded, the dwarf corporal raised her shield. "Still... standing..."

Grimjaw's experienced eye swept the battlefield, taking in the tactical situation with a glance. "Wall's done. See those cracks spreading? We've got minutes before it comes down completely."

Lieutenant Tomaq, blood running down the side of his face, pointed toward the central structure. "The keep. We fall back to the keep!"

"I've got six arrows left," Venn said, already moving to cover their retreat. "Make them count."

Fayne, exhausted but still analytical, watched the enemy movements. "Pattern shows they're regrouping. Ninety seconds before they rush again."

The defenders formed a fighting retreat, those still combat-capable creating a moving shield wall while the wounded were dragged toward the keep. Echo circled overhead, cawing frantically at the sight of her mistress being carried away.

Mistress Elba appeared from the smoke, her cleaver dark with blood, her apron torn but her determination intact. "Move, you sluggards! This isn't a parade!"

They reached the keep's heavy doors just as the mercenaries began their next assault.

The keep's interior was a flurry of desperate activity.

"Barricade that door! Tables, benches, anything!" Thorne commanded, already dragging a heavy oak table into position.

"Crossbeam method - spreads the impact better." Grimjaw examined the doorframe with a critical eye. He showed the younger soldiers how to properly brace the door.

Mistress Elba, despite her age and bulk, hauled furniture with surprising strength. "Been moving furniture for thirty years. Let me show you boys how it's done."

"Archers to the arrow slits. Wounded to the upper level," Tomaq ordered, his military training taking over despite his own injuries.

Aldwin looked up from where he was working on Vera. "Halden, help me get her upstairs. She needs—"

"Already on it," Halden interrupted, understanding the urgency. "Hayes, Mill, help us carry her!"

The two wounded scouts, despite their own injuries, immediately moved to help.

Young Finn hesitated, looking between the stairs and the arrow slits. "Should I take the high window?"

"Stay with me, boy," Venn said, a rare gentleness in her voice. "We'll make those last arrows count together."

For perhaps ten minutes, the keep held. The narrow stairs and murder holes that Grimjaw had identified proved their worth, forcing the mercenaries to attack in small numbers. Bodies began to pile at the entrance.

Then the smell of smoke began to drift through the keep.

Fayne, stationed at an arrow slit, started coughing. "They're using pitch and oil. Smoke's coming through every gap!"

"Wet cloths! Cover your faces!" Kelen barked, his voice muffled as he demonstrated with his own torn sleeve.

"There's water barrels in the corner - move!" Mistress Elba commanded, already organizing the distribution.

Grimjaw watched the smoke beginning to pool at the ceiling, his expression grim. "Ten minutes before this gets unbearable. Stone doesn't burn, but we still need to breathe."

Veyra, her face covered with a wet cloth, looked to Aldwin. "How's Vera?"

"The smoke will kill her if we stay. She can't fight it in this state," Aldwin replied, his healer's instincts overriding optimism.

Thorne and Tomaq exchanged glances, reaching the same conclusion. "Then we go," Thorne said.

"Agreed. Better to die fighting than choking," Tomaq added.

Venn managed a weak laugh through her improvised mask. "Always wanted to try a desperate last charge. Very heroic."

Darric, despite her wound, pushed herself to her feet. "Can still hold a shield. Put me in front."

The smoke had become unbearable, forcing the decision.

"We go on my mark. Stay tight, protect the wounded," Veyra commanded, her voice carrying the weight of command despite the desperate situation.

"Patrol, diamond formation. We punch through to the courtyard center," Thorne added, his patrol already moving into position despite their injuries.

"Just like Dock Ward, except worse," Kelen observed with grim humor.

Fayne began to speak: "Statistically, our chances are—"

"Don't want to know!" Venn interrupted quickly.

Grimjaw looked at the door, then at the group. "Time's up. Move!"

They burst from the keep in a desperate charge, smoke billowing out behind them. The mercenaries, caught off-guard by the sudden sortie, fell back initially. But they quickly recovered, surrounding the exhausted defenders in the courtyard.

"Shield wall! Now!" Thorne commanded.

"Lock shields! Nobody breaks!" Kelen echoed, his veteran presence steadying the younger soldiers.

Finn, still supporting Vera's unconscious form alongside Halden, gritted his teeth. "I've got her!"

Mistress Elba stood with her cleaver raised, her broad dwarven frame protecting the wounded. "Behind me, boys!"

"They're surrounding us. All sides," Tomaq observed, his tactical assessment bleak.

"Then we hold all sides," Veyra declared, raising her sword. "We are the Last Light!"

Darric, barely standing but still in formation, managed to growl: "Still... standing..."

"Grimjaw, help me shield Vera!" Aldwin called out, trying to protect his patient from the press of bodies.

Grimjaw moved to comply, his expression fatalistic. "Been in tighter spots. Usually had a way out though..."

Fayne, exhausted beyond measure, made one last observation: "Pattern analysis suggests... we're going to die."

"Thanks for the optimism!" Venn shot back, nocking one of her last arrows.

The mercenaries closed in, sensing victory.

They made their stand in the courtyard, a ragged circle of exhausted defenders around an unconscious woman. The remaining mercenaries, perhaps thirty of them, formed up for one final push. Krag, his right arm hanging useless, was dragged to the rear by his men, his face a mask of agony and hate.

The mercenaries charged.

The first impact nearly shattered their line. Shields cracked under the weight of desperate men seeking revenge and gold. Spears thrust and parried, steel rang against steel, and men screamed and died in the space of heartbeats.

"Hold!" Veyra shouted, her sword taking a mercenary in the throat. "HOLD THE LINE!"

They held, but barely. The second wave hit them like a hammer against an anvil, and this time shields splintered and men went down. Sergeant Kelen took a blade across his thigh but didn't give ground. Darric, wounded and exhausted, still anchored their left with dwarven stubbornness.

"They're breaking through!" someone shouted.

And they were. The shield wall bent, buckled, began to cave in three places at once. In moments, the circle around Vera would collapse entirely.

That's when the first horn sounded from the eastern hills.

"What's that?" Finn gasped, still clutching Vera protectively.

"Cavalry horns. Three positions!" Tomaq recognized the sound immediately.

"Atlock..." Thorne breathed.

"Hold the line! Help's coming!" Veyra commanded with renewed strength.

"About bloody time!" Kelen managed through gritted teeth.

Grimjaw let out a dry laugh. "Or we get lucky. That works too."

Mistress Elba, still brandishing her cleaver, called out: "Told you boys to eat breakfast! Stone's teeth, now the cavalry's here for lunch!"

The first horn sounded from the eastern hills—clear, bright, cutting through the morning air like a blade of pure hope.

Then a second horn answered from the north.

A third from the south.

Every head turned, and what they saw broke the spirit of every mercenary on the field. Cresting the eastern rise came Commander Atlock himself at the head of his personal squadron, his scarred face set in grim determination. Beside him rode Marcus Heartbridge on a borrowed horse, looking terrified but resolute.

But it was the sight of the other two squadrons that truly struck fear into enemy hearts—cavalry emerging from the forest to the north and south in perfect coordination, their formation speaking of careful planning and flawless execution.

"PER EQUITES, MORS!" Atlock's voice boomed across the battlefield, and two hundred mounted soldiers took up the cry. "THROUGH CAVALRY, DEATH!"

The charge that followed would be remembered in City Watch history as their finest tactical moment. This wasn't a simple cavalry charge—it was a perfectly coordinated envelopment.

Atlock's central squadron thundered straight for the Watchpost gates, sabers gleaming as they carved through the mercenaries directly threatening the breach. Hooves churned the blood-soaked ground, and men screamed as steel fell like silver rain.

The northern squadron swept wide, cutting off any retreat through the forest where the wolves still prowled. Their captain, a grizzled veteran named Jorik, led his men in a sweeping arc that caught fleeing mercenaries and scattered reserve forces.

The southern squadron mirrored their movement, ensuring no enemy could escape toward the road. Captain Voss, younger but no less deadly, drove his cavalry into the enemy's exposed flank with devastating precision.

Marcus, despite his clear discomfort on horseback, managed to stay in formation until they reached the courtyard. He half-fell from his saddle, looking both terrified and smugly satisfied. "I may have... expedited certain dispatches when your scouts' reports reached the Eastern Command yesterday," he said, catching his breath. "Atlock was already mobilizing, but a few well-placed concerns about the Watch's western defenses being compromised helped clarify priorities."

Caught between the anvil of the Watchpost walls and the hammer of three cavalry squadrons, the mercenary force shattered completely. Some threw down their weapons and raised their hands in surrender. Others tried to flee and were ridden down. The few who continued fighting found themselves overwhelmed and isolated.

Krag, seeing the battle lost and his reputation in ruins, was surrounded and captured by Atlock's men before he could even attempt to flee.

"It's finished," Veyra said, looking not at the defeated mercenaries, but at Vera's still form, where Aldwin was already desperately working.

"Sixty years of practice," Grimjaw observed with satisfaction, lowering his crossbow. "You develop a sense for when someone's truly beaten."

The battle was over in minutes, but the aftermath would last much longer.

Krag was captured, wounded but alive. Across the battlefield, sixteen of his mercenaries had thrown down their weapons and raised their hands in surrender. The City Watch cavalry moved with practiced efficiency, securing the prisoners while their medics immediately went to work on wounded from both sides—a professional courtesy that spoke well of Waterdeep's military discipline.

Commander Atlock himself dismounted to survey the devastation, his weathered face grim as he took in the scope of the destruction. Captain Jorik approached, removing his helmet to reveal sweat-matted gray hair.

"Sir, prisoner count: seventeen including their leader. Eight enemy dead on this side of the field, probably fifteen more in the forest where the wolves got them. The rest scattered—we'll be finding stragglers for days."

"Casualties among our forces?" Atlock asked.

"Three wounded, none serious. The Last Light Company bore the brunt of it."

"Report," Veyra said, though she was already kneeling beside Vera's still form where Aldwin worked desperately.

"She pushed too far," Aldwin said without looking up, his hands moving with practiced efficiency despite the chaos around them. "The transformation almost killed her. Maybe has killed her. I don't—I can't—"

"You can," Veyra said firmly. "You will. That's an order."

As Aldwin worked, Commander Atlock surveyed the battlefield. Bodies everywhere, the walls breached in multiple places, the gate hanging off its hinges, fires still burning in two buildings.

"You held," he said simply. "Against impossible odds, you held."

"We're the Last Light Company," Thorne said, exhausted beyond measure. "It's what we do."

Marcus cleared his throat. "Commander, about that intelligence I mentioned—"

"Later," Atlock said. "First, we tend our wounded. Then we bury our dead. Then..." He looked at the destroyed Watchpost. "Then we discuss your future. Because you clearly can't stay here anymore."

The sun climbed higher, illuminating a battlefield that would need days to clear. What had been a place of desperate violence was now transformed into something resembling an open-air hospital and refugee camp.

City Watch medics worked alongside Aldwin and Halden, creating an efficient triage system in the courtyard. The cavalry had brought additional medical supplies, and the wounded from both sides were being treated with professional care. The sight of enemy prisoners receiving the same medical attention as defenders spoke well of Waterdeep's discipline.

The final tally was sobering: The Last Light Company and allies had lost eight dead, including three of the City Watch reinforcements and five Watchpost guards. Fifteen more were seriously wounded, including Corporal Darric from Thorne's patrol, with Vera's survival still uncertain.

Among the mercenaries, twenty-three lay dead, with seventeen prisoners secured. The wolves had dragged several bodies into the forest—those wouldn't be recovered.

But it was the aftermath that showed the true character of those who'd fought.

Mistress Elba, her blood-stained apron finally replaced with a clean one from her seemingly inexhaustible supply, had taken it upon herself to feed everyone—defender, prisoner, and cavalry alike. She moved through the courtyard with the authority of a grandmother who had fed three children, seven grandchildren, and now armies, carrying pots of stew and chunks of bread to anyone who looked hungry.

"You there!" she called to Commander Atlock, who was conferring with his captains near the gate. "When's the last time you ate?"

The commander, a man who had commanded thousands and faced down nobles, looked taken aback. "I... Mistress, I'm perfectly—"

"That's what I thought. Sit, child." She pointed to a chunk of rubble with the authority of a general deploying troops. "You're no good to anyone if you collapse from hunger. Fighting burns energy, and commanding burns more—learned that watching my Dain work double shifts at the bakery."

"Mistress, I assure you I don't need—"

"SIT." The word carried such absolute authority that Commander Atlock, veteran of dozen campaigns and scourge of bureaucrats, sat.

She thrust a bowl of stew into his hands and stood over him with crossed arms until he began eating. "Good. Now you," she turned to Captain Jorik, "when did you sleep last?"

"I... yesterday evening?"

"Thought so. Eat first, then find somewhere to rest. Can't have cavalry officers falling off their horses from exhaustion." She moved on to Captain Voss. "And you look like you've been living on field rations for a week."

The sight of the most powerful military officer in the region being mothered by a cook drew weak chuckles from everyone within earshot—exactly what Elba intended.

"Heroes need to eat," she declared to the courtyard at large, as if this settled all military policy. "Dead heroes help no one."

And perhaps, watching the weary smiles on faces that had seen too much blood that morning, she wasn't wrong.

Young Finn sat beside Vera's unconscious form, the gash across his ribs bandaged. "She saved me," he kept saying. "She saved me."

Echo perched nearby, occasionally making soft, mournful sounds.

Nearby, Corporal Darric sat propped against a wall, her side heavily bandaged but her dwarven constitution already asserting itself. "Told you," she said to Sergeant Kelen, who was having his own numerous cuts tended. "Takes more than one lucky thrust."

"As you were, Corporal," Kelen replied with the ghost of a smile, the first real emotion he'd shown all day.

Venn was restringing her bow, her quiver empty for the first time in years. "Well," she said to no one in particular, "that was exciting. Let's never do it again."

Fayne sat nearby, exhausted, still counting—casualties, supplies used, patterns in the enemy's retreat. "Pattern suggests," they said quietly, "we won."

Grimjaw stood amid the ruins of his carefully crafted defenses, already calculating what it would take to rebuild. "Could be worse," he said philosophically. "We're alive, mostly. The enemy's broken. And..." He looked at Commander Atlock talking intently with Marcus and Veyra. "Seems we might have new opportunities."

Mistress Elba, her cleaver finally set aside, was already organizing food for everyone—defender, prisoner, and cavalry alike. "Heroes need to eat," she declared, as if that settled everything.

And perhaps it did. They had survived. They had held. The Last Light Company had proven themselves in blood and fire.

But the cost had been high, and the future uncertain.

Vera still hadn't woken up.

The afternoon light had shifted from golden to amber by the time Veyra found herself standing apart from the organized chaos, watching Commander Atlock and Marcus Heartbridge huddle over a salvaged map table near the ruined gate. Their conversation was low, intense, punctuated by Marcus's characteristic hand gestures and Atlock's slow, considering nods.

She approached, and both men looked up. Atlock's weathered face showed something she hadn't expected—respect, certainly, but also a kind of strategic calculation that went beyond simple military appreciation.

"Commander Thornwake," Atlock said, the title carrying new weight. "We were just discussing your future accommodations."

"The Watchpost is done," Marcus added, his usual smoothness subdued but present. "Even Grimjaw admits it would take months to make it defensible again. Which means you need somewhere else." He paused, and something flickered in his eyes—the bard equivalent of a card player revealing a hidden ace. "Somewhere like the Bastion."

Veyra's hand went instinctively to her belt, where the strange lock Marcus had given her in Stonebridge still hung. She'd almost forgotten it in the chaos of recent weeks. "You mentioned this before. An estate sale, you said."

"I may have... undersold its significance." Marcus exchanged a glance with Atlock. "The Bastion isn't just a building. It's a fortress-turned-manor in the Trades Ward, built by a paranoid archmage three centuries ago. Warded foundations, defensible architecture, room enough for a company twice your size. It's been locked and abandoned for decades because—"

"Because no one can open it," Atlock finished. "The wards reject every key, every spell, every attempt at forced entry. The Lords' Alliance has tried. The Blackstaff herself took a look and declared it 'architecturally stubborn.'" A rare hint of amusement crossed his scarred features. "The lock you carry, Commander, is the only piece of the original key mechanism that's surfaced in fifty years."

Veyra pulled the lock from her belt, studying it with new eyes. The metal was warm—warmer than it should be, sitting against her hip all day. "And you just happened to find this at an estate sale."

Marcus's smile was carefully innocent. "Fortune favors the prepared, Commander. I've been tracking pieces of that lock for three years. When I heard about your little operation..." He spread his hands. "Let's say I recognized an opportunity for mutual benefit."

"You're saying we might be able to open a fortress no one else can."

"I'm saying the lock responds to you in ways it never responded to me." Marcus's voice dropped, losing its performative edge. "I held that piece for six months. It was cold metal. You've had it for weeks, and it's practically humming. Whatever that archmage built into his defenses, it seems to like you."

Before Veyra could respond, a commotion near the medical station drew their attention. Aldwin was on his feet, calling for water, and the crowd parted to reveal—

"She's awake," someone breathed.

Veyra was moving before she realized it, pushing through the gathered soldiers until she reached the makeshift cot where Vera lay. The scout's eyes were open, but wrong—unfocused, darting, seeing things that weren't there. Her body trembled with fine tremors, and when she tried to speak, only a rasping whine emerged.

"Easy, easy," Aldwin murmured, one hand on Vera's forehead, the other pressing a cup of water to her cracked lips. "You're safe. You're with friends."

Vera's gaze found Veyra and seemed to anchor there. Recognition flickered, followed by something that might have been relief or might have been terror. Her mouth moved, forming words without sound.

"Don't try to talk," Veyra said, kneeling beside the cot. "You did it. You saved Finn. You saved all of us."

A tear slid from the corner of Vera's eye. Her hand, moving with agonizing slowness, found Veyra's and squeezed with the strength of a newborn kitten.

Echo landed on the cot's edge, making soft crooning sounds that Veyra had never heard from the raven before. Vera's eyes tracked to her companion, and something in her expression eased—not peace, not yet, but perhaps the first step toward it.

"She'll need weeks of rest," Aldwin said quietly to Veyra. "Maybe months. The transformation—" He shook his head. "I've never seen anything like it. She burned through reserves she didn't have. It's a miracle she's breathing at all."

"The druids," Thorne said, appearing at Veyra's shoulder. "Archdruid Silvan's circle. They have experience with transformation magic."

"I'll send word," Marcus said. "I know people who know people."

Vera's grip on Veyra's hand tightened fractionally. Her lips moved again, and this time, the barest whisper emerged: "Worth... it..."

"Don't you dare," Veyra said fiercely. "Don't you dare call this worth it. You're going to recover, and you're going to yell at me for being dramatic, and we're going to have years of arguments about proper scouting protocols. That's an order."

The ghost of a smile touched Vera's cracked lips before her eyes fluttered closed again.

"She needs sleep," Aldwin said. "Real sleep, not unconsciousness. That's actually good news."

Veyra stood, her hand still holding Vera's until the scout's grip relaxed into genuine rest. When she turned, she found an unexpected figure waiting—Harriet Blackwood, the Millbridge matron, somehow present despite the battle having happened miles from her farm.

"Word travels fast when cavalry rides through your fields," Harriet said, answering the unspoken question. She was dusty from the road, her practical dress marked with the signs of hard travel, but her eyes were sharp and her bearing unbowed. "My Thomas told me what happened. What you did for him." She glanced at the unconscious Vera. "What she did for all of us, with that winter business."

"Mrs. Blackwood—"

"I brought blankets," Harriet continued, steamrolling over Veyra's attempt to speak. "And preserved food, and three of my neighbors' wagons. We heard you might need to move, and Millbridge folk pay their debts." She fixed Veyra with the kind of look that had probably terrified her children into compliance for decades. "You saved my son. You don't get to argue about accepting help."

Veyra felt something crack in her chest—not breaking, but releasing. The tension she'd carried since dawn, the weight of command and survival, shifted into something almost bearable.

"Thank you," she managed.

Harriet nodded once, satisfied. "Now. Someone point me at whoever's organizing the evacuation. I've fed harvest crews twice this size."

As the matron marched off to find—and inevitably commandeer—the logistics operation, Atlock appeared at Veyra's side.

"This is what you've built," he said quietly. "Not just soldiers. Community."

"We didn't plan it."

"The best things rarely are planned." Atlock's gaze swept across the courtyard—the cavalry tending to wounded enemies and allies alike, Mistress Elba directing traffic with a soup ladle, Grimjaw already sketching fortification ideas in the dirt, young Finn refusing to leave Vera's side. "I'm going to recommend you for something more than Provisional Civic Asset status. Something permanent."

"Commander—"

"The Lords' Committee will want to meet you. There will be politics, paperwork, probably some very tedious hearings." A hint of dark humor entered his voice. "I'd say I'm sorry, but you've already survived worse."

Marcus drifted back into the conversation, his expression thoughtful. "The Bastion would give you a proper headquarters. Defensible position, central location, room to grow." He met Veyra's eyes. "And I suspect that lock of yours is going to have some interesting stories to tell once you get it home."

The metal was definitely warm now, almost pulsing against her palm like a second heartbeat. Whatever secrets the Bastion held, they were waiting for her.

But first—

"We have wounded to move," Veyra said, her commander's voice returning. "A company to rebuild. And a scout who's going to need a lot of tea and absolutely no excitement for the foreseeable future."

"I'll handle the tea," came Aldwin's voice from beside Vera's cot.

"I'll handle the excitement avoidance," Thorne added dryly. "Someone has to."

And despite everything—the death, the destruction, the uncertain road ahead—Veyra felt her lips twitch toward a smile.

They had held. They had survived. And somewhere in Waterdeep, an ancient fortress was waiting to welcome them home.

The Last Light Company's next chapter was about to begin.
