    source_excerpts:
      - "Vera's eyes were open, but wrong—unfocused, darting, seeing things that weren't there. Her body trembled with fine tremors, and when she tried to speak, only a rasping whine emerged."
      - "A tear slid from the corner of Vera's eye. Her hand, moving with agonizing slowness, found Veyra's and squeezed with the strength of a newborn kitten."
      - "Echo landed on the cot's edge, making soft crooning sounds that Veyra had never heard from the raven before."
      - "'Don't you dare call this worth it. You're going to recover, and you're going to yell at me for being dramatic, and we're going to have years of arguments about proper scouting protocols. That's an order.'"
    
    selection_rationale: "This intimate character moment provides essential emotional closure to the visual arc. After the horror of transformation and hybrid form, we need to see Vera as human—fragile, damaged, but alive. The close framing creates intimacy, and the single tear provides the key visual hook that anchors the emotional weight of her sacrifice."
