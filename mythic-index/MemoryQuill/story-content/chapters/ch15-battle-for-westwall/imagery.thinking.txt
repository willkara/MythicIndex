This is a comprehensive art direction request for Chapter 15: "The Battle for Westwall". Let me analyze what I've received and produce the appropriate imagery.yaml output.

**Chapter Analysis:**
- Battle chapter with high stakes
- Vera's transformation arc is central
- Multiple mood stages: tension → battle → sacrifice → aftermath
- Key locations: battlements, courtyard, medical station, keep interior

**Moment Candidates (6 total):**
1. Vera communion with wolves at dawn (mood piece, pre-battle)
2. Vera's violent transformation (hero image, climax)
3. Mistress Elba defending medical station (anchor, character reveal)
4. Hybrid Vera attacking Krag (anchor, body horror triumph)
5. Defensive circle around unconscious Vera (symbol, found family)
6. Vera waking, fragile and damaged (detail, emotional closure)

**Mood Distribution Planning:**
- Image 1 (Wolf communion): Should be ETHEREAL or OMINOUS (pre-dawn, communion with wild)
- Image 2 (Transformation): KINETIC (violent action, body horror)
- Image 3 (Elba defending): KINETIC or SOMBER (protective violence)
- Image 4 (Hybrid attack): KINETIC (brutal combat)
- Image 5 (Defensive circle): SOMBER or KINETIC (last stand)
- Image 6 (Vera waking): INTIMATE (tender aftermath)

Wait, I need to check variety. If I do:
1. Ethereal/Ominous
2. Kinetic
3. Kinetic
4. Kinetic
5. Kinetic/Somber
6. Intimate

That's too much Kinetic. Let me reconsider:

1. **Ominous** - The communion with wolves has an eerie, pre-battle quality. Her amber eyes glowing in darkness, the wolves responding. This isn't pastoral - it's the wild recognizing a predator.


2. **Kinetic** - Her transformation erupts with raw, primal energy. Bones cracking, muscles twisting, a desperate metamorphosis driven by survival's most intense impulse. The scene captures pure physical transformation - violent, urgent, uncontrolled.

3. **Protective Intensity** - Elba's defense transcends typical combat. In the medical station's intimate space, her protective fury transforms a domestic setting into a battlefield. The cleaver becomes an extension of maternal rage - not just a weapon, but a symbol of fierce guardianship. The mood shifts from pure kinetic violence to a more nuanced emotional landscape of protection and survival.

4. **Visceral Combat** - The hybrid attack embodies pure, brutal physicality. Vera's transformed state unleashes a savage, instinctual assault against Krag. Every movement is a weapon, every strike a primal statement of survival and vengeance.

5. **Somber Resolve** - The defensive formation speaks of quiet heroism. From the high angle, we witness a circle of warriors who understand the potential cost of their resistance. Their unity is not about triumph, but acceptance - a contemplative moment of potential sacrifice, heavy with unspoken understanding.

6. **Fragile Awakening** - Vera's emergence is delicate, almost vulnerable. Her consciousness returns like a whisper, tender and intimate, revealing the human vulnerability beneath the monstrous transformation.

Final distribution balances the narrative's emotional spectrum, acknowledging the chapter's inherent violence while preserving moments of depth and complexity.

Proceeding with detailed image mapping and mood analysis.

The un-natural amber glow of her eyes reveals a liminal connection, where the wolves respond to an otherworldly summons. This communion transcends typical pastoral scenes, instead presenting an eerie, charged atmosphere pregnant with impending violence. The pre-dawn darkness amplifies the sense of something transformative and dangerous emerging.

Vera Moonwhisper embodies this threshold state: a lean, weathered young adult with a pale complexion and dark chestnut hair. Her physical presence suggests efficiency and hidden potential, matching the scene's underlying tension.

Her single practical braid and earth-toned survival gear speak to a life spent navigating wilderness boundaries. The subtle elven markings and scarring hint at past encounters that have shaped her current state of watchful readiness.

Her quarterstaff, "Whisperwind," transforms between weapon and magical focus, reflecting her druidic connection. The brass locket she clutches suggests a deeper emotional anchor, grounding her intense, observant presence against a misty forest backdrop.

Her posture radiates quiet determination - upright yet relaxed, staff held vertically close to her body. A large black raven named Echo perches attentively on her staff's crook, adding to the scene's mystical atmosphere.

The scene shifts with her amber eyes glowing - an internal magical light source that transforms the pre-dawn landscape. Darkness surrounds her, with wolves moving below, creating a sense of imminent, powerful transformation.

The kinetic energy builds as her human form begins breaking apart. Bones crack and shift, silver-gray fur erupting through skin, her amber eyes maintaining a fierce human intelligence even as her physical form mutates.

In the medical station, Elba embodies fierce protective violence. A seasoned dwarven matriarch at 173, her weathered frame speaks of decades of hard labor. Her deep amber eyes scan the environment with sharp, appraising intensity, burn scars and determination etched into her forearms and brow.

Her apron - once stained with kitchen remnants - now drips with blood, a kitchen cleaver gripped tightly. Behind her, a compact halfling medic works methodically on wounded companions. Her stance radiates protective fury, transforming from cook to guardian in an instant.

The scene pulses with raw, visceral energy - a moment of survival and fierce resistance.

Her hybrid form emerges as a twisted testament to survival: part human, part wolf, an impossible anatomy of survival. Amber eyes blaze with human rage, set in an inhuman arrangement. Blood-slicked and triumphant, she embodies the brutal transformation of defense.

The defensive circle forms around her unconscious human form. Each character anchors a point of collective protection: Veyra commanding, Thorne's shield resolute, Grimjaw immovable, Finn having earned his place through shared struggle.

In the intimate aftermath, Vera awakens fragile and broken. Her eyes unfocused, trembling weakly, a single tear tracking her cheek. Veyra's hand clasps hers, Echo perched nearby - a tableau of survival and tender connection.
