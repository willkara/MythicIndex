      CHAPTER 15 VARIATIONS (DIRE WOLF TRANSFORMATION ARC):
      - SCENES 01-04 (Pre-transformation): Human form, practical leather armor, dark brown braided hair with feathers and bone beads. Hazel eyes alert and scanning. Earth-toned leather and canvas. Echo on shoulder. Lean rangy build.
      - SCENE 05-10 (Battle begins): Human but eyes shifting amber when stressed. Bow in hand, moving fast along walls. Protective instincts engaged.
      - SCENE 15 (Full Dire Wolf): Complete transformation—spine elongating, silver-gray fur erupting across skin, twice natural wolf size. Amber eyes blazing. Armor straps snapping. Something primal and protective emerging.
      - SCENES 16-17 (Hybrid Horror): "Not wolf, not woman, but something horribly in between." Half-transformed nightmare state—clawed hands, fangs, glowing amber eyes, gray-silver patches on arms and neck, features sharpened but still recognizable as Vera. Emerging from rubble. Pure protective rage.
      - SCENE 17+ (Aftermath): Collapsed human form, unconscious, pale, trembling. Eyes when open are wrong—unfocused, darting. Only rasping whines instead of speech. Hand finding familiar touch with newborn-kitten strength.
      - Throughout: Echo (raven) always nearby or on shoulder.

      Medium shot of Grimjaw directing two City Watch soldiers in the courtyard at dawn.

Gray morning light, methodical preparation, the courtyard transforming into a killing field one adjustment at a time.
