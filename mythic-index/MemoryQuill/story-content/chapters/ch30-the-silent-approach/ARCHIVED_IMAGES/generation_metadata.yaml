  prompt: "At a stream's edge at night, a water genasi Rill Vossari is a water genasi\
    \ with pale, translucent blue-green skin that has visible turquoise currents moving\
    \ beneath it. She has a strong, athletic swimmer's build. Her most striking feature\
    \ is her hair, which is styled in thick, rope-like dreadlocks that fade from deep\
    \ sea-green at the roots to a pale sea-foam white at the tips, bound with tarnished\
    \ copper wire. Her eyes are the soft, clouded gray of rain about to fall. She\
    \ typically wears a weighted oilskin longcoat over practical sailor's clothing.\n\
    \n\nRill Vossari's appearance immediately marks her as water-touched. Her skin\
    \ has the quality of sea-glass\u2014a pale, translucent blue-green that seems\
    \ to shift in depth depending on the light. In shadow or moonlight, observers\
    \ can see darker turquoise currents moving beneath her skin, swirling gently on\
    \ her cheeks, jawline, and throat. When she's actively working with water, these\
    \ currents quicken into mesmerizing patterns that flow toward her hands.\n\nStanding\
    \ at five feet ten inches with a strong, athletic swimmer's build, Rill has a\
    \ solid, grounded posture. Her shoulders are broad from years of rope work, her\
    \ arms corded with lean muscle. Her hands are a worker's\u2014callused and scarred\
    \ from dock work, yet they move with a fluid, hypnotic grace. Her expression is\
    \ often one of calm, patient focus, but can sharpen into resolute intensity when\
    \ she is observing the water or engaged in a negotiation.\n\nHer hair is her most\
    \ striking feature: thick, rope-like dreadlocks braided into practical tails.\
    \ The color is a natural gradient, shifting from deep sea-green at the roots to\
    \ a pale, sea-foam white at the tips. She binds these braids with tarnished copper\
    \ wire that has developed a verdigris patina from constant water exposure, and\
    \ adorns them with weathered wooden beads carved with the names of significant\
    \ waters.\n\nHer eyes are the soft, clouded gray of rain about to fall. The color\
    \ shifts with weather and mood\u2014slate before storms, silver in sunlight. In\
    \ the right light, the irises seem to contain moving clouds, as if reflecting\
    \ a sky that isn't there. When she is in deep communion with her element, her\
    \ eyes flood entirely with gray, an unnerving effect that marks her focus. and\
    \ a tiefling assassin - **Height/Build**: Average height, with a lean, athletic\
    \ build that suggests disciplined training. Moves with a fluid, almost weightless\
    \ grace.\n- **Skin**: Deep plum-colored skin with a subtle shimmer that catches\
    \ light in certain angles, giving her an almost ethereal quality.\n- **Hair**:\
    \ Surprisingly long auburn hair, typically kept in a tight, severe bun secured\
    \ with an ornate hairpin that doubles as a concealed blade. The rich color provides\
    \ striking contrast against her plum skin.\n- **Horns**: Elegant curved horns\
    \ sweep back from her temples, filed to smooth points. They're relatively short\
    \ and unobtrusive, adding to rather than detracting from her refined appearance.\n\
    - **Eyes**: Golden eyes that seem to notice everything, sharp and intelligent\
    \ with an almost predatory awareness. They have a calculating quality that can\
    \ shift from warm to cold in an instant.\n- **Distinguishing Features**: Her tiefling\
    \ heritage is unmistakable but refined. When using her voice mimicry powers, faint\
    \ flowing wisps of darker purple or shadow manifest around her neck and throat,\
    \ like visible sound waves or smoke dancing across her skin. Despite her distinctive\
    \ appearance, she has an uncanny ability to make herself forgettable when needed.\n\
    - **Typical Clothing**: High-quality, practical clothing that allows for freedom\
    \ of movement but doesn't scream \"operative.\" Think tailored leather jackets,\
    \ dark trousers, and soft-soled boots. Always has hidden pockets. Her clothing\
    \ choices often complement her coloring with deep purples, blacks, and occasional\
    \ burgundy accents.\n- **Body Language**: Composed and confident. Her posture\
    \ changes with her persona\u2014from a flirtatious noble to a deferential servant.\
    \ Her default state is one of relaxed alertness.\n- **Physical Condition**: Peak\
    \ physical condition, a result of rigorous Academy training.\n\nLyra Kestrel is\
