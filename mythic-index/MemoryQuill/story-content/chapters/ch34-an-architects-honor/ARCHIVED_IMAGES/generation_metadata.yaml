    \ an almost ethereal quality.\n- **Hair**: Surprisingly long auburn hair, typically\
    \ kept in a tight, severe bun secured with an ornate hairpin that doubles as a\
    \ concealed blade. The rich color provides striking contrast against her plum\

    \ kept in a severe bun, and her golden eyes are sharp and observant. She has a\
    \ lean, athletic build and moves with a fluid grace. She wears high-quality, practical\
    \ clothing in dark colors. Rill Vossari is a water genasi with pale, translucent\
    \ blue-green skin that has visible turquoise currents moving beneath it. She has\
    \ a strong, athletic swimmer's build. Her most striking feature is her hair, which\
    \ is styled in thick, rope-like dreadlocks that fade from deep sea-green at the\
    \ roots to a pale sea-foam white at the tips, bound with tarnished copper wire.\
    \ Her eyes are the soft, clouded gray of rain about to fall. She typically wears\
    \ a weighted oilskin longcoat over practical sailor's clothing.\n\n\nRill Vossari's\
    \ appearance immediately marks her as water-touched. Her skin has the quality\
    \ of sea-glass\u2014a pale, translucent blue-green that seems to shift in depth\
    \ depending on the light. In shadow or moonlight, observers can see darker turquoise\
    \ currents moving beneath her skin, swirling gently on her cheeks, jawline, and\
    \ throat. When she's actively working with water, these currents quicken into\
    \ mesmerizing patterns that flow toward her hands.\n\nStanding at five feet ten\
    \ inches with a strong, athletic swimmer's build, Rill has a solid, grounded posture.\
    \ Her shoulders are broad from years of rope work, her arms corded with lean muscle.\
    \ Her hands are a worker's\u2014callused and scarred from dock work, yet they\
    \ move with a fluid, hypnotic grace. Her expression is often one of calm, patient\
    \ focus, but can sharpen into resolute intensity when she is observing the water\
    \ or engaged in a negotiation.\n\nHer hair is her most striking feature: thick,\
    \ rope-like dreadlocks braided into practical tails. The color is a natural gradient,\
    \ shifting from deep sea-green at the roots to a pale, sea-foam white at the tips.\
    \ She binds these braids with tarnished copper wire that has developed a verdigris\
    \ patina from constant water exposure, and adorns them with weathered wooden beads\
    \ carved with the names of significant waters.\n\nHer eyes are the soft, clouded\
    \ gray of rain about to fall. The color shifts with weather and mood\u2014slate\
    \ before storms, silver in sunlight. In the right light, the irises seem to contain\
    \ moving clouds, as if reflecting a sky that isn't there. When she is in deep\
    \ communion with her element, her eyes flood entirely with gray, an unnerving\
    \ effect that marks her focus.. Symbolic emphasis: Sketching as creation, solidarity,\
    \ ringing a bell to awaken magic."

    \ skin with a subtle shimmer that catches light in certain angles, giving her\
    \ an almost ethereal quality.\n- **Hair**: Surprisingly long auburn hair, typically\
    \ kept in a tight, severe bun secured with an ornate hairpin that doubles as a\
    \ concealed blade. The rich color provides striking contrast against her plum\
    \ skin.\n- **Horns**: Elegant curved horns sweep back from her temples, filed\
    \ to smooth points. They're relatively short and unobtrusive, adding to rather\
    \ than detracting from her refined appearance.\n- **Eyes**: Golden eyes that seem\
    \ to notice everything, sharp and intelligent with an almost predatory awareness.\
    \ They have a calculating quality that can shift from warm to cold in an instant.\n\

    \ noble to a deferential servant. Her default state is one of relaxed alertness.\n\
    - **Physical Condition**: Peak physical condition, a result of rigorous Academy\
    \ training.\n\nLyra Kestrel is a tiefling with deep plum-colored skin and elegant,\

    \ kept in a severe bun, and her golden eyes are sharp and observant. She has a\
    \ lean, athletic build and moves with a fluid grace. She wears high-quality, practical\
    \ clothing in dark colors. Rill Vossari is a water genasi with pale, translucent\
    \ blue-green skin that has visible turquoise currents moving beneath it. She has\
    \ a strong, athletic swimmer's build. Her most striking feature is her hair, which\
    \ is styled in thick, rope-like dreadlocks that fade from deep sea-green at the\
    \ roots to a pale sea-foam white at the tips, bound with tarnished copper wire.\
    \ Her eyes are the soft, clouded gray of rain about to fall. She typically wears\
    \ a weighted oilskin longcoat over practical sailor's clothing.\n\n\nRill Vossari's\
    \ appearance immediately marks her as water-touched. Her skin has the quality\
    \ of sea-glass\u2014a pale, translucent blue-green that seems to shift in depth\
    \ depending on the light. In shadow or moonlight, observers can see darker turquoise\
    \ currents moving beneath her skin, swirling gently on her cheeks, jawline, and\
    \ throat. When she's actively working with water, these currents quicken into\
    \ mesmerizing patterns that flow toward her hands.\n\nStanding at five feet ten\
    \ inches with a strong, athletic swimmer's build, Rill has a solid, grounded posture.\
    \ Her shoulders are broad from years of rope work, her arms corded with lean muscle.\
    \ Her hands are a worker's\u2014callused and scarred from dock work, yet they\
    \ move with a fluid, hypnotic grace. Her expression is often one of calm, patient\
    \ focus, but can sharpen into resolute intensity when she is observing the water\
    \ or engaged in a negotiation.\n\nHer hair is her most striking feature: thick,\
    \ rope-like dreadlocks braided into practical tails. The color is a natural gradient,\
    \ shifting from deep sea-green at the roots to a pale, sea-foam white at the tips.\
    \ She binds these braids with tarnished copper wire that has developed a verdigris\
    \ patina from constant water exposure, and adorns them with weathered wooden beads\
    \ carved with the names of significant waters.\n\nHer eyes are the soft, clouded\
    \ gray of rain about to fall. The color shifts with weather and mood\u2014slate\
    \ before storms, silver in sunlight. In the right light, the irises seem to contain\
    \ moving clouds, as if reflecting a sky that isn't there. When she is in deep\
    \ communion with her element, her eyes flood entirely with gray, an unnerving\
    \ effect that marks her focus.. Symbolic emphasis: Sketching as creation, solidarity,\
    \ ringing a bell to awaken magic."

    \ She binds these braids with tarnished copper wire that has developed a verdigris\
    \ patina from constant water exposure, and adorns them with weathered wooden beads\
    \ carved with the names of significant waters.\n\nHer eyes are the soft, clouded\
    \ gray of rain about to fall. The color shifts with weather and mood\u2014slate\
    \ before storms, silver in sunlight. In the right light, the irises seem to contain\
    \ moving clouds, as if reflecting a sky that isn't there. When she is in deep\
    \ communion with her element, her eyes flood entirely with gray, an unnerving\
    \ effect that marks her focus.. Symbolic emphasis: Sketching as creation, solidarity,\
    \ ringing a bell to awaken magic."
