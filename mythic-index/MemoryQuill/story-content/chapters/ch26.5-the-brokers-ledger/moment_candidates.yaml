      visual_character: "Third-floor corner office of obsessive precision—polished desk surface reflecting a single brass lamp, ledgers arranged with mathematical exactness, the careful anonymity of successful discretion. Wood-paneled walls absorb sound; the window shows only the backs of neighboring buildings."

Three separate ledgers lay before him: the Public Ledger, bound in brown leather and maintained in perfect order for any official inspection; the Private Ledger, in blue leather, which recorded the actual financial details of his more discreet clientele; and the Special Contracts ledger, bound in unmarked black leather, which contained only coded entries for his most exclusive arrangements."
