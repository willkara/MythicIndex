> [EPIGRAPH]
> "The most successful operations are built on professional compartmentalization. Each participant knows precisely what they need to know to perform their role competently, and nothing more. Curiosity is a luxury that efficient logistics cannot afford. Questions beyond the scope of one's responsibilities are not just unprofessional—they are destructive to the entire enterprise."

The offices of Thornweave Shipping Concern occupied three floors of a narrow building wedged between a rope chandler and a sail-maker in the heart of Waterdeep's Dock Ward. From the outside, it looked like any of the dozen similar enterprises that lined the wharf—legitimate, prosperous, unremarkable. Which was exactly how Aldric Thornweave preferred it.

Aldric was a man who understood that the most successful businesses were those that never drew attention to themselves. At fifty-two, he had built his reputation on reliability, discretion, and the ability to move cargo from any point A to any point B with minimal questions asked. His silver hair was neatly trimmed, his clothes well-tailored but not ostentatious, and his manner suggested competent professionalism rather than excessive ambition.

As evening settled over the Dock Ward and the last of the legitimate merchants locked their doors, Aldric climbed to his private office on the third floor. This was his favorite time of day—when the public face of his business could be set aside and he could review the more... specialized aspects of his operations.

His desk was organized with obsessive precision. Three separate ledgers lay before him: the Public Ledger, bound in brown leather and maintained in perfect order for any official inspection; the Private Ledger, in blue leather, which recorded the actual financial details of his more discreet clientele; and the Special Contracts ledger, bound in unmarked black leather, which contained only coded entries for his most exclusive arrangements.

He opened the Public Ledger first, as was his habit. The entries were exactly what they appeared to be: grain shipments to Neverwinter, textile deliveries to Baldur's Gate, pottery transported to smaller coastal towns. Profitable, legal, boring. The perfect camouflage.

"The Private Ledger told a different story. Here were the premium services—moving cargo that customs officials were encouraged not to examine too closely, ensuring certain packages reached their destinations without passing through standard inspection procedures, providing transportation for individuals who preferred to travel without appearing on passenger manifests. Still legal, technically, but requiring a more sophisticated understanding of regulatory nuances."

It was the Special Contracts ledger that contained his most interesting work.

Aldric turned to the most recent entries, running his finger down the coded notations that would mean nothing to casual observers but told him everything he needed to know about his most exclusive client relationship.

Aldric nodded with satisfaction. The Veridian Agronomics account had become increasingly profitable over the past year. What had started as occasional shipments of legitimate agricultural equipment had evolved into a steady stream of specialized deliveries that commanded premium rates.

He didn't ask what "Agricultural Supplies (Specialized)" actually meant. In his line of work, curiosity was a liability. He knew that the packages were always the right size and weight for his boats, always properly secured for transport, and always generated payments that arrived promptly and in full. The Shepherd's organization was everything a shipper could want in a client: punctual, professional, and profitable.

The beauty of the arrangement was its simplicity. Veridian Agronomics was a legitimate research institution with proper documentation and standing contracts. The cargo was described in terms that wouldn't raise eyebrows with dock inspectors. The delivery routes followed established waterways to a private estate dock that appeared on all official maps. From Aldric's perspective, he was simply providing premium shipping services to a valued agricultural research client.

If there were other aspects to the arrangement—if the "Agricultural Supplies" were something other than what they appeared, if the research center served purposes beyond botanical studies—well, that was outside his sphere of concern. He was a shipping broker, not a customs inspector.

"A soft knock at his office door interrupted his review. "Come," he called.

His senior clerk, a thin man named Hobbs with thirty years of experience in delicate logistics, entered with a leather message pouch.

"The evening dispatches, sir," Hobbs said, setting the pouch on the desk. "Including new arrangements from our northern associates."

Aldric opened the pouch and extracted a single sheet of high-quality paper bearing the discrete watermark he'd learned to recognize. The message was brief and written in the formal style he'd come to expect:

*Thornweave Shipping Concern*  
*Re: Expanded Transportation Requirements*

*Circumstances require acceleration of spring transport schedule. Effective immediately, arrange for enhanced capacity on the northern lake route. Prepare for priority deliveries of Agricultural Supplies (Specialized) occurring daily through month-end.*

*Standard discretion protocols remain in effect. Premium rates approved for expedited service.*

*Per the Shepherd's directive.*

Aldric smiled. Enhanced capacity meant larger boats, more crews, and significantly higher fees. Daily deliveries meant steady work and reliable income. The spring season was shaping up to be very profitable indeed.

"Hobbs," he said, "I'll need you to contact our northern boat crews. We're expanding operations for the remainder of the month. Premium wages for all hands, discretion bonuses as usual."

"Very good, sir. The usual routes?"

"The usual routes." Aldric folded the message and locked it in his desk drawer. "And Hobbs? Remind the crews that our clients value reliability above all else. I expect our reputation for professional service to remain unblemished."

"Of course, sir."

As Hobbs departed, Aldric returned to his ledgers. Three more entries to record, crew schedules to arrange, and boat manifests to prepare. The increased tempo would require careful coordination, but that was what separated Thornweave Shipping from the dozens of less sophisticated operations that cluttered the docks.

He opened his Special Contracts ledger to a fresh page and began recording the new arrangements. Whatever "Agricultural Supplies (Specialized)" actually meant, whoever the Shepherd really was, and whatever purposes drove Veridian Agronomics' accelerated timeline, Aldric Thornweave would ensure that every delivery arrived precisely when and where it was supposed to.

After all, reputation was everything in the shipping business.

As midnight approached and the Dock Ward settled into its nighttime quiet, Aldric completed his ledger entries and locked them away. Tomorrow would bring new schedules, new crews, and new cargo to transport along the northern lake route.

But tonight, he was simply a successful shipping broker, managing the logistics of legitimate agricultural research. The fact that his definition of "legitimate" might differ from others' was irrelevant.

Business was business, after all.
