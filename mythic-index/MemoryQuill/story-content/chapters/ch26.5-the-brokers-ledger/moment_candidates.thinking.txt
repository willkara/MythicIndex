Let me analyze this chapter carefully through the Visual Story Analyst framework.

## Chapter Overview
This is an interlude chapter (26.5) focusing on Aldric Thornweave, a shipping broker who is unknowingly (or willfully ignorantly) facilitating the transportation of what appears to be human trafficking victims ("Agricultural Supplies (Specialized)" = people) for the main antagonist organization (The Shepherd).

## Key Elements
- POV: Aldric Thornweave
- Location: Thornweave Shipping Concern offices in Dock Ward
- Time: Evening, settling into night
- Tone: Mundane evil, professional complicity, willful ignorance

## Scene Analysis (scn-26-5-01: "The Evening Review")

### Potential Visual Beats to Evaluate

1. **The building exterior at dusk** - narrow building between rope chandler and sail-maker, Dock Ward setting
2. **Aldric at his desk with three ledgers** - the color-coded ledger system (brown/blue/black)
3. **Reading the ledger entries** - close-up on the coded entries, particularly "47 units" euphemism
4. **Hobbs entering with the message pouch** - the subordinate dynamic
5. **The Shepherd's message/watermark reveal** - the coded communication
6. **Aldric's satisfied smile** - the moment of profit over morality
7. **Midnight ledger completion** - ending alone, locked away records

### Applying the Five Lenses

**Moment 1: The Building Exterior at Dusk**
- Emotional Resonance: 2 (establishing, not emotionally charged)
- Visual Distinctiveness: 3 (generic Dock Ward scene, though evocative)
- Narrative Pivot: 1 (no story change)
- Character Revelation: 2 (shows his desire for anonymity)
- Symbolic Density: 3 (camouflage, hiding in plain sight)


- **Total: 11** - Below threshold, reject

**Moment 2: Aldric at his desk with three ledgers**
The color-coded ledgers reveal a complex system of moral compartmentalization. Brown represents legitimate business, blue indicates gray areas, and black symbolizes the darkest transactions. His meticulous organization exposes a calculated approach to ethical compromise, where each color strategically masks the true nature of his operations.

The visual metaphor of these ledgers demonstrates Thornweave's psychological mechanism for distancing himself from the human trafficking he facilitates. By creating a structured, almost bureaucratic system, he transforms moral horror into a clinical, detached process of documentation and profit.

**Moment 3: Reading "47 units"**
The clinical language of "Agricultural Supplies" masks a horrifying reality. By reducing human lives to numerical entries, Aldric practices the quintessential banality of evil - transforming people into commodities through bureaucratic euphemism. His finger tracing the ledger entries reveals a chilling willingness to ignore the human cost of his transactions.

**Moment 4: Hobbs entering with message pouch**
A routine office interaction betrays the systemic nature of the operation. The hierarchical exchange suggests a normalized infrastructure of exploitation, where human trafficking is processed like any other administrative task.

**Moment 5: The Shepherd's watermark reveal**
A subtle marker of power emerges through the discrete watermark on quality paper. This nuanced detail suggests hidden networks operating with calculated precision, where control is exercised through understated symbols of authority.

**Moment 6: Aldric's satisfied smile at "enhanced capacity"**
His expression crystallizes the moral bankruptcy of pure profit. A smile illuminated by lamplight captures the precise moment where human suffering becomes mere economic opportunity - wealth purchased through willful ignorance and calculated detachment.

**Moment 7: Midnight ledger completion**
Solitary and ritualistic, the final accounting represents more than numerical reconciliation. The act of sealing documents at midnight symbolizes the quiet, systematic concealment of uncomfortable truths, with isolation itself becoming a method of suppression.

### Strategic Moment Selection

I'll prioritize moments that reveal systemic violence through intimate, granular details. The chapter's power emerges not through dramatic confrontation, but through bureaucratic banality - each interaction a thread in a larger, oppressive tapestry.

Key selection criteria:
- Interior spatial dynamics
- Subtle character revelation
- Symbolic weight of mundane actions

Focusing on interior moments allows deeper exploration of institutional mechanisms. The existing facade image provides external context, freeing interior moments to probe psychological and structural nuances.

Potential moments crystallize around Aldric's methodical documentation, each ledger entry a quiet act of power and potential erasure.

The selected moments trace an arc of complicity: from bureaucratic detail to systemic infrastructure, culminating in Aldric's calculated moral choice. Each moment - ledger entries, watermark, final smile - reveals layers of institutional violence through seemingly neutral administrative acts.

The chapter's compact 1373-word structure supports a focused 4-moment analysis, with each fragment exposing different dimensions of ethical erosion. Despite being confined to a single scene and perspective, the moments provide nuanced insight into how systemic corruption operates through mundane transactions.

I'll prioritize interior visual moments that haven't been pre-documented, ensuring my selection reveals narrative complexity without redundancy. The existing "mundane-facade.png" already captures exterior context, so my focus shifts to granular interior details that illuminate power dynamics.

My selected moments strategically dissect Aldric's bureaucratic manipulation: wide establishing shot revealing systemic infrastructure, close textual evidence of quantified deception, symbolic watermark suggesting institutional complicity, and a character reaction capturing moral compromise.

The selection meets coverage guidelines through varied framing and thematic depth, even while acknowledging the chapter's inherent spatial and perspective limitations.
