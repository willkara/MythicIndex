The first few days after the Azure Pavilion gathering had been consumed with practical matters—moving into the warehouse, organizing their new headquarters, and adjusting to the strange reality of being officially recognized by Waterdeep's authority. The political theater of that evening felt like a distant dream compared to the immediate challenges of daily life in the city.

But by the end of their first week, the cost of their new status was becoming clear.

The morning sun cast long shadows through the grimy windows as Marcus Heartbridge led his companions through the maze of corridors toward Captain Grimsby's office. He'd insisted that both Veyra and Thorne accompany him—this wasn't the kind of meeting where the Company's leadership could be represented by proxies.

"Commander," Marcus said quietly as they approached the anteroom, "remember Grimsby's toast about order and adherence to procedure? I suspect we're about to learn exactly what he meant by that."

Veyra studied the bustling activity around them—clerks hurrying past with armfuls of documents, City Watch officers conferring in hushed tones, the constant undertone of organized urgency that marked a working headquarters. This was a different world from the direct action she was accustomed to, all procedure and politics and careful maneuvering.

"How much flexibility do we actually have?" she asked.

"Less than we'd like, more than they'll admit," Marcus replied diplomatically. "The key is understanding what they truly need versus what they say they want."

"Commander Thornwake, Captain Brightward, Master Heartbridge," Captain Grimsby emerged from his office, flanked by a woman Veyra didn't recognize. She was perhaps fifty years old, with silver-streaked auburn hair and sharp gray-green eyes that seemed to catalog every detail they encountered. Her clothing spoke of authority without ostentation—expensive but practical, designed for someone who commanded attention through competence rather than display.

"Thank you for responding so promptly. May I introduce Lady Moira Blackwater from the Lords' Intelligence Coordination Office."

Veyra felt Thorne's almost imperceptible stiffening beside her. The intelligence office was several levels above routine City Watch operations—this was serious indeed.

"Lady Blackwater," Marcus said smoothly, offering a diplomatic bow. "An honor."

"The pleasure is mine, Master Heartbridge." Lady Blackwater's voice carried the cultured precision of someone equally comfortable briefing nobles or field operatives. "Your reputation for... creative solutions precedes you. As does your recent success at the Westwall Watchpost—remarkable tactical improvisation under impossible odds."

Veyra caught the subtle assessment in that comment. Lady Blackwater wasn't just being polite—she'd studied their operations, understood their capabilities, and was making her own evaluation of their worth.

They were ushered into Grimsby's office, though Veyra noticed Lady Blackwater moved to the position of authority with practiced ease. The leather portfolio she carried bore multiple official seals, and when she spread documents across Grimsby's desk, they were marked with intelligence classifications Veyra had never seen before.

"Before we begin," Lady Blackwater said, settling into her chair with the controlled grace of someone trained for both boardroom and battlefield, "I want to establish parameters. What I'm about to share falls under intelligence protocols that extend beyond normal City Watch jurisdiction."

"Your Company's provisional status," Lady Blackwater began without preamble, "was granted with the understanding that specialized capabilities would be available when the city's needs exceeded conventional resources."

Marcus glanced at Veyra, a subtle warning in his expression. "We're always willing to serve the city's interests. What assistance do you require?"

"The Silent Hand."

Veyra felt the weight of those words immediately. She'd heard the name from Vera's investigation, but the reaction from both Marcus and Thorne suggested implications she was still learning.

Lady Blackwater opened her portfolio and began arranging documents with methodical precision. "The Silent Hand represents what we classify as a Tier One unconventional threat. They operate with resources and sophistication that suggest backing beyond typical criminal enterprises."

She placed a series of sketches on the desk—surveillance reports, architectural assessments, and magical analysis reports that bore classification marks Veyra had never seen.

"Our conventional assets have attempted infiltration twice," she continued with the matter-of-fact tone of someone briefing professional operatives. "Both attempts failed at the perimeter. No casualties, but complete intelligence failure."

Veyra studied the documents, noting the professional quality of the surveillance work. "Where is this facility located?"

"Approximately ten miles outside the city's northern gate," Lady Blackwater replied, spreading out a regional map. "Built near the confluence of two streams that feed into a small lake. The location was chosen deliberately—close enough for convenient access, far enough to avoid city oversight."

"And isolated enough for their operations," Thorne added grimly.

"Precisely. The facility is a converted estate, originally built as a merchant's summer retreat. Multiple buildings, extensive grounds, and most importantly, sophisticated magical defenses integrated with the natural water features."

"What exactly makes this facility so impregnable?" Veyra asked.

"Purpose-built magical suppression systems integrated with physical security measures. The intelligence indicates systematic imprisonment and conditioning of magical captives—primarily children with emerging abilities." Lady Blackwater's clinical language couldn't disguise the horror of what she was describing. "We're not dealing with opportunistic slavers. This is organized magical trafficking with strategic objectives."

Thorne leaned forward, his military mind engaging with the tactical assessment. "What's their ultimate goal?"

"Unknown, but the pattern suggests either systematic removal of magical talent from Waterdeep's population, or conditioning captured individuals for specific purposes." Lady Blackwater fixed Veyra with her assessing gaze. "Either scenario represents a direct threat to city security that requires immediate intervention."

Marcus shifted slightly in his chair. "And our cooperation in this matter would naturally reflect positively during our charter review?"

Lady Blackwater's smile was thin and professional. "Assets that prove reliable for critical missions tend to find their administrative processes... streamlined. Conversely, organizations that prove reluctant to assist during genuine emergencies often discover that bureaucratic scrutiny can be quite thorough."

Veyra looked between the two officials, beginning to understand the game being played. This wasn't a request—it was an obligation wrapped in diplomatic language. The Company's independence was more limited than she'd realized.

"What timeline are we working with?" Thorne asked, his military directness cutting through the political maneuvering.

"Intelligence suggests they may relocate operations within the month," Grimsby replied, consulting his notes. "We need actionable intelligence before that happens."

"We'll need complete access to your intelligence files," Veyra said, her command voice emerging. "Full operational autonomy in our methods. And formal documentation that this mission is at the direct request of both the City Watch and the Lords' Intelligence Office."

Lady Blackwater smiled approvingly. "I see why your reputation for thoroughness is so well established. Captain Grimsby has prepared all necessary documentation and intelligence summaries."

A leather portfolio slid across the desk toward them, thick with documents and marked with official seals that spoke of high-level authorization.

"The target location, complete intelligence assessments, and formal mission authorization," Lady Blackwater explained. "Everything needed to begin your assessment."

Marcus reached for the portfolio, but Veyra caught his wrist gently. "One question. If this facility is as sophisticated as your reports suggest, what makes you confident we can succeed where other attempts have failed?"

Lady Blackwater's smile sharpened. "Because, Commander, you have resources and methods that aren't constrained by official procedures. Sometimes the city's needs require... flexibility."

She stood, gathering her documents with practiced efficiency. "Now, there's another matter. We have several Black Hawks mercenaries in custody from the Westwall incident. Standard interrogation methods have proven... unproductive."

She turned to Grimsby with a polite but firm expression. "Captain Grimsby, I believe you have pressing duties that require your attention elsewhere."

"My lady," Thorne interjected, surprising everyone with his diplomatic tone. "Captain Grimsby has been instrumental in coordinating our integration with the Watch. Perhaps he should remain for—"

"Captain," Lady Blackwater said smoothly, cutting Thorne off with a raised hand while still addressing Grimsby, "if you would?" Her tone remained polite but absolute.

Grimsby stood immediately, understanding the dismissal. Thorne started to speak again, but Atlock caught his arm with a subtle shake of his head.

"This next part requires... a certain subtlety," Lady Blackwater said, her eyes moving between Thorne and Grimsby. "The Captain understands."

Grimsby nodded stiffly. "Of course, Lady Blackwater. I'll ensure you're not disturbed." He left his own office with military precision, closing the door firmly behind him.

The moment Grimsby's door closed, the office seemed to transform. Lady Blackwater moved to Grimsby's desk with casual authority, settling into his chair as if it had always belonged to her. Commander Atlock emerged from where he'd been waiting by the window—clearly, this discussion had been orchestrated well before the morning's meeting.

"Now then," Lady Blackwater said, spreading additional documents across the desk's surface. "We can speak more freely."

The afternoon sun slanted through the windows, casting longer shadows that emphasized the shift in atmosphere. Where moments before this had been a place of administrative order, it now felt like a stage being set for something more delicate.

"The mercenaries we captured know something about the Silent Hand's operations," Lady Blackwater began, her demeanor shifting to something more predatory. "We need that information. Their operational window is closing."

"The Black Hawks are proving more difficult than anticipated," Atlock confirmed, his voice a low gravelly sound. "Standard methods have yielded nothing. They're disciplined, well-trained. All we're getting is name and rank. They know their rights under the city's codes regarding prisoners of war."

"Which is precisely why standard methods have proven inadequate," Lady Blackwater said, her fingers tracing patterns on one of the documents. "They're not common criminals who can be pressured with threats of harsh sentences. They're professionals who understand exactly what protections the law affords them."

Thorne, leaning over the map, traced a finger along the Westwall district. "If we don't find out who their contact is and what the larger plan is, we're just swatting flies while the rot spreads."

Lady Blackwater's gaze drifted from the grim faces of her soldiers, past Veyra who was studying the intelligence reports, and settled on the one person in the room who had remained silent throughout the briefing. Marcus Heartbridge had been moving casually around the office, examining the leather-bound volumes on Grimsby's bookshelf with the air of someone browsing a library. He'd helped himself to a snifter of what appeared to be quite good whiskey from the crystal decanter on the side table, seemingly more interested in appraising its quality than the strategic discussion unfolding around him.

"The direct approach is failing," Lady Blackwater said, her tone shifting from command to something more contemplative. She looked directly at Marcus. "Perhaps it's time for a more nuanced conversation. Marcus, I trust you're prepared for a trip downstairs?"

Veyra looked up from her papers and a smirk played on her lips. She leaned back in her chair, glancing at Marcus with amusement. "What's the plan, then? Are we going to ply them with wine and song until they confess their deepest secrets?"

A brief, almost imperceptible smile touched Lady Blackwater's lips. The girl still thinks his only weapons are a silver tongue and a lute string, she thought to herself with a flicker of dark humor. She's about to learn what a skilled artist can do with a man's soul instead of a canvas.

Out loud, she simply said, "Something like that, Veyra." Her eyes, however, held a knowing, almost pitying look. "Though I find Marcus's particular vintage... is often a little less palatable."

Atlock and Thorne exchanged a brief, grimly understanding glance. They had seen the results of Marcus's "negotiations" before. They didn't ask questions.

"He gets results," Thorne muttered, more to the map than to anyone else.

"Exactly," Lady Blackwater said, her authority returning. "Commander, you and Lieutenant Tomaq have one of them isolated, correct? The officer, Brenner?"

"Yes, my lady," Atlock confirmed. "He's waiting."

"Good," she said, straightening up. "Take Mr. Heartbridge down." She paused, her eyes meeting Marcus's directly. "I'm granting you considerable flexibility in how you interpret the city's codes regarding prisoner treatment."

Marcus pushed himself away from the window, his charming smile back in place, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. "Of course, my lady. It's always a pleasure to have a good, honest chat."

Veyra watched him, her smirk fading into curiosity at the sudden gravity in the room. She still thought she was about to watch a master of persuasion. She had no idea she was about to witness an artist of psychological warfare. As they all stood and headed for the door, the warmth of Grimsby's sunlit office already felt like a distant memory, a stark contrast to the cold stone and damp shadows that awaited them below.

The holding cells beneath the City Watch headquarters were a stark contrast to the administrative floors above. Here, stone replaced wood, dampness replaced warmth, and the only sounds were the occasional cough or mutter from behind iron bars. The Black Hawks mercenaries captured at Westwall were being held in separate cells, isolated from each other to prevent collaboration on their stories.

Lieutenant Tomaq stood outside the interrogation chamber, his scarred face impassive as Marcus Heartbridge approached, followed by Veyra, Thorne, and Commander Atlock.

"The one we want is called Brenner," Tomaq rumbled, his deep voice echoing slightly in the stone corridor. "Mid-level officer in Krag's organization. Smart enough to know things, not important enough that Krag would have told him to die rather than talk."

"And he's resisted conventional interrogation?" Marcus asked, already slipping into a different persona—colder, more calculating.

"Won't say anything beyond name and rank," Tomaq confirmed. "Claims he's a legitimate mercenary, knows nothing about wider operations."

"May I?" Marcus asked, gesturing toward the door.

Atlock and Tomaq exchanged glances. "Lady Blackwater granted you... flexibility," Atlock said carefully, the pause speaking volumes.

"I understand the boundaries perfectly," Marcus replied, his smile sharp as a blade. "Physical torture is crude, unreliable, and quite illegal. But the mind... the mind can be its own torturer with the right encouragement. All perfectly legal, I assure you."

The interrogation chamber was sparse—a table, two chairs, stone walls that seemed to press inward. Brenner sat shackled to his chair, a lean man with calculating eyes and the kind of stubble that suggested he'd been here several days. He looked up as Marcus entered, immediately wary of this well-dressed stranger.

Marcus didn't sit immediately. Instead, he circled the table slowly, letting silence build until it became oppressive. Through the observation slit, Veyra watched with growing unease as Marcus transformed from diplomat to something else entirely.

"Brenner," Marcus finally said, his voice a soft, conversational murmur. "Thirty-two years old. Born in Luskan. Your mother, Elara. She still runs The Salty Anchor near the docks. A charming place, though the sea-damp is starting to rot the floorboards by the east wall. Your sister, Lyra... that birthmark on her neck, just below her left ear... it's shaped a bit like a falling tear."

The mercenary's breathing became shallow, his shackled hands clenching into white-knuckled fists on the table. A faint tremor ran through his fingers. "Stay away from them."

Marcus stopped circling. His eyes flicked down to Brenner's trembling hands, and a small, almost clinical smile touched his lips. He didn't raise his voice. He didn't move quickly. Instead, he walked slowly, deliberately, around the table until he stood beside the shackled man.

Through the observation slit, Veyra tensed, expecting a blow.

But Marcus didn't strike. He simply reached down and gently, with an unshakable firmness, placed his hand over Brenner's clenched fist. The gesture was shockingly intimate in the cold, stark room. He applied just enough pressure to slowly, inexorably, uncurl Brenner's fingers until his hand lay flat and exposed under Marcus's palm.

"Shhh," Marcus said, his voice a low whisper, almost a caress, right next to Brenner's ear. "Anger is a shield, not a weapon. And yours has cracks in it. I can feel them."

He leaned in closer, his presence overwhelming in the small space. Brenner was frozen, pinned by a touch that was not violent, but was an absolute assertion of dominance.

"Every man has a fortress," Marcus continued, his thumb tracing a slow, idle circle on the back of Brenner's hand. "Yours is quite strong. But the foundation is made of two women in Luskan. And from here, I can feel the tremors every time I mention their names. I don't need to break your walls, Brenner. I just need to whisper the right words into the cracks until the whole thing collapses on top of you."

He gave the hand a final, condescending pat, as one would a nervous dog, and released it.

Marcus returned to his seat as if nothing had happened, his composure perfect. Brenner stared at his own hand on the table, now feeling violated and exposed, the warmth from Marcus's touch a phantom presence. He was breathing heavily, his defiance completely dismantled without a single threat being uttered.

"Now," Marcus said, his voice returning to a conversational tone as he pulled a folder from his coat that Veyra hadn't even noticed him carrying. "Let's discuss the future." 

He opened the folder and slid a charcoal sketch across the table—a detailed portrait of a young woman with distinctive features, including a birthmark on her neck. "This drawing can remain a fond memory. An artist's tribute. Or, it can become a prospectus, sent by raven to a certain collector of rare beauties in Port Llast. A man with a particular taste for unique features."

He let the words hang in the air. The threat was the same, but now it was underpinned by the memory of that touch, that absolute control. Brenner understood that Marcus wasn't just talking about influencing people from afar. He was a man who could walk right up to you, peel back your defenses with his bare hands, and whisper your world away.

"Your mother will receive a letter," Marcus continued, his tone remaining conversational. "Official notification that her son was involved in an attack on a civic institution. The payments you've been sending—every month, regular as clockwork, twenty gold pieces—will stop. The tavern will be investigated for receiving terrorist funds. Even if they find nothing—and they won't, your mother is innocent—the reputation will destroy her business."

He leaned forward slightly. "Or... you can be a cooperative mercenary who was simply following orders, didn't know the full scope, and provides valuable intelligence. Mercenaries get five years labor detail. With good behavior, maybe three. The payments to your mother continue from your seized assets. She never needs to know you were anything but the caravan guard she believes you to be."

Through the observation slit, Thorne muttered, "Gods, he's not even raising his voice."

Brenner's resolve had completely crumbled.

"The Silent Hand," Brenner said hoarsely. "Krag had a contact. Never saw him directly, but Krag called him 'the Shepherd.' Said we were doing advance work for a bigger operation."

"What kind of operation?" Marcus pressed gently.

"Disruption. Make the Last Light Company look incompetent or dangerous. Create justification for their dissolution so the Silent Hand's operations could continue without their interference."

"And these operations?"

"Moving people. Special cargo, Krag called them. Kids mostly, ones with magical talent. There's a facility outside the city—"

"We know about the facility," Marcus interrupted. "Tell me about the timeline."

"Spring shipping season starts soon. Big movement planned for the new moon—that's in three weeks. After that, the whole operation shifts north for the summer."

Marcus stood smoothly. "Thank you, Brenner. Your cooperation has been noted."

As he left the chamber, he paused at the door. "Oh, and Brenner? If any of this information proves false, our deal is void. And I have a very long memory."

He stepped out into the corridor. The moment the heavy oak door thudded shut, the transformation was staggering. The cold predator vanished. Marcus let out a long breath and immediately tugged at the high collar of his shirt, unfastening the top button.

"Gods, the damp in there," he muttered, rolling up a cuff. "Goes right through the linen."

Veyra stared at him, her expression a mixture of awe and terror. "Marcus... you wouldn't actually..."

He glanced at her, his easy, charming smile back in place as if it had never left. He finished neatly folding his cuff before answering, his voice light.

"He believed I would," Marcus said simply. "That's the only part of it that has to be true."

As they walked away from the cells in silence, Veyra realized she hadn't seen a mask slip to reveal the real man. She had just watched him casually exchange one perfectly crafted mask for another, and she had the terrifying feeling that she might never know which one was his true face—or if he even had one at all.

"Necessary," Marcus added, as if remembering her earlier question. "And far kinder than what Tomaq would have done eventually. Information obtained through fear of pain is unreliable. Information obtained through careful psychological pressure and self-interest? That tends to be true."

Atlock nodded grimly. "They're preparing to move the captives. That's our timeline."

"Then we'd better get back to Lady Blackwater," Thorne said. "She needs to know what we've learned."

As they walked back toward the administrative levels, Veyra found herself reassessing Marcus yet again. The charming diplomat was genuine, but it was only one facet of a much more complex—and dangerous—individual.

They emerged from the Watch headquarters into the bustling streets of Waterdeep, the afternoon sun a stark contrast to the cold stones they'd left behind. Veyra walked in contemplative silence, processing not just the intelligence they'd gathered, but the methods used to obtain it.

"The fragile truce from the Azure Pavilion is already bearing fruit," Marcus said quietly, his earlier coldness completely absent. "Or revealing its thorns, depending on your perspective."

"The mission itself is legitimate," Thorne added, his voice carrying a weight of understanding. "If half of what we just heard is true, the Silent Hand represents a genuine threat."

"But we're not choosing this mission," Veyra observed, looking back at the imposing structure of the Watch headquarters. "We're being directed to it."

Marcus nodded, adjusting his cuffs one final time. "The difference between being heroes and being weapons. It's a distinction that matters, even when the target deserves what's coming."

The weight of that distinction hung between them as they made their way through the crowds, each processing the morning's revelations in their own way.

Three days into their residency, an invitation arrived that caught the Company by surprise. The Spire of Learning, Waterdeep's most prestigious academic institution, was requesting their participation in a public symposium on "Tactical Innovation in Siege Defense."

"They want to study us," Thorne observed, reading the formal invitation with a mixture of amusement and wariness.

"They want to legitimize us," Marcus corrected. "Academic recognition carries weight in this city. If the scholars approve of your methods, the nobles pay attention."

The symposium took place in the Spire's grand amphitheater, its tiered seating packed with military officers, City Watch brass, and enough nobles to populate a small court. Commander Atlock had been invited as the primary speaker, but he insisted the Last Light Company share the stage.

"The cavalry charge was textbook," Atlock explained to the audience, using a detailed map to illustrate the tactical situation. "But the real innovation came from our allies' defensive adaptations under impossible conditions."

He gestured to Thorne, who stepped forward with the composed bearing of a professional soldier addressing peers. "The Westwall Watchpost was built for thirty defenders facing conventional assault," Thorne began. "We had twenty-two combatants facing a force designed to breach walls through overwhelming numbers and specialized equipment."

His analysis was clinical, breaking down their defensive modifications, the psychological impact of their coordinated response, and the tactical decisions that had turned desperate improvisation into calculated defense.

"But tactics only work when people believe in them," Thorne concluded. "And that requires something beyond military training."

He looked to Aldwin, who rose with the quiet confidence that had steadied so many wounded souls. The healer spoke softly, but his voice carried clearly through the amphitheater.

"There are three battles in any siege," Aldwin said. "The one fought with weapons, which Captain Thorne has described. The one fought with medicine and magic, treating wounds and keeping fighters able to continue. But the third battle is the most important—it's fought in the heart, against despair."

He paused, his eyes moving across the audience. "A healer's greatest tool isn't a spell or a bandage. It's hope. Making people believe that survival is possible, that their sacrifice has meaning, that someone cares enough to fight for their life when they can no longer fight for themselves."

The amphitheater fell silent. This wasn't the clinical discussion of tactics they'd expected, but something more profound—a philosophy of warfare that acknowledged the human cost while affirming the possibility of triumph through community.

The applause, when it came, was sustained and thoughtful. In the audience, Marcus noted which nobles leaned forward with interest, which military officers nodded in recognition, and which scholars scribbled notes.

Later, as they walked through Waterdeep's evening streets, Veyra reflected on the day's impact.

"We're not just mercenaries anymore," she observed. "They're starting to see us as professionals with something to teach."

"Knowledge is currency in this city," Marcus agreed. "And you've just made your first significant deposit."

The hidden grove felt like stepping into another world, despite being just outside Waterdeep's walls. Ancient oak trees formed a living canopy overhead, their branches intertwining to create a natural cathedral that filtered the afternoon sunlight into dancing patterns of gold and green.

Veyra found herself breathing more deeply as she followed the winding path toward the healing pools, Aldwin beside her and Marcus trailing slightly behind. They'd debated bringing more Company members, but ultimately decided a smaller group would be less overwhelming for Vera in her current state.

"It's remarkable," Aldwin murmured, his healer's instincts clearly engaged. "I can feel the restoration energies even from here. No wonder the druids recommended this place for her recovery."

"Two and a half weeks should have been enough time to see significant improvement," Marcus added, though his tone suggested he was trying to convince himself as much as inform the others.

They emerged into a clearing where crystalline pools reflected the sky above, their surfaces disturbed by the gentle movement of fish and water plants. Vera sat on the edge of the largest pool, her legs dangling in the water, while Echo perched on her shoulder preening his midnight feathers. Near the smaller pools, they could see someone working quietly with aquatic plants—a figure with distinctive blue-green skin that shimmered in the dappled light.

"Welcome, friends of our patient," called a melodic voice. An elderly elf druid emerged from the tree line, his robes the color of living bark and his eyes holding the patient wisdom of centuries. "I am Elder Thornwick. Vera has been expecting you—her raven companion has been quite insistent about it."

"Has she now?" Veyra asked with a slight smile, catching the way Vera's posture had straightened at their arrival.

"Echo is remarkably communicative once you learn to interpret his patterns," Elder Thornwick replied with gentle humor. "Though I believe our water specialist has become quite fluent in his language." He gestured toward the figure by the pools.

As they approached, Veyra could see the improvements in Vera's condition immediately. The terrible hybrid-transformation wounds had healed cleanly, leaving only faint silver lines across her skin like natural markings. Her color was better, her breathing easier, and most importantly, the constant tension that had defined her since the Battle for Westwall had finally begun to ease.

"You look better," Veyra said, settling beside Vera on the pool's edge.

"I feel like myself again," Vera replied, flexing fingers that had been clawed and twisted just weeks before. "The druids here... they understand transformation trauma better than I expected. They've helped me understand what happened, why it went wrong, and how to prevent it in the future."

"That's excellent news," Aldwin said, settling cross-legged nearby with the comfortable presence of a healer assessing his patient. "Any lingering effects? Unexpected symptoms?"

"Some sensitivity to emotional extremes," Vera admitted. "If I get too angry or frightened, I can feel the wolf trying to surface. But Rill has been teaching me meditation techniques that help."

The figure working with the water plants looked up at the mention of her name—Rill Vossari, her sea-glass skin catching the light as she offered a knowing smile before returning to her work.

"I've been helping take care of you for weeks now," Rill said, her voice carrying the fluid cadence of someone comfortable with water's rhythms. "The emotional regulation is key to controlled transformation. The water helps—it reflects emotion without judgment, allows you to see patterns without being swept away by them."

Marcus shifted slightly, and Veyra caught the meaningful glance he directed toward her. They'd agreed to tell Vera about the Silent Hand situation, but seeing her still recovering made the burden of that knowledge feel heavier.

"Vera," Veyra said carefully, "we need to discuss Company business with you."

"Finally." Vera's relief was palpable. "I was beginning to think you'd decided to handle everything without me."

"We considered it," Marcus admitted. "Your recovery is the priority."

"My recovery includes feeling useful," Vera replied firmly. "What's happening with the Silent Hand investigation?"

Veyra exchanged glances with her companions. "The City Watch has... requested our assistance with a Silent Hand operation."

"Requested?" Vera's voice sharpened with the instincts of someone accustomed to reading between lines.

"Politely demanded," Marcus clarified. "Our provisional status comes with obligations. They've identified a facility they believe is central to the Silent Hand's operations, but their own attempts at gathering intelligence have failed."

Vera started to stand, but Veyra caught her arm gently. "You're staying here. Your healing isn't complete, and we can't risk another transformation incident in the middle of an operation."

"But this is my investigation!" Vera protested, though she allowed Veyra to guide her back to sitting. "I've been tracking the Silent Hand for seven years—ever since they took my brother. I know their patterns better than anyone." Her voice caught for just a moment before she steadied it. "Every trail I've followed, every lead I've chased... it's all been to find him. And now we're finally close."

"Which is exactly why we need your knowledge," Aldwin said gently. "But knowledge shared from a place of safety, not knowledge risked in the field."

Echo cawed softly and nuzzled against Vera's cheek, as if reinforcing the point. Vera sighed, her frustration clear but her logic apparently winning over her impulses.

"Tell me about the facility," she said, settling back into discussing strategy rather than demanding involvement.

Marcus pulled out the sketches Lady Blackwater had provided. "It's located about ten miles north of the city, near a small lake fed by two streams. Used to be a merchant's summer estate, now converted for their purposes."

Vera studied the sketches with the focus of someone whose life had been defined by tracking prey. "The water access... that's not just for scenery. They'd use it for transportation, moving captives without using the main roads."

"That was our thought as well," Veyra agreed. 

Rill had moved closer during the conversation, water still dripping from her hands. "May I?" she asked, gesturing toward the sketches.

At Veyra's nod, Rill studied the documents with intense concentration. "This configuration... the way the buildings relate to the water features... I know this place."

Everyone turned to look at her.

"Not personally," Rill clarified. "But the water systems in that area are... unusual. About fifteen years ago, there was extensive modification to the natural waterways. New channels, filtration systems, temperature controls. At the time, everyone assumed it was for aesthetic purposes—wealthy merchants do love their water features."

"But?" Marcus prompted.

"But the modifications went deeper than aesthetics. The water in that area carries traces of magical suppression compounds. Subtle ones, the kind that build up over time." Rill's expression grew troubled. "If they're using those water systems for containment..."

"They could keep magical captives powerless indefinitely," Vera finished, her voice tight with controlled anger.

"We need to understand more about this facility before we can plan any approach," Veyra said. "Rill, would you be willing to help us? Your knowledge of the water systems could be invaluable."

Rill looked at Vera, then back at Veyra. "I can do more than provide knowledge. If you need someone to analyze the magical signatures, to understand how their suppression systems work... I can help with that. From a safe distance, of course."

"This is dangerous," Veyra warned.

"So is doing nothing while children suffer," Rill replied with quiet determination.

The Briefing Circle in the main warehouse hummed with focused energy as the Last Light Company's core leadership gathered around the large map table, its surface covered in intelligence documents Grimsby had provided. The high windows cast long shadows across the vast space, while the distant sound of Grimjaw's hammer from the workshop building provided a rhythmic backdrop to their planning.

"Let's be clear about what we're facing," Veyra began, standing at the head of the table. "This isn't a typical slaver operation. This is sophisticated, organized, and specifically designed to contain magical individuals."

She glanced at the notes she'd taken during their visit to the Druid Grove earlier. "Vera and Rill have provided crucial intelligence about the water systems. The facility uses the lake and streams not just for access, but as part of their suppression network."

Thorne stepped forward, his military bearing bringing order to the discussion. "The facility is ten miles north of the city, built around a small lake with stream access. Multiple buildings, extensive grounds, and magical suppression systems we now understand far better than we did this morning."

Marcus took over, his voice low and measured. "Through a stroke of incredible fortune, we've had direct contact with one of the system's original architects: Cidrella Vexweld."

A murmur went through the room.

"We need specialized expertise to understand these defenses," Veyra said, studying the sketches. "The water systems, the magical suppression—this is beyond conventional infiltration."

Marcus leaned back in his chair. "We need someone who understands both magical theory and practical engineering. Someone who can look at these systems and tell us their weaknesses."

"The kind of person who could have designed them in the first place," Grimjaw added, his engineering mind already working through the problems.

"Exactly," Marcus said. "I'll reach out to my contacts, see if we can find an arcane engineer willing to consult. Discreetly, of course."

Veyra nodded, then surprised everyone with a slight smile. "Ten gold says whoever we need walks through our door before we find them."

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "That's oddly specific. Care to make it interesting?"

"If I win, you teach me that thing you did with the weighted dice at the Wayward Compass," Veyra said.

"I have no idea what you're talking about," Marcus replied with perfect innocence. "But if I win, you tell me the real story behind that scar on your shoulder—the one you claim is from a training accident."

They shook on it, while Thorne rolled his eyes. "We're planning an operation against child traffickers, and you're making bets?"

"Levity in darkness, Captain," Marcus replied. "It keeps us sane."

"That's..." Grimjaw paused from the back of the room, his engineering mind clearly working through the implications. "That's brilliant and horrible. You wouldn't need guards if the very environment keeps prisoners powerless."

"Exactly," Marcus confirmed. "And according to what Rill told us at the grove, the water carries traces of magical suppression compounds that build up over time. She can help us understand the signatures, but from a safe distance."

"Then we need a different approach," Veyra said. "We need to think about this systematically. What are our actual objectives?"

Fayne, who had been quietly taking notes, looked up. "Primary objective: gather intelligence on the facility's operations, defenses, and the number of captives. Secondary objective: identify weaknesses that could be exploited for a future rescue operation."

"And tertiary objective," Marcus added, "maintain operational security. If they realize they're being surveilled, they might accelerate their relocation timeline."

"Or worse," Veyra said, remembering Vera's warning from their grove visit. "They might kill the captives rather than risk them being rescued."

A heavy silence fell over the room.

"Then we proceed carefully," Veyra decided. "This isn't about immediate action. It's about gathering information, understanding what we're truly facing, and developing a plan that ensures success."

"With respect, Commander," Grimjaw said, "this sounds like the kind of operation that needs specialized expertise."

"We may have found our source for that expertise," Veyra said. "But we cannot approach Cid directly about this. Not yet. Our first step is to learn everything we can about her partner, Korrath. If he's as skilled as she says, he could be a vital asset."

Veyra looked around the table, seeing determination mixed with concern in every face. They all understood the stakes—children's lives hung in the balance. But they also understood that a failed rescue attempt could doom those same children.

"We have time," Marcus reminded them. "Lady Blackwater said they might relocate within the month. That gives us at least three weeks to gather intelligence properly."

"Over the coming weeks, we gather intelligence through every means available," Veyra announced. "When Vera's recovered enough to return, she'll coordinate with Rill to analyze the water systems from a safe distance. Marcus will investigate potential arcane engineers who might help us understand the defenses. The rest of us will prepare for what's to come."

"And what if the intelligence shows the facility is still beyond our capabilities?" Thorne asked.

"Then we find the capabilities we need," Veyra replied firmly. "Whatever it takes."

As the briefing concluded and the Company members dispersed to their various tasks, Veyra remained at the table, studying the sketches of the Silent Hand facility.

"Korrath," Marcus said quietly, having remained behind. "If he's her partner, he knows the system as well as she does. But we have no idea if he's aware of how his work is being used."

"I know," Veyra replied. "And that means we have to approach this with extreme care. We could be putting two innocent people in danger. For now, we focus on gathering information without making contact."

Outside the warehouse, the sounds of Waterdeep's evening settled into familiar rhythms. The interrogation had yielded crucial intelligence, but it had also shown the Company another side of their diplomatic companion—one that made them understand why Marcus Heartbridge was so valuable to their operations, and why he might be running from something in his own past.

But within the Last Light Company's headquarters, preparations had begun for what could be their most challenging mission yet.

They had at least three weeks to gather intelligence, develop a plan, and find a way to infiltrate a facility designed specifically to prevent rescue attempts. Time enough for Vera to complete her recovery, for Marcus to investigate Korrath, and for them to understand what they were truly facing.

The clock was ticking, but for once, they would not rush. Too much depended on getting this right.
