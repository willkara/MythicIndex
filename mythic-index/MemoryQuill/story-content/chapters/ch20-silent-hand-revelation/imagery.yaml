          Captain Grimsby's office serves as the stage for political theater. Morning
          sun casts long shadows through grimy windows. Lady Blackwater occupies the
          position of authority with practiced ease, spreading intelligence documents
          across the desk. Leather-bound volumes line bookcases, a crystal decanter of
          whiskey on the side table. The atmosphere shifts from administrative order
          to something more predatory as the briefing progresses.

          Sparse stone chamber beneath the administrative floors—table, two chairs,
          walls that press inward. The cold, stark room makes Marcus's intimate gestures
          all the more unsettling. Shackles bind the prisoner Brenner to his chair.
          Through the observation slit, Veyra watches the psychological warfare unfold.
          Dampness and cold contrast with the warmth of the offices above.

          Stone corridor outside the interrogation chamber. The moment the oak door
          closes, Marcus transforms—charming diplomat returned, adjusting his collar
          and cuffs as if nothing happened. Cold stone echoes with their footsteps
          as they process what they've witnessed.

          Grand academic amphitheater packed with military officers, City Watch brass,

          tactical maps illustrate the Westwall analysis. When Aldwin speaks of the
          third battle—the one fought in the heart against despair—the silence is
          profound. Academic grandeur provides unexpected platform for philosophy
          of hope.

          Hidden grove outside Waterdeep's walls, ancient oaks forming a living
          cathedral. Crystalline pools reflect the sky, surfaces disturbed by fish
          and water plants. Afternoon sunlight filters through in dancing patterns
          of gold and green. Vera sits at the largest pool's edge, transformation
          scars now faint silver lines. Rill works nearby with aquatic plants. The
          grove represents healing, both physical and emotional—a stark contrast
          to the cold stone of the Watch headquarters.

      Marcus Heartbridge stands beside a shackled prisoner in a sparse stone interrogation
      chamber. His elegant hand is placed over Brenner's white-knuckled fist with
      unshakable firmness—a gesture shockingly intimate against the cold, stark room.
      Marcus leans close, whispering beside the prisoner's ear. Brenner is frozen, pinned
      by a touch that is not violent but absolute. The stone walls seem to press inward.
      Harsh overhead light casts deep shadows, making the intimacy feel threatening.
      Marcus's expression is calm, calculating—the charming diplomat has become cold
      predator.
