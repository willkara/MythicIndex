    scene_variations: |
      This chapter: Late night administrative work. Thorne is seated at his desk, not in full patrol armor. He wears his faded deep blue wool cloak with the golden sunburst sigil over a blue linen tunic. His scarred hands hold a quill rather than weapons. His longsword and shield rest on a stand nearby—clean, ready, deliberately set aside.

          A small, functional military office carved from industrial warehouse space on an upper mezzanine level. Wooden desk dominates the cramped space, currently drowning under mountains of bureaucratic parchment. Clean longsword and polished shield rest on a simple wooden stand against one wall. Single iron lantern on desk. Shadows fill corners and press against small window showing harbor darkness.

    visual_description: |
      Captain Thorne Brightward sits at his desk, surrounded by a mountain of paper. His shoulders are hunched, scarred hands gripping a quill like a weapon. In the background, his longsword and shield stand clean and ready—tools of clear purpose, deliberately idle. Single lantern casts warm amber light across his weathered face and gray mustache.
    composition_notes: |
      Rule of thirds: Thorne left of center, weapons rack right third. Slightly low angle to emphasize the weight. Depth from sharp foreground to softer background.

      Veyra stands in the mezzanine office doorway, her silhouette framed by the dim warehouse light.

Her expression is one of soft concern and understanding.

      Fayne standing in the mezzanine office doorway, their silhouette framed by the dim warehouse. They are looking at Thorne with a knowing, almost mischievous expression. Thorne is gesturing tiredly at his mountain of paper with a nearly empty coffee mug. The irony of the 'professional' failing at paperwork is the core beat.
    composition_notes: |
