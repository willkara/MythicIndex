        chapter_context: |
          Cramped into a former storage room, barely large enough for anvil and
          furnace. Grimjaw must duck through the doorway, has singed his beard
          on low-hanging cooling chains. Dawn light barely penetrates; the space
          glows primarily from forge fire. Soot deposits near the flue, strong
          ventilation through ridge vents. The three measured hammer strikes at
          dawn have become the compound's heartbeat, announcing the day's start.

      - id: "mess-hall"
        chapter_context: |
          Once seemed ample, now cramped with bodies pressed shoulder to shoulder.
          The extended table wobbles dangerously, assembled from mismatched boards.
          Some eat from repurposed measuring cups because bowls ran out. Frost
          patterns on windows at pre-dawn, dying ember glow from great hearth.
          Warm chaos of found family, acoustic warmth despite overcrowding.

      - id: "infirmary"
        chapter_context: |
          Little more than a curtained corner of the barracks. Campaign tent wall
          provides no sound privacy. Treatment table is a door balanced on sawhorses.
          Herbs stored in wine bottles, emptied ink jars, a repurposed helmet.
          Three oil lamps positioned at angles create working light but add smoke.
          Aldwin and Halden must coordinate movements to avoid collision.

      - id: "courtyard"
        chapter_context: |
          Perhaps thirty feet square with uneven cobblestones that must be memorized
          to avoid turned ankles. Barely room for three people to spar without
          hitting walls. Slanting winter sun, shadows creeping early. Tiny four-foot
          patch of earth is the only tracking training ground. Grimjaw has memorized
          every settled cobblestone for spatial combat advantage.

      - id: "barracks"
        chapter_context: |
          Bunks pushed together, now stacked three tiers high to accommodate
          growing numbers. Gear creates obstacle course in pre-dawn darkness.
          Venn has hit his head eighteen times on the new upper bunk. Fayne
          sketches by candlelight, documenting everything. Little floor space,
          every piece of equipment a potential hazard.

      - id: "parapet"
        chapter_context: |
          Highest point of the watchtower, accessed by forty-three worn stone
          steps with a failing rope handrail. Veyra's thinking place, the only
          spot where she can be alone with thoughts. Commanding view of sunset-
          gold countryside, activity visible in courtyard below. Stars emerging
          as evening falls, wolf howls in the distance.

      Grimjaw stands at his anvil in the cramped forge, hammer raised for the first
      strike of morning. His stocky silhouette is backlit by the orange glow of the
      freshly stoked furnace. Iron-gray beard braided with metal charms catches the
      firelight. The forge room is tight—he fills most of the space, low chains
      hanging near his head, soot-blackened walls pressing close. Through the narrow
      doorway behind him, cold gray dawn light seeps in. The moment before the hammer
      falls—the held breath of a community about to wake.

      Medium shot, Grimjaw framed by the doorway and forge. Forge-orange glow from
      right illuminates his profile, cold dawn gray from left creates contrast.
      Hammer at apex of swing is focal point. Vertical emphasis from low ceiling
      and chains creates sense of cramped space. Rule of thirds places Grimjaw
      at left intersection, forge fire at right.

      The mess hall overflows with bodies. Company members sit shoulder to shoulder
      around a wobbling extended table made of mismatched boards. Grimjaw's broad
      shoulders press against the wall; he's given up fitting on the bench and stands
      to eat. Some hold measuring cups instead of bowls. Vera perches near the
      frost-patterned window, Echo on her shoulder. Morning light streams through,
      catching steam rising from porridge. Veyra sits at the table's head, watching
      her people with rare unguarded contentment. The great hearth glows behind them.

      Aldwin and Halden work in their curtained corner infirmary. The campaign-tent
      curtain hangs behind them, providing no real privacy. Aldwin's herbs are stored
      in old wine bottles, emptied ink jars, and a repurposed helmet lined up on a
      bowing shelf. The treatment table—a door balanced on sawhorses—holds Halden's
      precisely arranged surgical instruments. Three oil lamps at different angles
      create working light but add smoke to the close air. The halfling grinds herbs
      in a worn mortar while Halden organizes supplies, their movements coordinated
      to avoid collision in the cramped space.

      golden sky. The worn stone battlements frame them, ancient and enduring.
      Below, the courtyard activity is visible—tiny figures going about evening
      routines, smoke rising from the forge, lantern light beginning to appear
      in windows. The western hills are painted gold and rose by the dying light.
      Stars begin to emerge in the deepening blue above. Their shoulders almost
      touch in the narrow space between merlons. This is the view of commanders
      surveying what they've built and what they must become.

      Ultra-wide hero shot, horizontal emphasis. Veyra and Thorne silhouetted
      at center-left, sunset at right creating natural gradient. Battlements
      frame bottom of composition. Courtyard activity below provides context.
      Stars emerging above add temporal depth. The intimacy of their stance
      contrasts with the vast view.

        Silhouetted against sunset, scarred hands gripping stone battlements.
        Dark mohawk profile distinctive against gold sky. Scarred face in
        profile, contemplative. Lantern at hip catches last light.
      thorne-brightward: |
        Standing beside her, shoulder almost touching. Steel-gray cropped
        hair visible in silhouette. Blue cloak catching sunset color.
        Posture of comfortable partnership—fifteen years of discipline
        relaxed in this private moment.

      Two figures silhouetted on medieval watchtower parapet at sunset,
      half-elf woman with distinctive mohawk profile and human man in cloak,
      shoulders almost touching between ancient stone merlons.
      Ultra-wide cinematic shot, western hills painted gold and rose,
      stars emerging in deepening blue sky above, courtyard activity
      visible below with forge smoke and lantern light appearing.
      Commanders surveying their domain, leadership at sunset.
      Subtle fantasy: faint ward-glow on battlements, lantern at woman's hip.

    visual_description: |
      Looking down from the parapet, the courtyard spreads below in evening light.
      Finn leads horses to the stable, speaking gently to them. Mistress Elba
      shakes out dishcloths at the kitchen door. Grimjaw banks the forge fire,
      orange glow visible through the doorway. Aldwin gathers herbs from his
      window boxes before frost damage. Vera sits on the stable roof with Echo,
      finding solitude. The scene is alive with routine, with purpose, with the
      small moments that make a home. Lantern light begins to glow in windows.
      Veyra's hand is visible at frame edge, gripping the battlements as she
      watches.
    composition_notes: |
      High angle looking down at courtyard. Multiple figures engaged in evening
      tasks create visual rhythm. Forge glow provides warm accent at right.
      Window lights emerging create pattern. Veyra's hand at frame edge connects
      viewer to her perspective. Depth from parapet to courtyard floor.

      High angle view looking down from parapet at medieval courtyard at evening,
      figures engaged in routine tasks below—stable boy with horses, cook at door,
      dwarf banking forge fire visible through doorway, halfling gathering herbs,
      ranger on stable roof with raven.
      Scarred hand visible at frame edge gripping stone battlements.
      Warm forge glow and emerging window lantern light against cooling blue evening,
      smoke rising from forge, community in motion.
      Subtle fantasy: ward-glow on battlements, mixed ancestries visible in figures.
