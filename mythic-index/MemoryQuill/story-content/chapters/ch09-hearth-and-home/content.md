The mess hall held the chill of winter's dying breath, its stone walls exhaling the night's cold in slow, visible puffs that drifted like ghosts in the darkness. Only the dying embers in the great hearth provided light, casting long shadows that danced across the rough-hewn tables, their surfaces scarred by years of use. Frost had formed on the inside of the windows overnight, creating delicate patterns that would vanish with the first touch of morning sun.

Veyra sat with her back to the fire, though its warmth barely reached her. A collection of maps spread before her like battle plans, their edges weighted down with whatever came to hand—a knife here, a salt cellar there. Her scarred fingers traced routes through the surrounding countryside, marking potential trouble spots with small notations, escape routes with dotted lines, places where the company might be needed with careful circles. The ink was slow to dry in the cold air.

Thorne entered without ceremony, his boots barely whispering against the stone floor—three months of working together had taught him to move quietly in her presence during these early hours. She valued the silence, the space to think before the day's chaos began. He carried two steaming mugs, the scent of bitter tea cutting through the cold air, and set one beside her elbow without comment. The warmth radiated through the ceramic, a small comfort against the morning chill.

"The eastern road's been quiet too long," Veyra said, not looking up from the maps. Her breath still misted slightly in the cold air.

"Grimsby's been patrolling it twice weekly." Thorne settled into the chair across from her, wrapping his hands around his own mug to warm them. "His reports show nothing unusual. No missing caravans, no complaints from the merchants."

"That's what worries me." She finally lifted her eyes to meet his, and in them he saw the constant vigilance that never quite left her, even here in their sanctuary. "Quiet roads in winter make me think of ambushes. Predators waiting for prey to relax."

The sound of heavy footsteps on stone broke their contemplation—not the measured tread of a soldier but the purposeful bustle of someone with too much to do and not enough space to do it in. Mistress Elba shouldered through the kitchen doorway, her arms loaded with bundles from the morning market that she could barely see over. She was a stout woman whose efficiency masked a warm heart, though she'd sooner admit to harboring demons than to any sentimental attachment to the company.

"Morning, Commander. Captain." She nodded to each in turn, then immediately began unpacking her supplies with sharp, purposeful movements. But there was a problem—the small preparation table was already full of yesterday's deliveries that hadn't been properly stored. She made a sound of frustration, setting bags on the floor, on chairs, anywhere she could find space.

"Though I'll tell you both," she said, her voice carrying fond exasperation as she tried to organize the chaos, "this pantry's becoming a right nightmare. Can barely fit a week's worth of stores in there now, what with feeding all your specialists. Used to be I could stock for a month without trouble. Now? I'm juggling sacks of grain like a street performer, and yesterday a bag of onions fell on poor Finn's head when he opened the door."

As if summoned by the mention, Finn appeared in the kitchen doorway looking sheepish, one hand rubbing the back of his head. "About the onions—"

"They ambushed you," Elba said without looking up from her reorganization attempts. "I saw. Tried to warn you the door was booby-trapped, but you were too busy talking to the chickens."

"They seemed agitated! I wanted to make sure—wait, booby-trapped?"

"Figure of speech, lad. Though at this rate, I might actually have to start setting traps to keep people from opening doors without proper caution. Yesterday it was onions. This morning I found turnips stacked six high, balanced like some kind of vegetable tower of terror. One sneeze and we'd have been knocked unconscious by root vegetables."

Thorne's lips twitched. "Death by turnip. An unusual way to go."

"Mock all you want, Captain. You haven't seen Bertha."

Veyra paused in her map-folding. "Bertha?"

Elba gestured toward the pantry with an air of grim satisfaction. "Largest turnip I've ever seen. She's been with me since Waterdeep. Survived three moves, two kitchen fires, and one incident with Grimjaw that we don't discuss. Named her for sentiment, but she's also excellent for propping open the grain sacks. Multi-purpose vegetable, Bertha."

Finn looked genuinely concerned. "You've... named the turnips?"

"Just the big one. The others don't have personality yet."

Veyra folded the maps with careful precision. "We're eating too much?"

"No, lass, you're _growing_ too much." Elba's voice carried warmth despite her complaints. She held up a jar of preserves, turning it this way and that, clearly trying to figure out where to squeeze it in among the already overcrowded shelves visible through the pantry door. "Started with five guardsmen who ate like sparrows. Now I've got a dwarf who could empty half the pantry himself on a good day, a halfling who requests seventeen different herbs for his teas—and where am I supposed to store seventeen different herbs?—and that new tracker girl who brings me rabbits at odd hours expecting me to know what to do with them. Yesterday she brought three. Three! Where exactly should I hang three rabbits when the meat hooks are already full?"

Thorne caught Veyra's eye over his mug, a slight smile tugging at his lips. "Growing pains."

"Growing's the word for it." Elba continued her inventory, now resorting to stacking items in precarious towers that defied architectural logic. She shook her head at a sack of oats that simply wouldn't fit anywhere. "Mark my words, we'll need proper storage soon, or you'll find yourselves eating nothing but porridge and good intentions. And that's if the porridge doesn't go bad because I've nowhere cool and dry to store it properly."

The first sound of the day was always Grimjaw's hammer. Three measured strikes on the anvil, each one ringing clear in the cold morning air—his way of greeting the dawn and announcing that the forge was lit. The rhythm carried through the watchtower's stone corridors like a gentle bell, stirring the sleeping into wakefulness. It had become the heartbeat of their morning, as reliable as sunrise itself.

In the small chamber he'd claimed near the armory—small being generous, as he could barely stand upright without his head brushing the ceiling—Brother Aldwin Gentleheart sat cross-legged on his narrow bed. His eyes were closed in morning meditation, lips moving silently through familiar prayers. His hands rested on knees that had seen decades of kneeling beside the wounded and dying, joints that ached more in the cold these days.

The window box beside him overflowed with carefully tended herbs—what little pharmacy he could manage in the limited space. Some hung drying from nails he'd hammered into the wall, others crowded in small pots on every available surface. The earthy scents of lavender, sage, and feverfew mixed with the morning air, but underneath was a note of worry. Several herbs were wilting despite his best efforts; they needed more sun than the small window provided, more space than the cramped box allowed. His healing supplies were scattered across three different locations because there simply wasn't room to store them properly together.

Three floors above, in what had once been a watch tower and now served as her aerie, Vera Moonwhisper was already dressed and moving through the courtyard below like a ghost. Echo rode her shoulder, the raven's dark eyes scanning the same shadows his mistress examined. The morning ritual had become routine—first the horses, running experienced hands along their legs and checking their hooves for stones or ice damage. She noticed the stable was overcrowded, three horses to a stall meant for two. Finn had done his best, but the animals were restless, nipping at each other in the close quarters.

Then to the message ravens in their coop, counting them twice, checking for any signs of illness that could spread quickly in the confined space. Finally, she paused by the small vegetable garden Aldwin had started against the south wall—a patch barely large enough to deserve the name, wedged between the wall and the practice yard. She noted which plants had grown overnight, which showed signs of pest damage, which were struggling in the poor soil that was more stone than earth. Her ranger's instincts catalogued everything, filing away concerns about their limited resources.

In the main barracks, where bunks had been pushed closer together to accommodate new members, Corporal Darric groaned as consciousness returned. His foot had gone numb where it pressed against the wall—they'd had to turn his bunk sideways to fit Vera's gear locker in the room.

"Venn, you're snoring like a bloody dragon again," he complained, rubbing feeling back into his toes.

"Was not." Archer Venn's protest was muffled by his pillow. "Dragons don't snore. They rumble majestically."

"Tell that to my sleep. And tell it to whoever keeps leaving their boots where I can trip over them in the dark." This was a real problem—with so little floor space, every piece of equipment became an obstacle course in the pre-dawn darkness.

"That would be Halden," Venn replied, finally sitting up and immediately banging his head on the bunk above him—another recent addition to accommodate their growing numbers. "Ow! Bloody—when did that get so low?"

"When we added the third tier," Fayne called from his corner bunk. He was already awake, sketching by candlelight. "Two weeks ago. You've hit your head seventeen times since then."

Venn rubbed his skull ruefully. "You're counting?"

"I'm a quartermaster. I count everything. Also, you curse differently each time. It's fascinating from a linguistic perspective."

"Seventeen," Venn muttered. "Seventeen times..."

"Eighteen," Fayne corrected as Venn stood up too quickly and struck his head again on the upper bunk's frame.

Darric snorted into his pillow. "At this rate, we'll need Aldwin to check you for brain damage."

"I'm developing spatial awareness," Venn protested, sitting back down carefully. "Eventually my body will remember there's a ceiling above my head."

"Eventually," Fayne agreed, making a note in his journal. "Though at the current rate of impact, I estimate you'll adapt in approximately... six more weeks. Assuming you don't knock yourself unconscious first."

"You're not helping."

"I'm documenting. There's a difference."

By the time the sun crested the watchtower's eastern wall, painting the frost-covered stones gold, they had all gathered in the mess hall. The quiet of dawn gave way to the warm chaos of a found family sharing breakfast, though the space that had once seemed ample now felt cramped with bodies pressed shoulder to shoulder on the benches.

"Someone needs to tell Finn that the horses don't need apples every single time he walks past the stable," Darric said around a mouthful of porridge, having to lean back to avoid elbowing Venn as he ate.

"Let the lad spoil them." Grimjaw's voice carried the rough warmth of forge-heated steel. "Good horses'll get you home when nothing else will. Though we need to do something about the stable. Three to a stall is making them ornery."

"Speaking of getting home," Venn said, trying to cut his bread without hitting Darric's mug, "did anyone else notice how quiet the roads have been? Hardly any travelers these past few days."

Vera looked up from her careful dissection of an apple, a habit from her solitary years when every bite of food was rationed. "The merchant routes are shifting south. There's been bandit activity on the King's Road near Amphail. The winter caravans are taking the longer route to avoid trouble."

"How do you know that?" Fayne asked with genuine curiosity, though he had to speak up to be heard over the clatter of too many people in too small a space.

"The ravens talk." She gestured toward the window where Echo sat preening, ice crystals still glittering on his feathers. "Not just mine. All of them. They see everything from above."

Veyra watched this exchange from the head of the long table—or what served as the head, though the table itself was a mismatched collection of boards that had been extended twice already and wobbled dangerously if anyone leaned too hard. Her expression was unguarded in a way it rarely was during daylight hours. Here, surrounded by the easy banter of her people, she allowed herself a moment of something approaching contentment. Though she noticed how people had to squeeze past each other to reach their seats, how Grimjaw's broad shoulders barely fit between the bench and the wall, how they'd run out of proper bowls and some were eating from repurposed measuring cups.

"Aldwin," she said, "how's our injured guardsman from last week?"

"Healing well. The cut was clean, no signs of infection." The halfling's gentle voice carried easily across the table despite the crowded acoustics. "Though he's been having some difficulty sleeping. Nightmares about the attack. And we've had to move him twice—there's simply no quiet space for proper recovery. Every time someone walks through the barracks, he startles awake."

Thorne nodded grimly. "Highway robbery's getting bolder. They used crossbows this time. We'll need a proper infirmary if we keep taking in wounded. Somewhere quiet, with room for multiple patients."

"I've prepared a tea that should help with the sleep terrors," Aldwin continued. "Valerian root, chamomile, a touch of lavender. But he'll need more than herbs if he's to truly heal from what he saw. He needs peace, quiet, a space where his mind can rest as well as his body."

"That's what we're here for," Veyra said simply. "All of it. The wounds you can see and the ones you can't."

The conversation continued around the table, plans being made, stories being shared, the small jokes and gentle ribbing that marked a group of people who trusted each other. But underneath it all, Veyra found herself cataloguing problems: Elba's complaints about storage, Aldwin's wilting herbs, Fayne's cramped workspace, the way people had to coordinate their movements just to navigate the room. She watched Halden accidentally knock over Venn's mug reaching for salt, saw Vera have to stand and squeeze against the wall to let Kelen pass, noticed how Grimjaw had given up trying to fit properly on the bench and now stood to eat.

They were outgrowing their borrowed home, and it was happening faster than she'd anticipated.

The walk from the mess hall to the makeshift infirmary required navigating three flights of narrow stairs and a corridor so tight that two people couldn't pass without one pressing against the wall. Halden had already bumped his medical bag against the stone twice, and one of his glass vials had a new crack he'd have to tend to later.

The infirmary itself was little more than a curtained corner of the barracks, carved out of space that had once been storage. The curtain—a repurposed campaign tent wall—did nothing to muffle the sounds of daily life: boots on stone, weapons practice in the yard, the constant murmur of voices. Privacy was a luxury they couldn't afford in their current quarters.

Halden had done his best to make it functional. His surgical instruments lay in precise rows on a cloth-covered table—really a door balanced on two sawhorses, as all the actual tables were needed elsewhere. Each instrument was meticulously cleaned and positioned for quick access, though he'd had to nail small strips of wood to the edges to keep them from rolling off the uneven surface. The winter light filtering through the narrow window was thin and gray, blocked partially by the buildings that pressed close on all sides. He'd positioned three oil lamps at careful angles to illuminate his work space, though the smoke from them made the already close air harder to breathe.

Aldwin worked across the small area—so close that they had to coordinate their movements to avoid collision—grinding dried herbs in a worn mortar. The pestle moved in steady circles, breaking down roots and leaves into the fine powder he needed for his poultices and teas. The sound was rhythmic, almost meditative, though occasionally interrupted when one of them had to squeeze past the other.

"Brother," Halden said, pausing in his organization as he tried to find space for new supplies that had arrived that morning, "with respect, a standard-issue clotting bandage would have sealed that guardsman's cut by now. Is that mixture truly more effective?"

The grinding didn't stop, but Aldwin's eyes lifted to meet the younger medic's gaze. "The bandage closes the skin, lad. This," he gestured to his carefully organized herbs, most of which were stored in whatever containers he could scrounge—old wine bottles, emptied ink jars, a repurposed helmet, "helps with the tremor in his hand when he thinks no one is looking."

Halden frowned, genuine curiosity replacing any challenge in his voice. "Tremor? I didn't notice—"

"You notice everything about a wound. That's good. Necessary." Aldwin set down the pestle and began dividing the powder into small portions, though he had to clear space on the overcrowded shelf first, carefully moving bottles that threatened to topple. "I learned to notice everything about the person carrying it."

"I don't follow."

The halfling's weathered hands moved with practiced efficiency, though he had to work around the constraints of their cramped space. His voice took on the cadence of memory. "Twenty-three years ago, there was a skirmish near Daggerford. Nothing grand enough for the history books, just a company of Zhents trying to raid a caravan. I patched up a young soldier—boy, really—who'd taken a sword cut across his palm. Clean wound, closed it neat as you please, sent him back to his unit."

Halden listened intently, his own work forgotten. He leaned against the wall—the only way to find a comfortable position in the narrow space.

"Three days later, that same boy put an arrow through a civilian's chest during what should have been a simple camp inspection." Aldwin's voice remained gentle, but something harder entered his eyes. "Turned out the cut had been on his sword hand. Every time he tried to grip his weapon, the fresh scar pulled tight. Made him nervous. Made him quick to violence because he feared his grip would fail."

"You couldn't have known—"

"Couldn't I?" The older healer began measuring herbs into small cloth pouches, though he had to stack them precariously as his storage box was already full. "I got very good at saving lives, Halden. Battlefield medicine teaches you to work fast, to prioritize, to make hard choices. It took me twenty years to learn how to save a _person_. To see not just the injury but the life it affects."

The words hung in the cold air between them, made closer by the confined space. Halden set down the instrument he'd been cleaning and really looked at their surroundings—the thin curtain that provided no real privacy, patients' groans audible to everyone in the barracks. The improvised lighting that left too many shadows, making delicate work dangerous. The herbs crowded into whatever containers Aldwin could scrounge, some going bad because they couldn't be stored properly. The lack of clean water nearby, requiring trips to the kitchen for every procedure.

"The Watch training focuses on returning a soldier to duty," Halden said slowly. "Get them patched up, get them back in line. Not on what comes after."

"And there's value in that. Essential value." Aldwin's approval was evident in his tone. "You've got steady hands and a clear head under pressure. You can work in chaos, make life-or-death decisions in heartbeats. Those are gifts not everyone possesses. I've seen you stitch a wound while arrows flew overhead—that takes rare courage."

"But?"

"But healing doesn't end when the bleeding stops." The halfling gestured around their cramped quarters, nearly knocking over a bottle with his sleeve. "Look at this place. To do my job right, I need space for proper preparation, somewhere quiet where a soul can rest without the whole barracks hearing their night terrors. Clean surfaces for brewing remedies, not this." He indicated the water-stained wood, the mold creeping in one corner despite their best efforts. "And you—" He nodded toward Halden's carefully arranged instruments, several of which had rust spots from the damp. "You need better light, proper storage that keeps your tools dry and sharp, a sterile environment where you can work without dust and foot traffic compromising your efforts."

As if to emphasize his point, someone walked past outside the curtain, their shadow falling across Halden's workspace and momentarily plunging it into darkness. The footsteps were heavy—probably Grimjaw—and dust filtered down from the ceiling boards, settling on the clean cloth covering the instruments.

Halden's gaze swept their shared corner, seeing it now through professional eyes rather than making do with what they had. The patient cot wedged so close to the wall that he could only work from one side. The medicine shelf bowing under weight it wasn't meant to bear. The basin of water that had to be changed constantly because there was nowhere to drain it properly.

"This isn't enough, is it?"

"No, lad. It's not. We're trying to practice the healing arts in a broom closet. Our patients deserve better. We deserve better. The Company deserves better."

They worked in companionable silence after that, though it was punctuated by the awkward dance of two men trying to work in a space meant for one. Each lost in his own thoughts about what real medicine required. And what they currently lacked.

The morning's chill had burned off under a pale winter sun, leaving the courtyard dry enough for training—though "courtyard" was a generous term for the narrow space between buildings that they'd claimed for practice. It was perhaps thirty feet square, with uneven cobblestones that had to be memorized to avoid turning an ankle during combat drills.

Darric and Venn had claimed a patch of ground near the armory—really just a reinforced door to a storage room where weapons were stacked like cordwood. They went through sword drills with the methodical precision of professional soldiers, though they had to be careful not to strike the walls on their backswings. Yesterday, Venn had put a chip in the stone that Tomaq had noticed with displeasure.

Grimjaw emerged from the forge, wiping soot from his hands on a leather apron that had seen better decades. The forge itself was cramped into what had been a storage room, barely large enough for the anvil and furnace. He had to duck through the doorway, and more than once he'd singed his beard on the low-hanging chains he used to suspend pieces for cooling. He paused to watch their practice, his experienced eye noting technique and form.

"Not bad," he called out. "Though you're telegraphing that overhead strike, Darric. And Venn, stop trying to avoid the puddle—in real combat, you won't have that luxury."

The corporal lowered his practice sword and grinned, though he was breathing hard in the confined space where the air didn't circulate properly. "Easy enough to critique from the sidelines, old-timer."

"Old-timer?" Grimjaw's eyebrows rose, and there was a dangerous glint in his eye that Venn recognized immediately.

"Darric," the archer said quickly, "maybe we should—"

"No, no," Grimjaw said, setting down his apron and rolling his shoulders. The movement made his presence fill the small yard even more. "The lad's got a point. These old bones have seen better days." He picked up one of the practice swords from the rack—which was really just pegs hammered into the wall—testing its weight and balance. "Must be twenty years since I've done proper sparring. Course, that was in spaces where you could swing a blade without risking a concussion from the walls."

"Grimjaw, I didn't mean—"

"Course you did. And you're not wrong." The dwarf settled into a fighting stance that looked deceptively casual, though he had to adjust it for the uneven cobblestones. "Question is, do you think twenty years is enough to make me forget what I learned in the forty before that?"

Darric and Venn exchanged glances, settling into ready positions. From the sidelines, Fayne had pulled out his ever-present journal, already sketching the scene.

"Darric's stance is off," Grimjaw observed before anyone moved. "Weight distribution is sixty-five percent forward, thirty-five percent back. Should be closer to fifty-fifty for that cobblestone positioning. You're standing on the section that settled three degrees lower than the surrounding area. First hard strike and you'll compensate wrong."

Darric looked down at his feet, then at the apparently level ground. "How can you possibly—"

"The mortar joints." Grimjaw tapped his boot on the cobblestone. "See how this one's settled? Water damage underneath. I noticed it my second day here when I was setting up the forge. Had to account for the slope when I positioned the anvil—if it's off by more than two degrees, hammer strikes distribute force unevenly."

Venn blinked. "You're applying *forge geometry* to combat?"

"Lad, it's all the same. Force, angle, weight distribution, structural weak points." The dwarf shifted his own stance slightly. "Your overhead strike comes in at approximately forty-five degrees from vertical. Optimal angle for maximum force, poor angle for this confined space. You've got maybe thirty inches of clearance to that wall. Your sword's thirty-two inches. Do the mathematics."

Venn glanced at the wall behind him, then at his sword, then back at Grimjaw with dawning realization. "I'd hit the wall on my backswing."

"Aye. And then you'd be off-balance, overextended, and I'd have you. Combat in confined spaces is all about load-bearing calculations and force vectors, just like engineering. Your body's the structure, your sword's the applied force, and the environment provides constraints." He grinned. "Now, shall we test my theory?"

"That's terrifying," Fayne muttered to no one in particular, scribbling notes. "He's turned combat into mathematical proof."

"He's also absolutely right," Vera observed from her perch on the wall, Echo cawing what might have been agreement.

What followed was less a spar and more a lesson in applied physics and spatial awareness. Grimjaw moved with the economy of someone who had long ago learned that strength meant nothing without precision, that speed was worthless without timing. When Darric came in with his overhead strike, the dwarf simply wasn't there anymore—a sidestep of perhaps six inches, all the space he had to work with. When Venn tried to capitalize on what looked like an opening, he found his sword turned aside and himself off-balance, nearly crashing into the wall.

The entire demonstration took place in a space barely large enough for three men to stand comfortably, which made it all the more impressive. Grimjaw used the confined quarters to his advantage, forcing the younger men to overextend, to lose their footing on cobblestones they hadn't memorized like he had in his morning forge work.

It lasted perhaps thirty seconds. When it was over, both younger men were on the ground—not hurt, but thoroughly outmaneuvered—and Grimjaw stood over them with barely a hair out of place, though he did have to catch himself against the wall when Darric's fall nearly took his legs out from under him.

"The old ways still have teeth, lads," he said, offering each a hand up. "Experience counts for something. Especially when you don't have room to dance around like peacocks."

The respect in their eyes when they looked at him afterward was worth more than any words. Though Venn did mutter, "Next time, can we find a bigger yard?"

On the other side of the courtyard—all of fifteen feet away—Vera knelt beside a patch of bare earth that she'd cleared near the wall. It was the only spot that got decent sun, though it was barely four feet square. She was pointing out track patterns to a surprisingly attentive Fayne, who had to crouch awkwardly to see what she was showing him without blocking the light.

"See how the heel strike is deeper on the left foot?" She indicated a bootprint in the small patch of dirt. "That suggests an old injury, probably to the right leg. The person favors it unconsciously."

Fayne nodded, sketching quickly in his journal, though he had to hold it at an angle to avoid hitting Vera with his elbow. "And the spacing between steps?"

"Tells you about their urgency. These are measured, careful. Someone taking their time, not running from anything." Vera brushed dirt from a particularly clear print. "But look at the toe placement. See how it angles slightly outward? That's someone used to moving quietly through underbrush. The stance keeps twigs from catching on your legs."

"How do you see all that?" Fayne asked with genuine admiration.

Vera glanced up at him, something like surprise flickering across her features. "How do you see the perfect angle for a grappling hook just by looking at a wall?"

"Practice. Training. My father—" Fayne stopped abruptly, then continued in a quieter voice. "My father was a poacher, before I joined the Watch. You learn to see what others miss when putting food on the table depends on it."

Understanding passed between them, the recognition of shared experience that crossed different specialties. Vera nodded slowly. "The eye that sees patterns is the same, whether it's reading tracks or designing tools. Most people look but don't observe."

"Exactly." Fayne's sketch captured not just the footprint but the story it told. "You'd be surprised how many times I've solved a logistics problem by watching how water flows around obstacles, or how a spider builds its web. Though it would be easier if I had a proper workspace to test these ideas. Right now I'm building prototypes on my bunk."

They worked together for another hour, until the shadow of the building swallowed their small patch of earth completely. Vera shared woodcraft knowledge while Fayne showed her how an artist's training in perspective could help judge distances and angles in tracking. By the time they finished, both had gained not just skills but respect for the other's expertise—and a shared frustration at the limitations their cramped quarters imposed on their work.

The sun was setting behind the western hills when Veyra climbed the narrow stairs to the watchtower's highest platform. The stairs themselves were a hazard—worn smooth by centuries of use, too narrow for anyone in armor, with a rope that served as a handrail threatening to give way at any moment. She'd counted the steps so many times she could climb them in total darkness: forty-three to the first landing, thirty-seven to the second, twenty-eight to the top.

The parapet offered a commanding view of the surrounding countryside—fields and forests, roads and distant villages, all painted gold by the dying light. It was her thinking place, where she came to process the day and plan for tomorrow. It was also the only place in the entire compound where she could be alone with her thoughts, where the press of bodies and needs could fade for just a moment.

She wasn't surprised when Thorne's boots sounded on the stone steps behind her. After months of partnership, their rhythms had synchronized in ways that went beyond the merely professional. He knew when she needed solitude and when she needed another perspective. Tonight was the latter.

"How did the logistics meeting go?" she asked without turning around, her hands resting on the ancient stone of the battlements.

"About as well as expected." Thorne moved to stand beside her, his shoulder almost touching hers in the narrow space between merlons. "Kelen's concerned about our supply situation. We're going through equipment faster than we can replace it, and storage is becoming a serious issue. He showed me the armory—we've got weapons stacked on weapons, no room to properly maintain them. Rust is becoming a problem."

"And Halden?"

"Thinks our current medical setup is unsustainable. Too cramped, too public, not sterile enough for serious surgery." Thorne's voice carried the weight of difficult decisions ahead. "He's not wrong, Veyra. None of them are. We had another injury today—Darric's recruit twisted his ankle on those damned cobblestones. Halden had to treat him in the hallway because the infirmary was occupied."

Below them, the courtyard bustled with the activity of a community settling into evening routines. Finn led the horses to their stable, speaking to each animal in the gentle tones he reserved for creatures he cared about, though his voice carried a note of apology—he knew they were cramped, unhappy with their quarters. Mistress Elba emerged from the kitchen to shake out dishcloths, muttering under her breath about cramped pantries and impossible requests.

Grimjaw was banking his forge fire for the night, a process that took longer than it should because he had to move half his tools just to reach the furnace properly. Aldwin gathered herbs from his window boxes before the frost could damage them, though half the plants were already failing from lack of sun and space.

"When I first came here," Veyra said quietly, "I thought I just needed a place to recover. Somewhere to plan my next move. Four walls and a roof, nothing more."

"And now?"

"Now I look at this place and see..." She gestured toward the activity below. "Finn's been here since before I arrived, but he's started asking Vera about animal handling, wants to learn to be more than just a stable boy. Mistress Elba complains about our growing numbers, but she bought extra blankets last week without being asked, made sure everyone has what they need for winter—even though she has nowhere to store them. Grimjaw's teaching the younger soldiers techniques they'd never learn in the Watch. We're not just sharing space anymore. We're sharing knowledge, skills, lives."

Thorne followed her gaze, seeing the connections she'd noticed. The way Halden had started learning herb lore from Aldwin. How Fayne was teaching Vera to read architectural drawings. The careful dance of people who'd learned to live in each other's pockets, to work around each other's needs.

"It's not just a company anymore."

"No. It's a community. A home." Veyra's scarred hands gripped the stone parapet. "But look at it, Thorne. Really look. Aldwin can barely fit his herbs in that window box, and half of them are dying. Halden's working in a corner behind a curtain, treating battle wounds in a space meant for storing mops. Grimjaw's forge is adequate for basic repairs, but he can't do the precision work we'll need—there's no room for a proper quenching trough, no space for specialized tools. And Mistress Elba's right—we're eating into our food stores faster than we can replenish them because there's nowhere to preserve supplies properly."

She turned to face him fully, and in the dying light he could see the determination that had carried her through the darkest moments of the past months. "We've built something precious here, but we're strangling it. Every day we stay, we risk losing someone because we couldn't treat them properly, or missing a threat because our scouts are exhausted from sleeping in shifts, or failing a mission because our equipment failed from poor maintenance."

"The Westwall Watchpost was never meant to house this many people permanently."

"It was never meant to house the Last Light Company." The name carried weight when she said it, promise and purpose combined. "We need more than just space, Thorne. We need a workshop where Grimjaw can craft the tools that will save lives. An infirmary where Aldwin and Halden can practice their arts properly. A library where we can study maps and gather intelligence. Training grounds where we can hone skills without worrying about cracking our skulls on low beams."

Thorne was quiet for a long moment, watching the last light fade from the western sky. The first stars were beginning to appear, and somewhere in the darkness, an owl called. When he spoke, his voice carried the weight of command decisions and the warmth of personal investment.

"We've built something here, Veyra. Something worth protecting, worth expanding. These people—they're not just following orders anymore. They're following a vision. Your vision."

"Our vision." She touched his arm lightly, a rare gesture of connection. "I couldn't have done any of this without you. Without all of you."

He looked down at the courtyard where their people continued their evening routines, unaware of the conversation taking place above them. Vera was on the stable roof—the only place she could find solitude—speaking quietly with Echo. Grimjaw was showing Venn how to maintain a blade properly, though they had to stand in the doorway of the forge because there wasn't room inside for two people and the weapons.

"The question is," Thorne said carefully, "where do we go from here? The city won't give us another watchtower, not with Grimsby already complaining about our unofficial status. And we don't have the resources to buy property in Waterdeep—the prices there would bankrupt a small kingdom."

Veyra was quiet for a moment, her mind already working through possibilities like she was planning a campaign. "There are other options. Abandoned keeps in the countryside that noble families have left to rot. Old mansions that have been empty for years, too expensive to maintain but too proud to sell cheaply. Places where we could build something proper—workshops for Grimjaw with room for a proper forge and all the tools he needs. A real infirmary for Aldwin and Halden with separate rooms for different types of care. Storage that doesn't require Mistress Elba to perform miracles daily."

"And a proper kitchen for Mistress Elba to rule with an iron fist and adequate pantry space."

A rare smile crossed Veyra's features, visible even in the growing darkness. "That too. And training grounds where our people can actually train without memorizing which cobblestone will trip them. Quarters where people can sleep without hearing every nightmare, every private moment."

They stood in comfortable silence as the stars began to appear overhead, each lost in their own thoughts about the future. Below them, the Westwall Watchpost settled into the rhythm of night—guards changing shifts with barely room to pass each other on the narrow stairs, the last embers of the forge dying as Grimjaw finally found space to properly bank them, Aldwin's window glowing softly as he worked late into the night, trying to save his dying herbs.

It had been a good beginning, this borrowed home. They'd made it work through determination and adaptability, through the bonds they'd forged in close quarters. But beginnings, by their very nature, were meant to lead somewhere else. A seed needed room to grow, or it would wither. And the Last Light Company was ready to grow.

"We'll start looking," Veyra said finally, her voice carrying the same determination that had pulled her through the fire and brought them all together. "Quietly, carefully. We'll need to scout locations, assess what would need repair, calculate costs. It can't be too far from the city—we need to be able to respond quickly to emergencies. But it needs to be far enough that we have room to truly build something."

"When we find the right place—"

"When we find the right place," Thorne agreed, understanding the weight of the commitment they were making, "we'll build the Last Light Company a proper home. A place where every member can practice their craft without compromise. Where we can train the next generation of specialists. Where people can heal in peace and dignity."

The commitment hung in the cold air between them, a promise made on a winter evening that would shape everything that came after. They weren't just planning a move—they were planning a future. A place where their vision could fully manifest, where "no one left behind" would have the space and resources to mean something real.

In the distance, a lone wolf howled—not a sound of threat, but of territory being claimed, of a pack declaring its place in the world. The sound seemed to echo their own intention, their own need to claim space in a world that didn't always make room for those who chose to stand in the breach.

Below, someone laughed—probably Grimjaw finishing one of his stories. The sound drifted up through the cold air, warm and alive despite the constraints of their situation. They had built something precious here, something worth protecting and expanding. They had found each other in this cramped, imperfect space. Now it was time to find a place worthy of what they were becoming.

"Tomorrow," Veyra said, "we start planning in earnest. Fayne's good with maps and calculations—he can help us understand what we need. Grimjaw knows construction. Aldwin understands what a proper healing space requires. We'll pool our knowledge, make a real plan."

"And tonight?"

"Tonight, we appreciate what we have. Tomorrow, we work toward what we need."

They descended the narrow stairs together, carefully navigating the worn stones and the failing rope rail. Behind them, the stars continued to emerge, bright and cold and infinite. The Westwall Watchpost might be cramped, might be failing them in a dozen ways, but it had given them this—a foundation, a beginning, a proof that what they were building could work.

The Last Light Company had found its purpose. Now it needed to find its place.

And they would. Whatever it took, however long the search, they would find a home that matched their vision. A place where hearth and hone could exist in harmony, where the warmth of community had room to grow alongside the sharp edge of expertise.

The wolf howled again, and this time, it sounded like a promise.
