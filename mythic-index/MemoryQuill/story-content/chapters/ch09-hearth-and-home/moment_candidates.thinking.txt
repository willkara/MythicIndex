Let me analyze this chapter for visual storytelling potential. Chapter 9 "Hearth and Home" is about the Last Light Company outgrowing their current space at the Westwall Watchpost. It's a quieter, domestic chapter focused on daily routines, space constraints, and the growing realization they need a proper home.

Let me go through each scene and identify potential visual moments:

**Scene 1: The Pre-Dawn Quiet (scn-09-01)**
- Veyra alone with maps in the cold mess hall, embers dying
- Thorne entering silently with tea
- Mistress Elba struggling with overflowing supplies
- Finn and the onion incident (comedic)

Potential moments:
1. Veyra at the map table, frost on windows, embers casting long shadows - HERO potential (establishes chapter tone)
2. Elba overwhelmed by supplies, struggling to organize chaos - character moment showing strain

**Scene 2: The Company Wakes (scn-09-02)**
- Grimjaw's hammer strikes as dawn signal
- Aldwin meditating with struggling herbs
- Vera checking horses in overcrowded stable
- Crowded barracks with Darric/Venn/Fayne
- Overcrowded breakfast scene

Potential moments:
1. Grimjaw's hammer striking at dawn - symbolic, establishes rhythm
2. Vera in the stable with overcrowded horses - shows strain
3. The crowded mess hall breakfast - shows community but also cramped conditions
4. Veyra watching from head of table, cataloguing problems - character revelation

**Scene 3: The Healer's Ledger (scn-09-03)**
- Cramped infirmary behind curtain
- Halden's improvised workspace
- Aldwin grinding herbs
- Their conversation about holistic healing vs field medicine

Potential moments:
1. The cramped infirmary corner - the curtain, improvised table, poor light


2. Aldwin and Halden working in close quarters, having to coordinate movement
3. Close-up on Halden's instruments on uneven door-table

I see tight spatial dynamics revealing the company's challenges. The healers' workspace illustrates their resourcefulness, with Aldwin and Halden navigating a constrained environment. Their careful movements and improvised tools showcase adaptability under limited conditions. The uneven door-table and cramped infirmary become metaphors for the group's current state - making do, but clearly needing more space.

**Scene 4: Lessons in the Yard (scn-09-04)**
- Grimjaw sparring with Darric and Venn in confined space
- Vera teaching tracking to Fayne
- Skill-sharing and growth moments

Potential moments:
1. Grimjaw demonstrating combat in confined space - PIVOT potential (shows adaptation)
2. Vera and Fayne studying tracks in the small patch of earth
3. The moment Grimjaw outmaneuvers both

The yard becomes a crucible of learning. Grimjaw's combat training in tight quarters reveals survival strategies, while Vera's tracking lesson transforms a small earth patch into a classroom of wilderness skills. Each interaction represents growth through constraint, with experienced members passing knowledge to younger soldiers.

The forge's rhythmic hammer strikes and morning light create a backdrop of disciplined transformation. Tactical instruction emerges not just through words, but through demonstration and shared experience. These moments build more than skills - they construct a cohesive unit bound by mutual understanding and survival instincts.

The breakfast scene captures collective adaptation, revealing complex group dynamics through visual chaos. Mismatched bowls and steaming plates symbolize both scarcity and connection, with each character's positioning telling a nuanced story of survival and interdependence.

The cramped infirmary exposes profound character depths, particularly through Aldwin and Halden's constrained workspace. Their philosophical approaches emerge through improvised healing methods, demonstrating dignity despite limited resources.

Grimjaw's combat demonstration brilliantly transforms physical constraints into a powerful teaching moment. An elderly dwarf's masterful movement in a confined space becomes a metaphor for wisdom triumphing over youthful impetuousness, showcasing how experience can transcend physical limitations.

The parapet scene suggests an emerging emotional connection, with sunset light potentially illuminating unspoken tensions or shared hopes between Veyra and Thorne.

Their partnership crystallizes during this pivotal moment, symbolized by their elevated perspective overlooking potential new territories. The golden light and silhouetted figures represent transition - an ending and beginning simultaneously, with their shared vision becoming a narrative turning point.

The wolf's howl serves as a primal declaration of commitment, its nighttime setting adding atmospheric weight to the group's determination to claim and define their future space.

Veyra's strategic assessment continues, methodically mapping potential paths forward. She's evaluating multiple narrative moments - from solitary map study to community interactions - each scene potentially revealing critical character dynamics and group challenges.

Key selections emerge with precise scoring: Veyra's pre-dawn map contemplation, Grimjaw's rhythmic hammer strikes, the crowded breakfast scene, and the cramped infirmary moment. Each scene carries a distinct narrative weight, scoring between 16-17, suggesting rich potential for character and thematic development.

The selection process involves balancing intimate character moments with broader community perspectives, seeking scenes that illuminate both individual struggles and collective adaptation.

Grimjaw's combat lesson anchors the narrative progression, scoring a robust 18, while Veyra and Thorne's sunset parapet interaction represents a pivotal decision point with the highest score of 23. These moments strategically span different locations and emotional landscapes, creating a nuanced narrative tapestry.

The chosen scenes demonstrate intentional variety: quiet reflection, physical training, interpersonal dynamics, and critical decision-making. They traverse temporal and spatial dimensions, from pre-dawn forge to sunset parapet, tracking the story's emotional and strategic evolution.

The scene distribution looks balanced, with each segment contributing a distinct moment that advances character development and plot complexity.
