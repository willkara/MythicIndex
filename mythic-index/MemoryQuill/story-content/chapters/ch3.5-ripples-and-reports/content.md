**ALCHEMICAL ACCIDENT SPARKS DOCK WARD INFERNO**
*Watch Praised for Swift Containment, Heroic Rescues*

**WATERDEEP** – A catastrophic fire erupted in a Dock Ward tenement last night, believed to have been caused by an unlicensed alchemical workshop in the building's basement. The blaze, which witnesses described as "unnatural and terrifyingly fast," consumed the three-story structure and threatened to spread to the adjacent warehouses before a swift response from the City Watch contained the disaster.

Led by Captains Thorne Brightward and Grimsby of the Westwall Watchpost, the Watch established a secure perimeter, managing the panicked crowd and preventing further loss of life through their adherence to established protocols. "Our primary objective in these situations is containment," Captain Grimsby stated, his uniform still bearing traces of soot. "The Watch performed admirably, maintaining order and ensuring the safety of the surrounding district through strict adherence to procedure."

Several rescues were performed by Captain Brightward's patrol, who evacuated five individuals from the upper floors of the burning structure. "It was a textbook operation," Grimsby asserted, though he declined to elaborate on specific tactics employed.

Eyewitness accounts, however, paint a more complex picture of the night's events. Many in the crowd spoke of a scarred woman with a lantern whose warnings prevented what could have been a catastrophic response to the chemical fire.

"She appeared like a specter from the smoke," said Merta, a fishmonger whose stall was nearly consumed. "She called out that water would make it worse—and gods' truth, a moment later someone threw water on it and the whole thing exploded like dragon's breath. That woman, the one they call Ash-Marked... she saved us all."

When asked about this mysterious figure, identified by multiple sources as Veyra Thornwake, the survivor of the recent Undershade Canyon tragedy, Captain Grimsby's response was carefully measured. "Civilian involvement in emergency situations presents unique challenges. The City Watch maintains strict protocols for good reason. We cannot endorse unauthorized participation in dangerous rescue operations."

The Chronicle did manage to obtain a brief statement from Commander Thornwake herself. When asked about her role in the rescue, she responded with characteristic brevity: "Fire doesn't care about protocol. Neither do I."

When pressed about her remarkable survival and growing reputation, her answer was even shorter: "I'm not a symbol. I'm a solution."

Despite the official narrative emphasizing standard Watch procedure, the whispers in the Dock Ward this morning tell a different story—of a woman who walked into fire when others held the line, who saw danger where trained eyes saw safety, who brought expertise born from tragedy rather than training.

The death toll stands at three, all trapped in the basement workshop when the structure collapsed. Some witnesses claim more could have been saved with different tactics, though Watch officials maintain that all standard procedures were properly followed.

As this paper goes to print, questions remain about the increasing frequency of alchemical accidents in the Ward and whether current Watch protocols are sufficient for these new threats. One thing is certain: the people of the Dock Ward sleep a little easier knowing that someone who understands fire's true nature stands ready to face it again.

**MEMORANDUM FOR THE WATCH COMMANDER'S OFFICE**

**FROM:** Captain Grimsby, Westwall Watchpost  
**DATE:** 15th of Ches, 1372 DR  
**SUBJECT:** Incident Report Addendum: Dock Ward Tenement Fire, File #77B-4

This addendum serves to formally document several procedural irregularities observed during the containment and rescue operations at the Dock Ward tenement fire of the 14th.

While the operation resulted in successful containment of the blaze, Captain Thorne Brightward enacted a series of decisions that deviated significantly from established Watch protocol. These deviations warrant official review and potential disciplinary action.

**Specific violations observed:**

1. **Abandonment of Assigned Post:** Captain Brightward unilaterally abandoned perimeter control duties to engage in direct rescue attempts, compromising the integrity of the containment line and setting dangerous precedent for future operations.

2. **Introduction of Unauthorized Personnel:** Captain Brightward permitted an injured civilian, one Veyra Thornwake, to access the active emergency zone. Ms. Thornwake, while possessing anecdotal experience with fire, is not a registered consultant with the Watch and represented significant liability. Her presence encouraged other civilians to approach the danger zone.

3. **Deviation from Established Procedure:** Tactical decisions were made based on this civilian's recommendations rather than the established protocols detailed in Manual Section 7, Subsection 3: Chemical Fire Response. While the outcome was fortunate, the precedent is extremely dangerous.

4. **Breakdown of Command Structure:** By deferring to civilian expertise, Captain Brightward undermined the authority of the Watch and created confusion in the chain of command. Several junior officers were observed taking orders directly from Ms. Thornwake.

It is my professional assessment that Captain Brightward, while demonstrating personal bravery, exhibited a troubling disregard for the protocols that ensure consistent, safe, and legally defensible emergency response. His apparent personal relationship with Ms. Thornwake appears to have compromised his professional judgment.

**Recommendation:** Formal reprimand with notation in permanent record. Mandatory refresher training on emergency protocols. Consideration for temporary suspension pending review.

The integrity of the Watch depends upon adherence to established procedures. We cannot allow individual officers to freelance during emergencies, regardless of outcome.

*Respectfully submitted,*  
*Captain H. Grimsby*  
*Westwall Watchpost*

**(Later, in private)**

Thorne set the copy of Grimsby's report on Veyra's table. She was working on new arrow shafts, her movements precise despite the lingering stiffness in her scarred hand.

"Grimsby filed his complaint," Thorne said, his voice carefully neutral.

Veyra didn't look up from her fletching. "Good for him. How many counts of insubordination?"

"Four. He's thorough."

"Only four?" She tested the arrow's balance. "You're slipping, Captain."

"This could end my career, Veyra."

Now she did look up, meeting his eyes directly. "Your career, or your ability to save lives?"

"In the Watch, they're supposed to be the same thing."

"But they're not." She set down the arrow. "You made a choice. You chose lives over protocol. If that ends your Watch career, maybe it's time for a different career."

"The Last Light Company."

"The Last Light Company," she agreed. "Where the only protocol is bringing everyone home."

Thorne picked up one of her finished arrows, admiring the craftsmanship. "You know this will make us enemies. Grimsby, the bureaucrats, maybe even some of the Lords."

"Good," Veyra said flatly. "Enemies clarify things. You know where you stand with enemies."

"And where do we stand?"

She gestured to the lantern burning steadily on the table. "In the light. Always in the light. Let them have their shadows and their papers. We'll have the people we save."

Dokra Ironvein's arrival was announced by the heavy thud of her medical bag hitting the floor. She stood in the doorway of the barracks, arms crossed, fixing Veyra with a glare that could melt iron.

"I hear you've been collecting new injuries before I've finished cataloging the old ones," she rumbled, entering without invitation.

Veyra sat on her cot, attempting to rewrap a bandage one-handed. Several new burns decorated her arms—minor compared to the canyon scarring, but fresh enough to be concerning.

"Let me see," Dokra ordered, sweeping over with the inevitability of an avalanche.

She took Veyra's arm with surprising gentleness, examining the new burns with professional efficiency. "Second-degree on the forearm, first-degree on the back of the hand. You're lucky—another few seconds and you'd have matching scars on both arms."

"Symmetry has its appeal," Veyra said dryly.

"Your body isn't a canvas for disaster art," Dokra snapped, pulling out a jar of cooling salve. "It's the only one you get. Treat it with some respect."

"I treat it as a tool. Tools get worn with use."

"Tools also break when pushed too hard." Dokra began applying the salve with practiced motions. "Your bones are still knitting from the canyon. Your lungs are scarred. Your skin is held together by will and my stitching. You keep this up, and there won't be enough of you left to save anyone."

"There are people who need—"

"There are people who need you alive," Dokra interrupted. "That patrol out there? They look at you like you're made of miracles and moonlight. You die trying to save strangers, and you'll break them worse than any fire could."

Veyra was quiet for a moment. "They shouldn't look at me like that."

"Too late. You became their compass when you walked out of that canyon. Now you have a responsibility to stay alive long enough to point them in the right direction."

"I didn't ask for that responsibility."

"No one asks for the important ones." Dokra finished wrapping the burns with clean linen. "They just land on you like rain, and you either drown or learn to swim."

She pulled out a small bottle of tonic, pressing it into Veyra's hand. "For the pain. And before you say you don't need it—pain is not courage. Pain is just pain. Take the damn medicine."

Veyra accepted the bottle. "You're a terrible healer. You're supposed to be gentle and nurturing."

"I am being gentle. You should see me when I'm actually angry." Dokra gathered her supplies. "No more fires for at least a week. Doctor's orders."

"And if there's an emergency?"

"Then you direct from a safe distance like a proper commander instead of charging in like a suicidal scout."

After Dokra left, Veyra sat alone, looking at the fresh bandages. She could feel the weight of what the dwarf had said—the responsibility not just to save others, but to stay alive for those who needed her to lead.

It was a different kind of burden than survivor's guilt. Heavier in some ways. But maybe, just maybe, it was one worth carrying.

The knock was tentative, barely audible over the evening sounds of the barracks. Thorne opened the door to find a small family—a woman with soot still in her hair, holding the hands of two young children.

"Beggin' your pardon, Captain," the woman said, her voice nervous. "We wanted... we needed to say thank you."

Thorne recognized them—the family Venn had guided across the rooftop. "Please, come in. No need to stand in the cold."

They entered hesitantly, the children peeking out from behind their mother's skirts. The woman held out a simple loaf of bread, still warm, wrapped in a clean but patched cloth.

"We don't have much," she stammered, tears starting to form in her eyes. "Lost most everything in the fire. But my husband, he said we had to come. Had to say thank you proper-like."

Thorne accepted the loaf with the gravity it deserved. In his hands, he held hours of work, precious ingredients, and profound gratitude—worth more than gold to those who had given it.

"This is more than enough," he said gently. "You're safe. That's what matters."

The youngest child, a girl no older than six, stepped forward shyly. She held out a folded piece of parchment to Veyra, who had been watching from her corner.

"What's your name?" Veyra asked, her voice softer than any of the patrol had heard it.

"Sara," the girl whispered. "Like the princess in the stories Mama tells."

"Well, Princess Sara," Veyra said, accepting the parchment with careful hands, "this is a royal gift indeed."

She unfolded it. The drawing was simple—stick figures rendered in charcoal and what looked like berry juice for color. There was a row of smiling people (the family), a dark scribble (the fire), and standing between them, a figure holding a bright yellow circle that took up a quarter of the page (the lantern).

"Mama says you keep the light on," Sara said, gaining courage. "So people can find their way home even when it's scary and dark."

For a long moment, Veyra couldn't speak. She stared at the child's drawing, at the oversized lantern that dominated the image, at the simple truth rendered in a child's understanding.

"Sometimes, yes," she finally managed, her voice thick. "Thank you for reminding me why."

The mother stepped forward. "That light... when we were on the roof, everything burning below, your man Venn pointing the way... we saw it. That lantern, burning steady through all that smoke. It was like... like a promise. That there was something beyond the fire."

"There's always something beyond the fire," Veyra said, carefully folding the drawing. "You just have to be stubborn enough to reach it."

After the family left, the patrol gathered around the table where the bread sat like a small monument. Veyra had placed Sara's drawing next to it, the bright yellow lantern seeming to glow in the lamplight.

"That bread's worth more than my month's pay," Venn said quietly.

"Worth more than all our pays combined," Kelen corrected.

They divided it carefully, reverently, each taking a small piece. It was simple bread—a bit dense, slightly burnt on the bottom—but it tasted like purpose.

"This is why," Veyra said, looking at each of them. "Not for the Lords. Not for the Watch. Not for glory or gold. For this. For Sara and her family. For the next fire and the one after that."

"For everyone who needs a light in the dark," Thorne added.

They ate in silence, but it was a comfortable quiet—the kind shared by people who understand their purpose.

Later that night, after the bread was gone and Sara's drawing was carefully pinned to the wall, the patrol gathered for what would later be remembered as the first official meeting of the Last Light Company.

Veyra had spread a map of Waterdeep on the table, marking recent fire sites with red ink. The pattern was disturbing—too many, too frequent, too similar.

"The phosphorus blend from tonight," she began, all business now. "It's not amateur work. Someone knows what they're doing."

"The cult?" Thorne asked.

"Or someone inspired by them. Fire as a weapon, not just destruction." She tapped the map. "We need to be ready for more. And that means we need the right people."

"We need healers," Halden said immediately. "Real healers, not just field medics like me. Someone who understands trauma, who can do more than bandage and pray."

"Brother Aldwin Gentleheart," Thorne said, the name surprising everyone. "He's... different. Unconventional. But I've seen him bring people back from the edge when everyone else had given up."

"Gentleheart?" Venn laughed. "The death priest? The one who talks to corpses?"

"He doesn't talk to corpses," Thorne corrected. "He talks to the dying. Helps them find peace. And sometimes, that peace gives them strength to fight."

"We need builders," Kelen added. "Or at least someone who understands how buildings fail. Tonight, if we'd known which beam was load-bearing..."

"And trackers," Darric said. "That child who ran—we lost them in seconds. City's a maze if you don't know how to read it."

Veyra nodded, making notes. "We also need a charter. Legal standing. The authority to act without Grimsby's permission."

"Leave that to me," Thorne said. "I know people. Clerk Dena for one. She's already delayed Grimsby's complaint. She believes in what we're doing."

"What about funding?" Fayne asked, ever practical. "Good intentions don't buy equipment or pay wages."

"We start small," Veyra said. "Prove ourselves. The city funds what it needs, and after tonight, they need us whether they admit it or not."

She stood, moving to the lantern. Its light cast long shadows on the wall, making the room seem larger than it was.

"The Last Light Company isn't just about rescue," she said. "It's about being the light that refuses to go out. No matter how dark it gets. No matter how hopeless it seems. We keep burning."

"When do we start?" Venn asked.

Veyra smiled—a real smile, perhaps the first since the canyon. "We already have. Tonight, with that bread, with Sara's drawing, with Grimsby's complaint—we've already begun. The question is: how far are we willing to go?"

"All the way," Thorne said without hesitation.

"To the last light," Kelen added.

"To the last breath," Halden said.

"To the last hope," Fayne murmured.

"To bringing them all home," Venn finished.

They stood together in the lantern light, not as Watch officers bound by protocol, but as something new. Something necessary. Something forged in fire and tempered by compassion.

Outside, the city slept, unaware that its newest guardians had just sworn an oath not to any lord or law, but to the simple promise of a child's drawing: that there would always be a light, no matter how dark the night became.

And in that light, the Last Light Company was truly born.
