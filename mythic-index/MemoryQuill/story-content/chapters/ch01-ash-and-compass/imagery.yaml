locations:
  - ref: "undershade-canyon"
    zones:
      - id: "rim-overlook"
        chapter_context: |
          Canyon rim at golden twilight. Sun-warm shale underfoot, molten brass light pooling along the lip. Below, the canyon coils in ochre bands—a vast throat exhaling heat that doesn't belong to early autumn. The air tastes of sage and distant brimstone. Single-file descent visible on glazed switchbacks below—old fire scars, ritual burn-signs.

      - id: "temple-nave"
        chapter_context: |
          Vine-strangled pillars at ancient threshold, dragon carvings sleeping beneath moss. Inside: vaulted nave with thick stale heat, feathers charred to ash-gray littering flagstones. Brass braziers in rows, now igniting with green-white flame. A scorched circle on the floor, fresh. At the far end: basalt plinth bearing ember-amber orb with living cinders.

      - id: "antechamber"
        chapter_context: |
          Death trap. Where the team is sealed by cooling glass walls after the dragon-fire explosion. No other exit. Smoke seeping through cracks. Ceiling buckling from heat above. This is where Borin strikes the glass, where Elara dies, where Ignis vanishes in copper-red light.

      - id: "glass-barrier"
        chapter_context: |
          Wall of fused glass—molten stone cooled to translucent rippled barrier. Distorted but clear enough to see through. The gap Borin broke with his hammer—narrow, barely wide enough for an arm. His blood on the glass edges. Through the barrier: bodies visible, rubble, the aftermath of sealed doom.

      - id: "cairn-site"
        chapter_context: |
          Memorial site where Veyra builds cairns. Stone carried by shield, names carved in blood. Cairn for Lysander over collapsed arch. Empty/waiting cairn for Ignis—question mark. Blood-carved names on stone wall: LYSANDER. IGNIS. ELARA. BORIN. The obsidian shard still lies nearby.

      - id: "transept"
        chapter_context: |
          Where Veyra arranges the recovered bodies for ceremony, and where the Watch patrol finds her. Glass-slick walls catching torchlight. Two shrouded forms laid on battered shield like an altar. Relics placed at lantern's base like a shrine. The space where six fists strike chestplates and the Company is born.

      Veyra kneels at the lip of Undershade Canyon, one boot braced against sun-warm shale, her battered lantern held aloft. The day's last gleam pools like molten brass along the canyon rim. Behind her, four silhouettes gather: Lysander with his easy confidence, Ignis trailing faint sparks, Elara half in shadow, Borin solid as stone. Below, the canyon coils in ochre bands, exhaling heat that warps the air.

      Wide establishing shot. Low angle from canyon depth looking up at silhouetted figures on rim. Veyra dominant left with lantern creating golden halo. Canyon bands fill lower two-thirds. Team silhouettes against molten brass sky.

      Lysander holds the narrowing gap between molten stone walls, his body a living wedge. His shield glows cherry-red against his arm, metal buckling inward.

His mouth forms his final word: LIVE.
