      Wide shot of the Temple Nave. A massive, serpentine entity made of green-white fire coils through the air, dominating the upper frame. Below, the Gilded Compass party is scattered but fighting. Borin slams his hammer down, creating a dome of silver light that buckles under the fire's heat. Ignis stands with hands raised, wreathed in chaotic orange fire, trying to counter the green flames. Veyra is on a high ledge in the foreground, firing an arrow.
    composition_notes: |
      Dynamic, chaotic composition. The fire serpent forms an 'S' curve through the frame. The party is small compared to the threat. High contrast between the green-white dragon fire and the warm orange of Ignis's magic.

      Close medium shot of Lysander Valerius framed by a narrowing gap of rough stone. He is bracing his shield against the crushing walls with his shoulder. The shield is glowing cherry-red from heat, the metal buckling. His leather armor is smoking and bubbling. His face is illuminated from below by the molten rock floor—he is sweating, gritting teeth with effort, but his eyes are calm and locked on the viewer (Veyra). Behind him is a wall of solid fire.

    visual_description: |
      Full shot of Veyra standing in the transept ruins. She looks like a revenant—half her face burned, clothes shredded, covered in gray ash. She stands over two shroud-wrapped bodies laid on a large shield. In one hand she holds a naked sword (point down), in the other her lantern, which burns surprisingly bright. She is snarling at the viewer (the patrol), defensive and wild. The background is smoke and dark stone columns.
    composition_notes: |
      Pyramidal composition: The shield/bodies form the base, Veyra is the apex. She blocks the path to the dead.

      Wide shot of the Watch patrol standing in a circle in the ruins. Thorne is in the center, supporting a collapsing Veyra. Surrounding them are the five other guards (Kelen, Darric, Venn, Halden, Fayne). They are all striking their chestplates with their fists in unison—a salute. Dust rises from the impact. The lantern sits on the ground in the center of the circle, lighting all their faces from below. The mood is solemn, vowed, and unified.

      Radial composition. The lantern is the hub. The soldiers are the spokes. Thorne and Veyra are the heart.
