The day's last gleam pooled like molten brass along the lip of Undershade Canyon. Veyra Thornwake knelt at the edge, one boot braced against sun-warm shale, her battered lantern held aloft. Its panes, clouded by long miles yet immaculate within, cast a pale gold halo that fluttered against the oncoming dusk.

Below, the canyon coiled in ochre bands, a vast throat exhaling heat that did not belong to early autumn. The air tasted of sage and distant brimstone. Veyra narrowed her good eye; the other, clouded by scar tissue, caught only a ghost of color.

A bright whistle cut the hush. "Scout! Tell me there's a kind road down."

Lysander Valerius strode across the rim, dusk limning the gilt rivets on his jack. He offered that effortless smile he saved for looming hazards—the kind that kept morale high when odds looked grim. "Promise me a drink when we get back," he said with the easy confidence of a leader who never doubted they'd all make it home.

Veyra didn't look up, but a small, almost imperceptible smile touched her lips. "Drink's on you if you keep both hands on the map," she countered, her voice a low murmur. "No kind roads. Only clever ones. South switchbacks are glazed—old fire." She closed her notebook, the leather scarred by many moons. "Might be ritual burn-sign."

"And to maps that catch fire—imagine the stories," Ignis Emberheart mused, stepping from a swirl of conjured embers. With an artful flick of his tail, the flames vanished like blown candles, leaving only the scent of copper and ozone.

Elara Whisperwind chuckled, a sound like stones in a silk purse. "Keep your feet, Lysander, and your tongue intact," she advised, sliding a dagger across her knuckles so the steel caught sunset's last spark.

Behind her, Borin Stonehand heaved his pack down and uncorked a wineskin. "Gold buys wine, not sense," the dwarf rumbled, his voice a gravelly counterpoint to Elara's smooth tones. "Keep the sense." He offered the skin in blessing. "To clever roads, and Berronar's grace upon them."

Lysander cracked Lord Valerius's seal with a flourish. "Five thousand golden moons on safe return of the heirloom—more if we flash a winning smile."

"Gold spends," Borin agreed, "but safety spends longer." His tone was jocular, yet his eyes tracked the deepening haze with a healer's caution.

Veyra's gaze slipped canyon-ward. The lantern light flickered—as if answering a breath far below. "We should reach the floor before full dark," she murmured, her hand instinctively tightening on the lantern's handle. "Something down there is… waking."

"Stones don't wake," Ignis protested with a grin.

"These do," she answered, her voice a low murmur that was lost in the wind.

They descended single-file: Veyra ghosting ahead; Lysander with measured tread; Borin humming a hearth-song to Berronar Truesilver; Elara half-in shadow; Ignis whistling a tune that threw off faint sparks. Halfway down, Veyra's lantern flared unbidden. Heat, sharp as a forge door, brushed her cheek.

She lifted two fingers—a silent halt. Everyone froze. From the abyss rose a thread of chanting, the ancient tongue of dragons biting the cooling air like acid on stone.

Elara's smirk faltered. Borin's hand went to the silver-braided emblem of his goddess. Lysander leaned close enough that Veyra felt the warmth of him through battered leather. "Still with us?"

"Always," she said, though her heart beat hard against the lantern's glow. 

Together, they moved again, a quiet vow etched into every step: we go in together, we come out together.

Far below, runes hid beneath chalky dust, waiting for a single breath of night to kindle them alive.

The narrow gorge funneled them into a shadowed cleft where vine-strangled pillars marked an ancient threshold. Carvings of coiled dragons slept beneath blankets of moss; in the lantern's light their eyes seemed to glint, half-dreaming of fire.

Inside, the temple breathed thick, stale heat. Feathers—charred to ash-gray—littered the flagstones like offerings long forgotten. A vaulted nave opened ahead, its walls lined with brass braziers cold and dark. Veyra's boots found the faint outline of a circle scorched into the floor: fresh, no more than a week old.

"Someone's played with fire recently," she whispered.

Elara slipped forward, tools glinting, to test a needle trap hidden in a cracked arch. With a deft twist she disarmed it; the poisoned spike snapped harmlessly against the stone. "Clean work," she murmured. "They wanted us whole for the burning."

Borin muttered approval while checking vestiges of old ward-sigils—symbols of protection now half-erased. His fingers traced where holy power had once flowed, now just dead stone.

At the far end, upon a basalt plinth, lay the heirloom: a fist-sized orb of ember-amber quartz laced with living cinders. Its core pulsed—slow, steady—like the beat of a dragon's heart.

"This stone hums with something ancient," Ignis said, his eyes shining with awe. "The Weave itself seems to bend around it."

"Feel the patterns, but keep your hands steady until we understand them," Veyra warned, her voice low. She studied the runic grooves encircling the plinth. They were carved not for display but for drainage… as though waiting to drink something hot and bright. "Those channels are meant to channel power. Don't feed them more than necessary."

"We move together," Lysander said, his voice a quiet command. "No heroics before the signal."

Elara's hand rested on the hilt of a dagger. "One flash to rally, two to retreat—remember the signs."

"Trap?" Lysander asked.

"Think so." She traced one channel—ash clung to her fingertip, still warm. "But not ours. This was meant for something else."

Borin stepped beside her, his palm glowing with gentle silver light as divine words spilled from his lips in the tongue of his ancestors. "No active curse," he pronounced, the glow fading. "Only… expectation. Like a held breath."

"Expectation," Ignis echoed, fascination outweighing caution. He cupped the orb. Its inner cinders flared, casting dragon-scale shadows that rippled across the nave.

Nothing else stirred. No darts, no alarms. Just a deepening hush that hummed in Veyra's bones.

Lysander exhaled. "Package secured. Back the way we came—"

A tremor shivered through the flagstones. Dust sifted from the ribs of the vaulted roof. Far outside, a guttural chant rose—louder now, a mass of voices shaping the dragon-tongue into a single rising note that made the air itself vibrate with dread.

The brazier rows ignited as one, tongues of green-white flame leaping upward to form a shimmering lattice across the doorway—not solid flames yet, but heat so fierce it warped the air like ripples in molten glass.

Veyra's lantern guttered, then steadied—its glow defiant against the unnatural blaze. She met Lysander's eyes. "We're the sacrifice," she said, voice low and cold.

He nodded once, grip tightening on shield leather. "Then we pay them in steel and sweat, not blood."

But somewhere behind the heat-veil, the cultists' chant sharpened—and the fire began to crawl inward like a living thing.

Heat hit like the opening of a forge as the cult's lattice of fire thickened across the nave's mouth. The shimmer of superheated air already scorched lungs raw.

"Flank routes—now!" Veyra barked, her voice cracking in the furnace air.

She shouldered past a splintered colonnade, guiding Elara toward a narrow side-passage half-buried in scree. "I'll scout the high ledge," Veyra said. "When I signal, move."

Lysander nodded—steady eyes despite the furnace glow. "One flash to rally, two to retreat."

"Three if the road is death," she answered, her voice carrying no hint of jest. "Don't make me count past two."

With Ignis channeling protective wards around the relic and Borin whispering prayers that made the air shimmer with divine protection, Veyra vaulted a fallen beam and slipped into the fissured gallery that skirted the temple's outer wall. The corridor angled upward, broken roof-stones letting her scramble onto an escarpment overlooking the nave below.

From this perch she saw what the fire had become. The heat-veil convulsed, molding itself into a serpentine silhouette—flames knitting scales of emerald and white. Runes carved in the canyon floor beyond the temple now blazed core-hot, feeding the creature with stolen power. Cultists knelt ring-wide, throats hoarse from the chant that wrenched magic from the very fabric of reality.

Ignis's red-gold aura flared where he stood behind Lysander—desperation stealing grace from his movements. Arcane words tumbled from his lips, his hands weaving complex patterns in the air as he tried to unravel the ritual's weave.

"Wind watch me," Veyra whispered, leveling her longbow. Two swift arrows felled a pair of chanters, breaking a line in the circle. The serpent of fire shuddered—but did not die. Instead the ritual surged, hissing like quenched steel, drawing power from the fallen cultists' own life force.

Below, Lysander flashed the rally-signal—one bright flourish of conjured light. Time to converge.

### Birth of the Breath

Ignis hurled a sigil of tangled fire meant to disrupt the cult's weave; the symbol burst against the ritual circle… and was swallowed whole. A heartbeat later the serpent's maw exploded outward, vomiting a cone of white fire that sheared through the nave's arch and raced up the gallery toward Veyra.

She dove, shoulder crashing stone, felt the burn graze her hair. From the brink she glimpsed the team:

Lysander braced shield-high, leather bubbling and smoking under the heat. "Shield wall! Borin, anchor left!" he shouted over the roar.

Elara sprinted for a fallen pillar, cloak igniting in trailing ribbons. "The air—it's like breathing glass—" she coughed, blood speckling her lips.

Borin planted his war-hammer like a gatepost and roared a hymn that made the stones themselves remember holiness. Silver light blossomed in a protective dome around them—divine grace made manifest—but the barrier flickered and cracked under the dragon-fire's fury.

"I can turn it—give me a heartbeat!" Ignis yelled, his hands already moving in desperate patterns, pulling at threads of magic only he could see.

"Ignis, no! You'll feed it!" Veyra commanded from the ledge, her voice cracking with authority.

But the sorcerer's eyes blazed with determination born of desperation. Power coursed through him, wild and uncontrolled, as he reached for magic beyond his grasp.

A quake tore the floor. Veyra watched the rift split between herself and her friends—narrow but racing wider, swallowing chunks of basalt into darkness. They were on one side; she on the other.

"Take them out! I'll buy you time!" Lysander yelled across the widening gap, his voice strained but clear.

"Not without you!" she screamed back, her voice raw with desperation.

"That's an order, Scout," he replied, and in his calm tone she heard the terrible truth—he had already accepted his death. His eyes met hers across the chasm, and she saw not fear, but trust and unwavering resolve. "Live. Remember. That's your duty now."

### Rally Shattered

The dragon-fire serpent coiled between them and escape, its heat warping the very air. Then Ignis's wild magic snapped its leash—threads of power converging on the ritual's heart. The energies screamed together in terrible harmony before detonating.

Light eclipsed sight. When Veyra's vision cleared, the nave's architecture had transformed—walls of molten stone cooling into rippled glass, the dragon-fire's heat fusing everything it touched into translucent barriers.

The explosion had split them: Veyra thrown back into a side gallery, the others trapped in the main chamber with the fire serpent circling closer. Between them now stood a wall of cooling glass, distorted but clear enough to see through.

"The arch!" Lysander shouted, pointing to where the serpent's pattern left a gap—a narrow passage where the fire had to curve around a load-bearing pillar. "When it moves past—we go!"

The serpent swept by, and for three heartbeats, the gap opened. Lysander didn't hesitate.

"Move! Now!" He drove forward, slamming his shield against the narrowing edges as the molten stone began to close. His body became a living wedge, muscles straining as the gap tried to seal around him. "Through me! GO!"

Heat punched through the gallery—an alchemical flash hotter than any forge. The left half of Veyra's face blistered instantly, skin feeling as if a branding iron kissed bone. Through tears and pain she watched Lysander hold the passage.

Borin grabbed Elara, who was already coughing blood from the superheated air. Ignis pushed them forward, his hands blistering from proximity to the molten edges. They squeezed past Lysander's braced form into the antechamber beyond.

"Captain, you next—" Borin started to turn back.

The stone groaned. The gap was crushing inward, Lysander's shield buckling, its metal beginning to glow cherry-red against his arm. He could pull back now, try to squeeze through—but the opening would seal before he made it.

His eyes found Veyra through the glass wall. Calm. Resolute. Accepting.

"LIVE!" he roared—not to his team, but to her, his final command echoing through the glass.

Then he threw his shoulder upward into the keystone above the gap. The entire archway shuddered. With a sound like thunder, Lysander brought down tons of stone, sealing the fire behind him but also sealing himself beneath the avalanche. His shield spun free from the collapse, clattering across the floor where Veyra could see it through the glass.

### Through the Glass

Veyra pounded against the glass barrier, her fists leaving bloody prints. She could see everything in horrible clarity—her team in the antechamber, temporarily safe but trapped.

Through the distorted glass, she watched Borin immediately begin searching for another exit, his hammer ringing against stone. Elara slumped against a wall, her breathing labored, blood on her lips from the seared air. Ignis stood in the center, hands weaving desperate spell after desperate spell, each one failing to pierce the fused glass prison.

"Can you hear me?" Veyra screamed, but the glass swallowed sound. She could see Borin's mouth moving—prayers to his goddess—but heard nothing.

The horror unfolded in nightmarish silence. The antechamber had no other exit. The air grew thick with smoke as the dragon-fire found cracks, seeping in like poison. She watched Elara try to stand, try to help search, only to collapse. Borin caught her, cradled her as she convulsed.

Minutes stretched like hours. Ignis's spells grew more frantic, more desperate. He hurled fire at the glass—it didn't even crack. Ice—nothing. Pure force—the barrier held.

Borin turned to the glass wall, and for a moment his eyes seemed to find hers through the distortion. He raised his hammer with both hands and struck the barrier with all his divine might. A spider web of cracks appeared—but didn't break through.

He struck again. The cracks widened. Elara was still now, too still. Again. A chunk of glass fell inward. Again. His hands were bleeding. Again. A gap, barely wide enough for an arm—

The ceiling of the antechamber began to buckle from the heat above. Borin shoved Elara's still form toward the gap, trying to push her through to Veyra's side, but she was already gone. He pulled her back, closed her eyes with shaking hands.

Ignis stood apart from them now, his hands weaving patterns Veyra recognized with growing horror—the gestures for something desperate, something that bent reality itself. Teleportation? Planar shift? The magic crackled with unstable energy, copper-red sparks cascading from his fingers.

She watched Borin's final prayer, his hands clasped over his holy symbol. Behind him, Ignis's spell reached its crescendo. The sorcerer's eyes met hers through the glass for just a moment—determination mixed with terror—before he spoke a single word that made the air itself scream.

A flash of copper-red light exploded through the antechamber, so bright it burned afterimages into Veyra's vision. She heard the ceiling collapsing, Borin's final cry—

When her sight returned, Borin lay still beneath fallen stone. But where Ignis had stood, there was only a perfect circle of scorched floor, the stone melted to glass. The barrier itself had a strange ripple in it, as if something impossibly hot had passed through—or tried to. No body. No ash. Just absence and the lingering smell of copper and ozone.

Then the smoke became too thick to see anything more.

She stood at the glass until her legs gave out, her palms pressed against the barrier that had made her a witness to their final moments—death for some, vanishing for another. The screaming had torn her throat raw, but she couldn't remember when she'd stopped.

Veyra's lantern guttered, then steadied—its stubborn flame mirrored in the raw, blistered skin now scoring her face. One scorched hand pressed to the cooling glass wall, as if she could push through by will alone.

"Not left," she breathed, vow forged in fire and grief. "Never left."

She turned into the smoke-choked maze, carrying that vow—and the lantern's defiant glow—down corridors the world had already pronounced a tomb.

For three days, the canyon was a tomb of glass and echoes. Veyra moved through it like a ghost haunting her own grave, her mind fracturing and reforming with each passing hour.

**Day One: Discovery**

Hope was a raw, bleeding thing. Near the collapse, she found Lysander's shield—thrown clear when the arch fell, its metal warped but whole. The shield boss still gleamed beneath the soot and ash, defiant against destruction.

"Your shield," she whispered, lifting it with trembling hands. "Still protecting us."

She searched frantically for survivors, for bodies, for any sign of her team. At the glass barrier where she'd watched them die, she found the gap Borin had broken with his hammer—chunks of glass scattered inward, his blood still on the edges. Through the narrow opening, she could see them: Elara and Borin, partially buried beneath fallen stone and fused glass.

She tried to reach them, stretching her arm through the gap until the glass cut deep into her shoulder. Her fingers barely brushed Elara's cold hand before she had to pull back, blood running down her arm.

"I'll get you out," she promised, her voice cracking. "I swear it. You're not staying in this hell."

She searched for Ignis, finding only that perfect circle of scorched floor, the glass rippled and strange. She pressed her hand against it—still warm, humming with residual magic. But no body. No sign. Had he escaped? Been vaporized? Transported to another plane entirely?

That night, she sat by the gap in the glass, the shield across her lap, planning. Tomorrow she would free them. She had to. The lantern burned steady beside her, and she spoke to it as exhaustion pulled at her consciousness.

"I found them," she whispered. "Tomorrow I bring them home."

**Day Two: The Excavation**

Dawn found her at the gap, shield in hand. She began the work.

Hour by hour, she used Lysander's shield as her only tool. First as a wedge, forcing it into the gap and levering chunks of glass free. The metal screamed against stone, but held. Then as a shovel, scooping away debris handful by handful. As a shield still, when larger pieces of glass broke free and fell toward her.

Blood from her torn hands made the shield slippery. She wrapped strips from her cloak around the grip and continued. The sun climbed overhead, baking the canyon into a furnace, but she worked on. 

"Almost there, Elara," she gasped, finally clearing enough to reach the rogue's body. "Just a bit more."

The lantern's flame seemed to lean leftward, toward a gap she hadn't noticed before—probably just the heat from the sun-baked stone creating air currents, but she followed its suggestion anyway.

Freeing Elara took half the day. The body was wedged beneath a beam of fused stone, and Veyra had to dig around it, under it, using the shield to protect herself as she crawled into the unstable rubble. When she finally pulled Elara free, she laid her gently on the shield.

"One more," she whispered to Borin's still form. "Hold on, old friend."

Borin was harder—his armor had fused to the glass in places. She had to chip away at it piece by piece, the shield ringing with each strike. The ghosts started then—she heard Lysander giving orders, Ignis laughing, but she didn't look up. Couldn't look up. If she stopped now, she'd never start again.

When exhaustion made her hands shake too much to work, she paused, holding the lantern high. Its light seemed to pool more brightly over a section of fused armor, highlighting the best place to strike next. Heat distortion from the cooling glass, nothing more.

As the sun began to set, she finally freed him. Using the shield as a sled, she dragged them both to the transept, their bodies secured with the last strips of her cloak.

That night, exhaustion and delirium blended together. She saw Ignis in the shadows, always just out of reach, that copper-red light flickering at the edges of her vision. Real or hallucination? She no longer knew.

"I got them out," she told the darkness. "Tomorrow, we make it right."

**Day Three: Blood and Memory**

The final day came wrapped in fever dreams and crystalline clarity, alternating like waves.

She arranged the bodies with a ceremony that would have made Borin proud—Elara's daggers crossed on her chest, Borin's holy symbol clasped in his hands. They lay in the transept now, cleaned as best she could manage, wrapped in what remained of their own cloaks.

With the shield, she carried stones to build cairns. One for Lysander, buried beneath tons of rock where he'd made his sacrifice. One for Ignis—but this one felt different. Empty? Waiting? She couldn't shake the feeling that it might not be needed, or might not be enough. Where do you build a monument for someone who simply vanished?

She found a shard of obsidian, its edge sharp enough to cut. First, she carved on the inner surface of the shield itself—four names in her own blood, where they would be protected, carried forever. LYSANDER. IGNIS. ELARA. BORIN. But when she carved Ignis's name, her hand hesitated. Dead? Missing? Escaped? The blood dried in the shape of a question she couldn't answer.

Then she carved them into the stone wall, each letter etched deep, her blood mixing with the ash to make the marks permanent.

"Blood makes it binding," she whispered to the lantern, which had become her only confidant. "My blood, your names. You exist. You were real. I was real because you were real."

She propped the shield between the bodies and the cairns, standing guard as it always had. But she kept looking at that strange ripple in the glass, that perfect circle of scorched stone. Several times she thought she saw copper-red light flickering there, thought she heard his voice echoing from impossible distances.

As the third night deepened, she found herself talking to the lantern and the shield as if they were alive. "They're talking to me," she confided to Elara's shrouded form. "The light says we go together or not at all. The shield says it will carry us all home. But what about the one who vanished? How do we carry someone who might not need carrying?"

When she finally heard real voices—not echoes, not ghosts—she almost didn't believe them. The light of torches hurt her eyes. The shapes of men seemed impossible, too solid, too real.

"I kept the light burning," she whispered to whoever would listen, holding up the lantern with trembling hands. "That's something. That has to be something."

Captain Thorne Brightward and six soot-streaked veterans emerged from the smoke like figures from a half-remembered dream. They moved with practiced caution through the devastation, their torches casting dancing shadows on glass-slick walls.

"Movement! Southwest transept—weapons down, could be survivor!" Sergeant Kelen's voice cracked through the silence.

The patrol stopped short at what they saw. A woman—if she could still be called that—stood guard over two shrouded forms laid upon a battered shield. Half her face was a ruin of blistered flesh and weeping burns. Her clothes hung in tatters, more ash than fabric. But she stood, a naked blade in one hand, a still-burning lantern in the other, the shield at her feet bearing her dead like an altar.

"Gods above—she's standing. She's armed," Archer Venn breathed.

"Look at her face... Captain, that's dragon-burn," Corporal Darric added, his voice hushed with a mixture of horror and awe.

"Three days in this hell..." Medic Halden's medical mind couldn't comprehend it. "She should be dead. The smoke alone..."

Something primal flared in Veyra—a wild animal cornered, protecting its dead. With a raw snarl she forced herself upright, the blade shaking in blistered fingers.

"Back!" Her voice cracked like broken slate. "These ones are mine—you'll not take them." She stepped between the patrol and the shrouded forms, lantern raised like a ward against the world. "I promised! I PROMISED to bring them home!"

"Easy, soldier," Thorne called, removing his helm slowly, showing empty hands. "We're City Watch. You're safe now."

"Safe?" The word triggered something in her, a laugh that was more sob than sound. "There's no safe. The fire took everything. Everything but the light." She gestured wildly with the lantern, its flame casting mad shadows. "The light stayed. I stayed. They..." her voice broke, "they didn't stay."

"Three days in this hell... Captain, she needs water. Now," Halden urged, already moving forward with his medical kit.

"Halden, water. Venn, blanket. Fayne, start cataloguing. Move slow—she's on the edge," Thorne commanded, his voice low and steady, the tone one might use with a spooked horse.

When Halden offered the flask, Veyra stared at it with incomprehension. "Water? Real water? Not... not glass-air?" She took a tentative sip, and the simple act of swallowing seemed to break something within her. "It tastes like... like before. There was a before."

Her legs gave out. Thorne caught her before she hit the ground, his arms steady and sure. Against his breastplate, the dam finally broke.

"I couldn't save them," she sobbed, her fingers clutching at his armor. "Couldn't reach—the fire—Lysander said—he said live. How do I live? How do I live when they don't?"

As she wept, the patrol took in the scene with professional eyes that couldn't hide their human hearts.

"Captain... she laid them out proper," Darric noted, his voice thick. "In this inferno, she gave them dignity."

"She carved their names," Venn said, finding the bloody letters on the stone. "And look—on the inside of the shield too. In her own blood."

"With everything she had left," Kelen answered quietly, noting how the shield had been used—as stretcher, as shovel, as memorial.

Veyra, lost in her grief, spoke to the lantern. "It stayed lit. Three days, three nights. It promised to stay lit."

"The lantern kept its promise," Thorne said, his voice gentle but firm. "And so did you."

Her wild eyes finally focused on him. "You're real? Not shadow? Not echo?"

"Real as stone," he assured her. "We're taking you home."

"Them too," she insisted, a desperate fire returning to her gaze. "We go together. All of us or none—"

"We'll need stretchers for the bodies," Kelen murmured to Thorne. "She won't leave without them."

"I'll rig something," Darric said, already moving. "She kept faith with them; we keep faith with her."

While Thorne held Veyra's trembling form, his patrol worked with quiet efficiency. They fashioned stretchers from cloaks and salvaged timber. They collected scattered relics—Lysander's half-melted shield boss, Borin's cracked holy symbol—and placed them at the lantern's base as if building a shrine to memory.

"Captain, these burns... by any natural law, she should be dead," Halden murmured, his medical training failing him. "The human body has limits."

"Sometimes the impossible just needs a witness," Venn said softly, draping his own cloak over Veyra's shoulders.

The youngest guard, barely out of training, stared at the blood-carved names. "She wrote their names in her own blood?"

"So they couldn't be forgotten," Thorne said, still supporting Veyra's weight. "So someone would know they existed."

Kelen organized the retrieval with military precision, but his voice carried unusual gentleness. "Treat them with honor. They were heroes, same as her."

As they prepared to leave, Thorne lifted the lantern. Its flame brightened, painting amber halos on helms and ash alike. "You brought them home," he said to Veyra. "That's what matters. You brought them home."

"No soul should burn alone," he said again, louder this time, addressing his patrol. "Not on our watch."

Every guard answered by slamming a fist to chestplate. The sound—six resonant thuds—echoed through the ruin like a heartbeat.

Veyra's swollen eye met Thorne's. In that ember-lit moment, something passed between them—an understanding that transcended words. Her vow had found an echo, and in that echo, the first rough shape of something new began to form.

"The light," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "Don't let it go out."

"Never on our watch," Thorne promised.

As they carried her from the canyon, the lantern swinging gently in Thorne's grip, its light pushed back against the dark. Behind them, the carved names remained, blood and ash made permanent on stone, a testament that even in the deepest dark, someone had kept the light burning.

And in that light, the Last Light Company was born.
