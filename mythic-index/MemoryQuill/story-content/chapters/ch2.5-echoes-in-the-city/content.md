The Salamander's Hearth was half-full when the evening bell tolled, oil-lanterns painting the ceiling beams amber like honey on old wood. A trio of moon-elf fiddlers traded soft reels in the corner while sailors, caravan guards, and off-duty watchmen clustered around a scarred round table near the hearth.

"Three days in dragon's breath. Alone." Torrin, a grizzled caravan guard, spoke the words like a prayer, his voice hushed with awe.

"The gods were watching," Sister Melka breathed. She was a lay devotee of Ilmater, her weathered hands wrapped around a pewter mug. "Had to be. No mortal survives that without divine grace."

"Wasn't gods," Ralden countered, his scarred knuckles white around his tankard. The old soldier had seen enough battlefields to know the difference. "Was will. Pure, stubborn, mortal will."

Gillthorn, the tavern's resident skeptic, scoffed from his corner. "Lantern can't burn three days on half a flask of oil. Physics don't work that way."

"Unless it's blessed," Torrin mused, warming to the mystery. "Or cursed. Heard tell some artifacts feed on suffering, burn brighter the worse things get."

"What's the difference anymore?" Melka asked, her gaze growing distant. "Blessing, curse—both leave marks that don't heal."

The tavern door burst open, bringing a gust of rain-scented air. A young courier, still panting from his run, shook water from his cloak. "She's awake," he announced to the room at large. "The Ash-Marked. Saw her myself at Brightstone, sitting up and taking food."

"How'd she look?" Ralden leaned forward, professional interest in his eyes.

The courier considered. "Like she fought death to a standstill and negotiated terms." He accepted a offered mug gratefully. "Half her face is... gods, it's like looking at a map of the Hells. But her eyes—they burn. Not with madness, but with purpose."

Gillthorn snorted. "Death doesn't negotiate. Death wins or waits."

"Maybe this time," Torrin said slowly, a smile spreading across his weathered face, "death blinked first."

A hush settled over the tavern, heavy but not hostile. Even the fiddlers softened their strings, letting the crackle of the hearth fill the space.

Torrin broke the silence first, voice low and thoughtful. "Dragon cult set the trap, so the whispers go. Lured that adventuring party down with promises of treasure, then lit them up like a pyre to their scaled masters." He looked around the table. "If that's true, what's to stop them lighting another canyon? Another crew?"

"That," Ralden said, straightening with military precision, "is why we raise a tankard to Commander Thornwake. Because she's living proof you can walk through their hellfire and drag hope back with you."

Mugs lifted throughout the tavern—not just at their table, but across the room. Melka added quietly, "And a prayer for the souls she carried out. They deserve remembrance too."

They drank in solemn unity, then, as taverns must, the talk rolled forward: arguments over whether the lantern held phoenix down in its wick, wagers on how much of the story was true, theories that she bore secret draconic bloodline that protected her from the flames. 

Yet under every jest and wild theory pulsed a current of genuine gratitude. Gratitude that one woman, half-burned and half-dead, had made it home. Gratitude that the City Watch had been swift enough to find her. Gratitude that in a world of monsters and madness, sometimes the light endured.

Outside, night rain began its soft percussion on cobblestones, while inside, the Salamander's hearthfire crackled on, its glow a small echo of a battered lantern somewhere across the city.

The council chamber smelled of old parchment and political maneuvering. Clerk Dena sat at her desk, quill moving in precise strokes across official vellum. The door opened without a knock—a privilege only certain people claimed.

Lord Aldric Valerius's personal clerk entered, a thin man who moved like oil on water. "My lord requests... discretion in the official report regarding the canyon incident."

Dena didn't look up from her ledger. "The facts are the facts, Master Therin."

"Facts can be... interpreted." Therin placed a small purse on her desk—it made no sound, meaning it held platinum, not gold. "Lord Aldric lost valuable assets in that canyon. His nephew Lysander among them. He would prefer the report emphasize equipment failure rather than cult activity."

"Equipment failure?" Now Dena did look up, her gray eyes sharp. "Five people dead from equipment failure?"

"Misadventure sounds better than dragon cult. Less likely to cause... public concern."

The door opened again. Captain Thorne Brightward entered, still in his patrol gear, soot staining his cloak. He took in the scene—the purse, Therin's oily smile, Dena's rigid posture—and understood immediately.

"Misadventure?" Thorne's voice could have frozen flame. "Tell me, Master Therin, what misadventure creates ritual circles? What accident chants in the dragon tongue?"

"Captain, you weren't there—"

"No, but she was." Thorne stepped closer, using his height advantage. "Veyra Thornwake watched four friends burn. She carved their names in stone with her own blood. You want to call that misadventure?"

"I want to prevent panic—"

"You want to prevent accountability." Thorne's hand moved to his sword hilt—not a threat, just a reminder. "The cult's still out there. Pretending otherwise won't make them disappear."

Therin's composure cracked slightly. "Lord Aldric has significant influence with the Lords' Alliance. It would be... unwise to contradict his preferred narrative."

"And it would be criminal to let more people die because we were too busy managing appearances to manage threats," Dena interjected, her quill still moving. "I'll file both versions—the truth and his lordship's fiction. Let history decide which was right."

Therin's jaw tightened. "You're making powerful enemies."

"Better than making dead innocents," Thorne replied flatly.

After Therin left—taking his purse with him—Thorne showed Dena a different document. "Speaking of reports, Grimsby filed a formal complaint about the dock fire response."

Dena read it quickly, her expression darkening. "He's recommending disciplinary action? Against you? You saved lives!"

"We broke protocol. Used civilian expertise." Thorne's smile was grim. "Apparently, that's worse than letting people burn."

Dena set down her quill, looking at him directly. "What do you need from me?"

"Time. Just delay the filing. I'm working on something—something that might make Grimsby's complaint irrelevant."

"The Last Light Company?" At his surprised look, she smiled slightly. "I have my sources, Captain. And I approve. The city needs people who care more about lives than ledgers."

She took Grimsby's complaint and deliberately placed it at the bottom of a very tall stack. "Oh dear, seems this got misfiled. Might take weeks to surface again."

"Thank you, Dena."

"Don't thank me. Just make it work. Give me something real to file instead of these shadows and lies."

Gray mist clung to the buttresses of Our Lady of Radiant Dawn as pilgrims queued for morning prayers. On the wide marble steps, Preacher Amdir—robes threadbare but voice strong as temple bells—thrust a charred piece of wood skyward.

"The white fire is divine punishment!" he bellowed to the gathering crowd. "The gods themselves reached down to smite the unworthy! The dragon's breath was holy judgment!"

"The white fire was alchemy and madness, nothing more," a calm voice cut through his fervor. 

Mistress Dalra of the Bakers' Guild stood at the foot of the steps, a basket of fresh bread in her arms. Her presence was as solid and warm as the loaves she carried.

"You dare contradict divine revelation?" Amdir's face purpled.

"I dare feed the hungry while you feed their fears," she replied evenly, beginning to distribute bread to the pilgrims. "That woman—Veyra Thornwake—she didn't survive through divine intervention. She survived through human stubbornness and a bit of luck."

"Blasphemy! She was marked by the gods—"

"She was marked by fire," Dalra corrected. "Fire set by cultists, not gods. Unless you're suggesting the gods employ dragon-worshipping madmen these days?"

A young pilgrim, barely sixteen, tugged on a passing paladin's sleeve. "Is she blessed? The survivor? My mother says she must be chosen..."

The paladin—bearing Amaunator's sun symbol—considered carefully. "She's marked," he said finally. "Whether by blessing or burden, only time will tell. But I'll say this—surviving three days in that inferno, keeping a light burning, bringing out her dead... that takes a strength most of us don't have."

Dalra offered the pilgrim a warm roll. "She's alive. Sometimes that's blessing enough."

Up the steps, a snow-haired priestess had been sketching on a blank pillar with chalk. The image was rough but clear: a lantern surrounded by four stars, with the words beneath: *Hope endures the flame*.

"What's that mean?" someone asked.

The priestess smiled. "It means light doesn't always come from heaven. Sometimes it comes from someone too stubborn to let it die."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd:

"Did you hear the lantern burned green the first night?"

"My cousin in the Watch says it pointed the way out, like it was alive..."

"If she lived through that, maybe those cult bastards aren't invincible after all."

"Maybe we don't need divine intervention. Maybe we just need people who won't give up."

Faith pressed shoulders with fear on those steps, and somewhere between them, hope took root—not in divine providence, but in mortal perseverance.

The mess hall smelled of leather oil and bad stew. Thorne's patrol crowded around their usual table, the conversation livelier than it had been in days.

Archer Venn balanced an apple on his knife point, spinning it lazily. "Twenty silver says the lantern has phoenix down in the wick. Only thing that explains it burning so long."

"Thirty says it's dwarven ever-oil," Darric countered, not looking up from the blade he was sharpening. "Stuff burns for weeks if you seal it right."

Fayne, sketching in his ever-present notebook, shook his head. "You're both wrong. It's will. Pure human will burning in that wick."

"Will doesn't keep fire alive," Kelen snorted, but there was less certainty in his voice than usual.

"Doesn't it?" Fayne looked up, his artist's eyes seeing more than most. "She willed herself through three days of hell. Willed herself to keep breathing poisoned air. Willed herself to keep that light burning. Maybe will is its own kind of fuel."

"Medically impossible," Halden stated, but his clinical tone was undermined by the wonder in his eyes. "The smoke inhalation alone should have killed her in hours. The dehydration, the burns, the psychological trauma... she should have died a dozen different ways."

"Maybe impossible needs a new definition," Venn suggested, catching the apple as it fell. "Maybe impossible is just what we call things before someone proves otherwise."

"Or maybe," Darric said quietly, "we're all overthinking it. Maybe she's just too mean to die."

That got a laugh, but it was warm, admiring.

"Speaking of impossible," Kelen said, pulling out a worn piece of parchment, "anyone else notice how she spotted that phosphorus blend at the dock fire? I've been doing this for fifteen years and I'd have doused it with water."

"And we'd all be dead," Venn said bluntly. "She saved our asses."

"She saved those civilians' asses," Halden corrected. "We were just following her lead."

Fayne held up his notebook, showing a detailed sketch: a lantern surrounded by a shield, with smoke rising to form the shape of wings. "Been working on this. Thought if the Commander—if Veyra—ever gets her own outfit running, they'll need heraldry."

"The Last Light Company," Thorne said from the doorway. They hadn't heard him enter. "That's what we're calling it."

The patrol exchanged glances. 

"We?" Kelen asked carefully.

"Anyone who wants in," Thorne said, joining them at the table. "It won't be official Watch work. It'll be dangerous. Probably thankless. Definitely underfunded."

"So, like regular Watch work but with worse pay?" Venn quipped.

"And better purpose," Thorne countered. "No more holding perimeters while people burn. No more protocol over lives."

"Where do we sign?" Darric asked immediately.

"You don't. Not yet." Thorne's expression was serious. "Think about it. Really think. Because once we start this, there's no halfway. Veyra doesn't do halfway."

"Neither do we," Kelen said firmly. "Not anymore."

They sat in companionable silence for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts. Finally, Venn raised his cup of terrible watchpost ale. "To impossible things."

"To impossible things," they echoed, and somehow the bad ale tasted better than usual.

Rain stitched silver lines between the torch-pools as Veyra eased onto a stone bench, her new walking stick balanced across her knees. The castle's guest quarters had been stifling; she needed air, even if it was wet and cold.

Thorne found her there, two steaming mugs in his hands. "Thought you might be out here."

"Couldn't sleep. The walls felt like they were closing in."

He handed her a mug and sat beside her, careful not to crowd. "Dokra's prescribed chamomile tea?"

She sniffed it suspiciously. "Smells like it. With something else... cinnamon?"

"Didn't think you should suffer alone." He sipped his own mug, grimacing slightly. "Though I'm starting to regret my compassion."

They sat in comfortable silence, watching fog roll in from the harbor, obscuring the city's lights one by one until only the brightest remained—like stars fallen to earth.

"The city's making you a legend," Thorne said eventually, his voice carefully neutral.

"Legends are for the dead," Veyra replied flatly.

"Then what are you?"

She considered the question, one hand unconsciously moving to the scars on her cheek. "Tired. Scarred. Angry." A pause. "Determined."

"That's four more things than the dead get to be."

"Lysander would have had something clever to say about that."

"Probably. But he's not here. You are."

"Lucky me," she said, but there was less bitterness in it than before.

"Lucky us," Thorne corrected gently. "The city needs someone who understands that fire isn't always the enemy. Sometimes it's the solution. Sometimes it's just what is, and you deal with it."

"Pretty philosophy, Captain."

"Practical philosophy. Learned it from someone who spent three days refusing to die."

Veyra turned to look at him properly. In the torch-light, his face was all planes and shadows, but his eyes were warm. "They're calling me things. Ash-Marked. Lanternlight Lass. The Canyon Ghost."

"Names have power," he said. "You can let them define you, or you can define them."

"And what would you call me?"

He considered. "Survivor. Leader. Friend." He paused. "If you'll allow it."

"I'm not good friend material right now, Thorne. I see ghosts. I talk to my lantern. I wake up screaming."

"Good thing I'm patient then."

She almost smiled—a small thing, but real. "The cult's still out there."

"Yes."

"They'll try again."

"Probably."

"And when they do?"

"We'll be ready. The Last Light Company will be ready."

She studied him. "You're serious about this. Building something new."

"Dead serious. The question is: are you in?"

Veyra looked out over the city—her city now, in a way it hadn't been before. Somewhere out there, people were telling stories about her. Some were true, some were wild fiction, but all of them ended the same way: the light endured.

"I'm in," she said quietly. "But we do this right. No half-measures. No politics. No leaving anyone behind."

"Agreed."

"And Thorne?" She touched his hand briefly, the contact surprising them both. "Thank you. For finding me. For believing this could work."

"Thank you for surviving long enough to be found."

They sat together as the rain softened to mist, two soldiers planning a revolution of compassion. Below them, Waterdeep slept, unaware that its newest legend was already planning her next impossible thing.

The lantern, sitting between them on the bench, burned steady and sure—a small light against the vast dark, but enough. More than enough.

It was a beginning.
