Let me analyze this chapter for visual storytelling moments. This is Chapter 2.5 "Echoes in the City" - a vignette chapter showing city reactions to Veyra's survival from the Canyon Incident.

First, let me understand the chapter structure:
1. Scene 1: Salamander's Hearth Tavern - common folk discussing Veyra's legend
2. Scene 2: Council Chambers - political maneuvering around the incident
3. Scene 3: Temple Steps - religious debate about divine intervention vs. human will
4. Scene 4: Guard Barracks - Thorne's patrol discussing the Company formation
5. Scene 5: Castle Balcony - Veyra and Thorne's quiet moment, her commitment

Characters appearing:
- Veyra Thornwake (published, has imagery.yaml) - appears in Scene 5
- Thorne Brightward (published, has imagery.yaml) - appears in Scenes 2, 4, 5
- Clerk Dena - minor character (no reference files)
- Preacher Amdir - minor character (no reference files)
- Mistress Dalra - minor character (no reference files)
- Various unnamed characters: Torrin, Sister Melka, Ralden, Gillthorn, courier, Therin, Archer Venn, Darric, Fayne, Kelen, Halden, etc.

Now let me evaluate potential visual moments through the Five Lenses:

**SCENE 1 - Salamander's Hearth:**

Moment 1A: "Mugs lifted throughout the tavern"
- Emotional Resonance: 4 (communal grief and hope)
- Visual Distinctiveness: 3 (tavern scene, somewhat generic)
- Narrative Pivot: 2 (sets tone but doesn't change direction)
- Character Revelation: 2 (shows community, not main characters)


- Symbolic Density: 4 (light/lantern motif, community around hearth)
Total: 15

Moment 1B: Courier announcement "She's awake"
- Emotional Resonance: 3 (news delivery)
- Visual Distinctiveness: 2 (fairly standard)
- Narrative Pivot: 3 (turning point in public knowledge)
- Character Revelation: 2 (minor character)
- Symbolic Density: 2
Total: 12 - borderline

I'll focus on the most compelling visual moments with high symbolic and emotional impact. The tavern scene's communal mug-lifting captures collective hope, while the courier's announcement represents a pivotal information spread. These moments reveal the city's emotional landscape after Veyra's survival.

The council chamber confrontation between Thorne and Therin emerges as a critical narrative junction. Intense political tension crackles through the scene, with Thorne's hand on his sword hilt symbolizing potential conflict. The platinum purse on the desk becomes a potent visual metaphor for power dynamics, suggesting hidden negotiations and unspoken threats.

Dena's calculated bureaucratic maneuver in burying Grimsby's complaint demonstrates institutional manipulation. Her quiet defiance transforms paperwork into a strategic weapon, revealing systemic power structures beneath seemingly mundane administrative actions.

The temple steps debate between Preacher Amdir and Mistress Dalra illuminates deeper societal fractures. Their philosophical confrontation, framed by the stark visual of charred wood and bread distribution, exposes fundamental tensions between divine authority and human survival. The symbolic richness emerges through contrasts: divine versus mortal perspectives, fear juxtaposed against basic sustenance.

The priestess's chalk lantern symbol represents a pivotal moment of collective hope. Her deliberate drawing crystallizes emerging legend, with the four-star lantern serving as a powerful visual metaphor of resilience. This seemingly simple act transforms an ordinary architectural surface into a canvas of communal aspiration.

In the guard barracks, Fayne's heraldry sketch becomes a profound moment of identity formation. The intricate drawing - a lantern encircled by a shield, with smoke subtly forming wings - symbolizes the emerging Company's nascent spirit. This visual representation captures their collective identity, transforming individual soldiers into a unified narrative.

The subsequent toast and Thorne's inclusive invitation further cement the group's emerging mythology. His statement "We? Anyone who wants in" signals an open, democratic approach to belonging, suggesting the Company transcends traditional military hierarchies.

On the castle balcony, Veyra emerges as a complex figure of resilience. Seated with her walking stick amid rolling fog and torch-lit darkness, she embodies a survivor's quiet introspection. The atmospheric scene - with lights like fallen stars disappearing into mist - powerfully communicates her internal struggle and vulnerability.

Her tentative physical connection with Thorne, symbolized by touching his hand, represents a profound moment of emerging trust and potential healing.

The final image of a lantern positioned between them crystallizes their nascent partnership, suggesting hope and a tentative new beginning. This moment feels pivotal, marking both a personal and narrative resolution.

I've selected key scenes that capture different narrative dimensions:

A heroic wide shot establishing Veyra's resilience, a pivotal moment where the Company's identity emerges through symbolic ritual, and an intimate character moment revealing vulnerability through a simple touch. These scenes provide visual and emotional range, tracking the story's arc from isolation to connection.

The selections span different emotional registers - from grand architectural landscapes to subtle interpersonal gestures - ensuring a comprehensive narrative exploration of the characters' transformative journey.

I'm carefully balancing scene variety, ensuring each location offers a distinct perspective: castle heights, temple steps, guard quarters, each contributing a unique visual and thematic texture to the emerging legend.

The tavern moment's strength lies in its sensory detail - the soft rain's percussion outside contrasting with the warm hearthfire's intimate glow. The raised mugs represent a concrete, communal gesture of solidarity, more visually compelling than abstract atmospheric descriptions.

I'm selecting moments that crystallize the narrative's emotional and symbolic core: Veyra's fog-shrouded balcony scene establishing wide emotional context, the priestess marking her symbolic lantern, and the intimate physical connection between characters.

The scene selection requires careful navigation of structural rules - ensuring no consecutive moments emerge from the same scene while maintaining narrative depth and visual variety. Each moment must serve a distinct narrative function: establishing shots, character dynamics, political tensions, and community spirit.

I've mapped character focus across multiple scenes, verifying primary character involvement. The visual progression traces an emotional landscape: communal warmth transforms through political complexity into intimate connection, with lighting shifting from tavern amber to temple stone to soft lantern glow.

The visual journey suggests an arc of connection - from broad community celebration through institutional conflict to personal understanding. Each selected moment illuminates a different relational scale: collective, institutional, and interpersonal.

Color transitions reinforce this emotional trajectory: warm honey gold yields to misty grays, ultimately resolving in night's intimate blue tones. The palette itself narrates a journey from expansive public energy to concentrated personal hope.
