    name: "Veyra Thornwake"
    scene_variations: |
      This chapter: Veyra is recovering from the Canyon Incident. She uses a WALKING STICK (new, wooden, plain) and moves with careful fragility rather than her usual grounded stillness. The burn scar is unchanged. Her gear is intact but she appears thinner, more exhausted—the survivor beneath the legend.

    name: "Thorne Brightward"
    scene_variations: |
      This chapter: Scene 2 (council chambers) - Thorne wears his faded blue cloak but NOT full armor; instead, a formal leather jerkin suitable for political meetings. His sword is at his hip. The gold sunburst sigil patch is prominent on his cloak. His hand rests on his sword hilt—not gripping, just present.

        chapter_context: |
          A working-class tavern with blackened timber beams aged to near-black, painted amber by hanging oil-lanterns. A commanding central hearthfire dominates the space, casting flickering warmth across scarred wooden tables and worn benches. The ceiling beams catch the light like honey on old wood. Smoke hangs in the upper air. The atmosphere is reverent despite the humble materials—a chapel built from ale and ash.

  - ref: "council-chambers"
    zones:
      - id: "overview"
        chapter_context: |
          A cramped bureaucratic office drowning in parchment. Sepia light filters through unseen windows, illuminating dust motes over cluttered desks. Filing cabinets and document stacks frame the space. Political geometry in the desk arrangement—power expressed through furniture. Browns and tans dominate except for one jarring note: a small platinum purse sitting on the desk, catching light unnaturally bright against the dull surroundings.

    zones:
      - id: "overview"
        chapter_context: |
          Wide marble steps ascending into gray mist, grand buttresses looming overhead half-swallowed by dawn fog. The architecture is imposing—carved stone, religious grandeur—but the fog softens all edges. A crowd compressed between street level and divine architecture; common clay meeting sacred stone. Blank pillars wait for devotion to mark them.

    zones:
      - id: "overview"
        chapter_context: |
          A functional military mess hall: scarred wooden tables and benches, oil-lamps hanging from low beams, the smell of leather oil and bad stew made visible in the air. Watchmen's gear hangs on pegs. The space is utilitarian but warmed by camaraderie—soldiers at rest, sharing space and purpose.

      - id: "overview"
        chapter_context: |
          A liminal space between shelter and storm. Stone bench cold and hard, balustrade separating the viewer from the void beyond. Rain stitches silver lines between distant torch-pools in the city below. Fog rolls in from the harbor, swallowing lights one by one until only the brightest remain like fallen stars. The nearest torch creates a small island of amber warmth against vast rain-silver darkness.

      A half-full tavern at the moment of shared toast. Working-class hands raise foam-topped tankards throughout the frame. Oil-lanterns paint the blackened ceiling beams honey-amber.

      Veyra Thornwake sits alone on a cold stone bench at a castle balcony. Small figure against vast dark. Walking stick across knees. Burn scar catches nearest torch-pool light. Beyond balustrade, fog swallows city lights. Rain silver lines. Lantern at hip glows warm but small.
    composition_notes: |
      Ultra-wide. Veyra left third. Fog/rain void right two-thirds. High angle emphasizes vulnerability. Torch creates amber rim light on profile.
    visual_hook: "The walking stick—a detail that grounds her as recovering, not triumphant."

      Extreme close focus on two hands meeting briefly. Veyra's hand (tattooed, lean) touches Thorne's hand (ruddy, broader, scarred). Touch is light. Between them, lantern glows warm amber on bench. Rain-mist darkness background. Walking stick and mugs nearby.
    composition_notes: |
      Square format. Hands center focal point. Lantern below center. Rule of thirds: hands meet at center. Background dissolves into dark.
