Lady Moira Blackwater's office was a study in controlled efficiency. Maps covered one wall, marked with colored pins that spoke of ongoing operations across the region. A second wall held bookshelves filled with intelligence reports, while the third displayed a collection of weapons that looked both decorative and functional. The morning light streaming through tall windows illuminated documents spread across a polished mahogany table.

Veyra, Thorne, and Marcus sat across from Lady Moira, who reviewed their intelligence summary with professional interest. Captain Grimsby stood behind her, his expression carefully neutral as he studied the architectural drawings and surveillance reports they'd compiled.

"Concerning intelligence," Lady Moira said finally, setting down the last document. "While your information from Master Vexweld's observations and the water memory readings is valuable, it confirms our worst fears about the operation's scope—and highlights how much we still don't know." She looked up, meeting Veyra's eyes directly. "We need eyes-on reconnaissance before any rescue attempt can be planned."

"How so?" Thorne asked.

"Based on the shipping manifests and Master Threnx's unwitting descriptions to Miss Vexweld, the level of sophistication suggests backing from someone with significant resources," Grimsby replied. "But we're operating on secondhand observations and circumstantial evidence. We need direct intelligence."

Lady Moira nodded grimly. "Our own agents have encountered... complications. The Silent Hand has been operating in that region for months, and they've likely identified most of our regular operatives. We need people they won't recognize—and skills our people frankly lack." She looked directly at Veyra. "This is exactly the type of situation your Company was designed to handle."

"Which brings us to the delicate matter of Master Threnx and Miss Vexweld," she continued, consulting her notes. "Your assessment is that both are innocent of any knowledge regarding the facility's true purpose?"

"Completely," Marcus confirmed. "Cid trusts us implicitly, and her descriptions of Korrath's work patterns suggest he believes he's working on a legitimate agricultural project. They're both potential assets, but also potential victims if we move without proper intelligence."

"And the timeline?"

Vera had been quietly observing from her chair near the window. "Days, not weeks. The water signs suggest increased activity at the facility. If they're preparing to relocate the captives, we need eyes-on reconnaissance immediately—we can't rescue what we can't find."

Thorne leaned forward, studying the regional map spread across the table. "Travel logistics will be critical. The main road is the only practical route for the first day—the terrain forces us that way."

"Agreed," Grimsby said, tracing the route with his finger. "Don't we have an asset in that area? Someone along the main road?"

Marcus exchanged glances with Veyra. "The one off the main road? I've heard... stories."

"Ah, yes—The Windborne Roost," Lady Moira said, consulting her notes. "It's a legitimate establishment—market stalls, proper stables for horses and carriages, rooms for travelers. But it also serves as a discreet waystation for City Watch operations when needed. The proprietor, Quierk, is an aarakocra who's worked with us for years. Entirely trustworthy and has an excellent view of the road from his perch."

"A black-site tavern," Veyra mused. "Clever cover."

"The perfect place to resupply before going off-road," Thorne noted. "We could take the main route openly, restock there, then disappear into the woods for the final approach to the facility."

"You'll need some form of disguise for the main road," Grimsby observed. "A group like yours draws attention."

Lady Moira studied the team for a moment before responding. "Your rescue and extraction skills are proven—the Library operation demonstrated that beyond doubt. Your operational doctrine of 'Total Asset Recovery' is sound, but it requires accurate intelligence to execute."

She leaned forward, her expression growing more serious. "However, this mission requires more than rescue skills. The Silent Hand is not a military garrison to be scouted from the outside. They are a clandestine network hiding in plain sight. Their primary defense isn't walls or guards; it's secrecy. To beat them, we can't just observe their perimeter; we must get inside their decision-making process."

"You need human intelligence," Marcus stated, understanding her implication.

"Precisely," Lady Moira affirmed. "And while your team is the scalpel I would choose for any rescue, you are not interrogators or deep-cover agents. Asking you to perform that role would be a misuse of your talents and would risk the entire operation. This phase requires a specialist."

She stood, a subtle smile playing at her lips. "We need someone with a very specific skill set. Someone who can infiltrate without detection, extract information through... unconventional means, and handle situations where the required skills fall outside your Company's experience. Particularly if a situation calls for a... permanent resolution."

Veyra's eyes narrowed slightly. "We have Marcus for intelligence work."

"Mr. Heartbridge is talented," Lady Moira acknowledged with a nod toward Marcus, "but this requires someone who was trained from childhood for this exact type of work. Someone who can become anyone, open any door, and eliminate threats if absolutely necessary."

Marcus leaned forward, understanding beginning to dawn in his expression. "You have someone in mind."

"I do." Lady Moira's smile grew slightly wider. "They're currently... residing with us."

She moved toward the door, gesturing for them to follow. "Shall we?"

Grimsby looked confused as he fell into step behind them. "Residing with—where are we going?"

Lady Moira didn't answer directly, leading them out of her office and into the corridor. "You'll understand soon enough, Captain."

The group followed Lady Moira through the interconnected buildings of the City Watch complex, moving from the administrative warmth of the Shield Hall across the Bridge of Scrutiny into the more austere corridors of the Spire of Inquiry. The atmosphere changed subtly as they progressed—fewer clerks bustling about, more security checkpoints, and an increasing sense of entering restricted territory.

Thorne's expression grew increasingly uncomfortable as they descended a series of stairs, each level taking them deeper into the building's secure areas. The décor shifted from polished wood and brass fixtures to reinforced stone and iron doors.

"Lady Moira," Thorne said, his voice carrying a note of tension, "the high-security detention level is for—"

"Exceptional individuals who require exceptional containment," Lady Moira finished smoothly, not breaking stride.

Marcus's quick mind was already putting the pieces together. "You're talking about a prisoner. A high-value prisoner."

"I prefer to think of them as a temporarily restricted asset," Lady Moira replied, approaching another checkpoint where two guards snapped to attention.

"Director Blackwater," one acknowledged, checking a ledger. "Authorized visitors?"

"My guests have temporary clearance under Protocol Seven," she replied, producing a document with several official seals.

The guards examined it carefully before stepping aside. The heavy iron door swung open with a groan that spoke of significant weight and security.

Grimsby was looking increasingly bewildered. "What kind of prisoner requires this level of—"

His question died as they entered the high-security detention block. These weren't typical cells—each was a carefully constructed containment unit designed for individuals too dangerous or valuable for standard imprisonment. Magical wards hummed faintly in the air, and the walls were lined with sound-dampening materials.

Lady Moira led them past several occupied cells, their occupants hidden behind solid doors with only small viewing slots. She stopped at a particular cell near the end of the corridor, distinguished by additional security measures including what appeared to be anti-magic fields.

Through the reinforced bars, they could see an immaculate space that bore little resemblance to a typical prison cell. Books were stacked in precise formations on a small shelf. Delicate wood carvings lined another shelf—birds, animals, abstract designs, all carved with extraordinary detail. Sketches covered one wall in an organized gallery, and everything was arranged with almost obsessive precision.

The cell's occupant sat at a small table, a piece of wood in one hand and a small carving knife in the other, adding minute details to what appeared to be a miniature dragon. She was a tiefling, her deep plum-colored skin catching the filtered light from the cell's small window. Elegant horns curved back from her temples, filed to smooth points, while her long auburn hair is secured in a tight bun with what appeared to be an ornate hairpin. Her golden eyes, sharp and calculating, never left her work even as footsteps approached.

"I believe you're familiar with our guest, Captain Brightward," Lady Moira said with subtle amusement.

Thorne stepped forward, his entire body going rigid as recognition hit. His voice came out tight, barely above a whisper. "Mockingbird."

The tiefling woman looked up from her carving, golden eyes finding Thorne with mild surprise that quickly shifted to wry amusement. She set down her tools with deliberate precision and stood with fluid grace, the movement accentuating her elegant horns and the subtle shimmer of her plum-colored skin.

"Captain Brightward," Lyra said, her voice carrying a blend of respect and irony. "I was wondering when you'd visit. Eight months of chase, and you never came to gloat?"

Grimsby's intake of breath was audible as the pieces clicked into place. "Mockingbird? THE Mockingbird? The Lullaby Murders?"

Lyra's lips curved into a dry smile, the expression highlighting the elegant bone structure of her tiefling features. "Among other things. Though I prefer to think of those as my humanitarian phase." She tilted her head, her horns catching the light as she studied the group with the calculating gaze of someone always measuring angles and distances. "Lady Blackwater, an official visit with guests? Let me guess—something impossible needs doing, your regular assets have failed, and someone remembered the ghost operative gathering dust in your cellar."

"This is who you want us to work with?" Veyra asked, her voice carefully neutral as she studied the imprisoned woman.

"Miss Kestrel possesses every skill your mission requires," Lady Moira replied. "Master infiltration, voice mimicry, psychological manipulation, and when necessary, the ability to permanently resolve problems."

Thorne's jaw was clenched so tight it looked painful. "You're a killer."

Lyra's knife stopped. Just for a heartbeat—a crack in the careful performance, revealing something underneath that made even Lady Moira's guards shift uneasily. Her golden eyes flicked up, and what looked out from them wasn't the wry, controlled professional they'd been speaking with. It was something older. Something that had learned to bite before it learned to smile.

The intricate tattoos along her arms flickered with violet light—brief, like heat lightning—and her voice dropped to something cold and precise. The kind of voice that made you understand, viscerally, why people whispered about the Mockingbird.

"I have *killed*," she said, the word carrying weight that made the air feel thinner. "I am not a *killer*. There is a difference. One is an action. The other is an identity. Choose your words more carefully, Captain."

She rose from her chair, her movements sharp and predatory. "Every one of those early contracts? They were monsters. Slavers, corrupt nobles, men who preyed on the weak. They deserved what they got. I was a scalpel, removing a cancer." Her gaze flickered towards Lady Moira, her expression dripping with contempt as she gestured vaguely at the ceiling. "It was only when THESE people... this organization... started twisting my purpose that things changed. They pointed me at targets without context, fed me lies, and turned my skills into a tool for their petty tyrannies. They made me an unknowing murderer. That is a stain I will never forgive."

Lady Moira met her furious gaze without flinching, her expression one of cool assessment. "I won't defend the actions of all my predecessors," she said, her tone even but firm. "Some of them did indeed... sour. They allowed personal agendas to compromise the integrity of this office. They have been dealt with."

Lyra laughed, a sharp, bitter sound. "'Dealt with.' How tidy." She took a step closer to the bars, her eyes locking onto Moira's. "Let me be perfectly clear. You point me at a target, you give me a mission, you had better be telling me the entire truth. If I find out you've used me to harm an innocent, or to serve some grubby political end... there is no cell deep enough to hide you from me. I will find you."

"Your passion is noted, Miss Kestrel," Lady Moira said, completely unfazed. "And your condition is accepted. This organization values results, and so do you. Let us speak of the arrangement."

"The proposal is simple," Moira continued, shifting back to business. "You assist with a reconnaissance mission. Complete it successfully, and I'll recommend a reduction in your sentence."

Lyra's eyes sharpened. "And my crew?"

Lady Moira consulted a file. "Scattered. Some imprisoned, some fled the city. Your intelligence operative, Silas, disappeared completely after providing the information that led to your capture."

Something dangerous flashed in Lyra's golden eyes at the mention of Silas, but she controlled it quickly. "Are the others alive?"

"Those we captured are serving sentences. No executions."

Lyra nodded slowly. "My cooperation for consideration on their sentences." It wasn't a question.

"Dependent on your performance," Lady Moira said carefully.

"Fine." Lyra's gaze swept over them again, lingering on Thorne. "You caught me fair and square, Captain. You're the only one who ever got close. Eight months of cat and mouse, and you never gave up, never fell for the false trails. It was... impressive."

"Flattery won't help you," Thorne replied, though his voice lacked some of its earlier coldness. He had seen something else in her, a crack in the amoral facade.

"It's not flattery, it's honest assessment," Lyra said. "I respect competence. It's why I'm willing to consider this." She looked at Veyra. "You want to know if you can trust me? Here's the truth—I take pride in my craft. Give me a job, and I'll complete it with excellence. That's the only trust that matters."

Marcus and Veyra exchanged glances. Veyra gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod.

"We'll need to discuss this," Veyra said finally. "But for now, we are... considering the arrangement."

"Of course," Lady Moira replied. "Though time is a factor." She paused, letting the weight of her next words settle. "And there is one more detail you should be aware of. The captives at the facility... the Silent Hand are not just holding prisoners. They are slavers. And their cargo includes children."

This time, Lyra didn't crack. She *broke*.

The change was nothing like her earlier flash of dangerous anger. That had been the predator showing its teeth. This was something else entirely—something raw and wounded that made even Thorne look away for a moment, uncomfortable with witnessing something so private.

Her golden eyes went distant, as if she was seeing something far beyond the prison walls. The violet light in her tattoos guttered and died, leaving her looking suddenly smaller, younger. Her hands trembled—not with rage, but with something closer to grief.

"Children," she whispered, and her voice had lost all its edges. Just a woman, sitting in a cell, confronting an old wound that had never really healed. "How many?"

"We don't have exact numbers. Potentially dozens."

Lyra closed her eyes. When she opened them again, the tears she wouldn't let fall made her golden irises gleam like coins at the bottom of a wishing well.

"I have a niece and a nephew," she said quietly. "Elena is seven. Marcus is five. When I close my eyes at night, I think about what would happen if someone took them. If they woke up in a cage, wondering why no one came for them." Her voice cracked, just slightly. "Every child I saved in those operations—every single one—I saw my niece's face. My nephew's face. That's not politics. That's not ideology. That's the only thing left of me that's still *good*."

She looked at Veyra, and there was no performance left. Just truth, laid bare.

"Point me at slavers who traffic children, and I will unmake their world. Not because I'm a weapon. Not because you're paying me. Because there are some evils that don't get to exist while I'm still breathing."

Thorne watched her, his expression complex. He spoke quietly, his words directed at Veyra and Marcus but loud enough for all to hear. "That's the one thing I know she never lied about. During the Lullaby investigation, we found the trusts. Anonymous, but we traced them. Every target was a corrupt official involved in trafficking. And for every one, a trust was set up for the victims' families. When we arrested her, her only demands were that her niece and nephew be provided for. It's real."

Lyra didn't acknowledge Thorne's words, her focus entirely on Lady Moira. "The mission is no longer a negotiation," she stated. "It's a requirement. When do we start?"

Lady Moira allowed herself a small, satisfied smile. "I thought you might see it that way."

"We'll need to discuss this," Veyra said finally.

"Of course," Lady Moira replied. "Though time is a factor. The children at that facility don't have the luxury of extended deliberation."

After a brief, intense discussion in the corridor—with Thorne arguing vehemently against the arrangement while Marcus pointed out the practical benefits—they returned to Lyra's cell.

"These are the terms," Veyra announced. "You'll be released into Captain Brightward's custody for this mission. You'll wear a tracking device at all times. Any attempt to escape, any harm to team members, any deviation from the mission parameters, and you return here immediately."

"And if I succeed?" Lyra asked.

"We'll support Lady Moira's recommendation for sentence reduction."

Lyra considered this, her fingers unconsciously working through the motions of lock-picking with the supernatural dexterity of her tiefling heritage. "I want something in writing about consideration for my crew's sentences."

"Dependent on your behavior and success," Thorne said firmly.

"Fair enough." Lyra stood, moving to the bars with the fluid grace of someone who'd spent years perfecting economy of movement. "When do we leave?"

"First, you'll need to convince my team you're not a threat," Veyra said. "They have to work with you, trust you enough for operational success."

Lyra's smile was sharp. "Commander Thornwake, I can become anyone, sound like anyone, and open any lock ever made. I've killed corrupt nobles with their mother's lullabies and saved children from trafficking rings. I'm not trying to convince anyone I'm not a threat—I'm absolutely a threat. The question is whether I'm YOUR threat or theirs."

"Tomorrow morning," Lady Moira said, producing a set of documents. "Guards will escort Miss Kestrel to your warehouse complex at dawn. Captain Grimsby, please prepare the necessary security protocols."

As they prepared to leave, Lyra called out. "Captain Brightward."

Thorne turned, his expression still hard.

"That night in the Cassian vault," she said quietly. "When you caught me. You could have killed me—I had weapons, you had justification. Why didn't you?"

Thorne was silent for a moment. "Because I'm not you."

Lyra offered a slow, unreadable nod, her expression giving nothing away. "No," she agreed softly. "You're not."

As the heavy door to the detention block boomed shut, leaving her once again in the quiet of her cell, she turned back to her workbench. She picked up a half-finished carving of a bird, her fingers tracing its delicate lines. A faint, bitter smile touched her lips.

"You have no idea who I am," she whispered to the silence.

The journey from the high-security detention block back to the administrative levels of the Spire of Inquiry was a study in contrasts. Down in the depths, the only sounds had been their own footsteps and the faint hum of magical wards. As they ascended, the sounds of a living, breathing headquarters returned: the distant ring of a blacksmith's hammer, the murmur of conversations, the scrape of boots on stone.

And then, the whispers started.

Lyra walked in the center of their formation, her hands bound before her in heavy iron cuffs, the metal scraping softly with each step. She was flanked by four grim-faced guards, a human shield for the city's most infamous prisoner. Despite the restraints, she moved with an unnerving grace, her head held high, her golden eyes taking in everything with a calm, analytical gaze that seemed to miss nothing. Veyra and Marcus walked ahead, clearing a path, while Lady Moira, Thorne, and a still-bewildered Captain Grimsby followed behind.

Clerks and off-duty guards would flatten themselves against the walls as the procession approached. Conversations would die, replaced by a sudden, tense silence, followed by a wave of hushed murmurs in their wake.

"Is that...?"

"...the Mockingbird. Gods, I thought she was just a story."

A young watchman, barely old enough to shave, paled as she passed. He leaned over to his veteran partner. "The Mockingbird? I thought she was just a tale you tell rookies to scare them."

His partner didn't take his eyes off Lyra. "She's real enough, kid. And twice as dangerous as the stories say."

From a records clerk peeking out of a doorway: "My mother told me stories about her to make me behave... said the Mockingbird would come and sing me a lullaby I'd never wake up from."

Lyra gave no indication that she heard any of it, her expression serene. But Thorne, walking behind her, saw the subtle, almost imperceptible tightening of her jaw. She was listening to every word.

"Her reputation precedes her," Grimsby muttered to Lady Moira, clearly unnerved by the palpable fear she generated.

"A reputation is a tool, Captain," Moira replied quietly, her voice pitched for only him and Thorne to hear. "And right now, we need the sharpest tool in the city. The fear she inspires is a part of that."

Thorne remained silent, his gaze fixed on the tiefling woman who had consumed eight months of his life. He had hunted a legend, and now he was walking beside the reality, finding her far more complex and unsettling than any story.

The corridor leading away from the detention cells branched toward a series of administrative chambers. Lady Moira guided them to a heavy oak door marked with the seal of the City Watch's Arcane Division—a stylized eye surrounded by interlocking circles representing detection magic.

"Wizard Aldrich," Lady Moira announced as they entered the chamber. "We have a temporary release requiring standard monitoring protocols."

The court wizard looked up from a workbench covered in delicate magical instruments. He was a thin man with prematurely gray hair and the precise movements of someone who worked regularly with dangerous energies. His robes bore the blue and silver of official Watch service, but the fabric was practical rather than ceremonial.

"Ah, the Mockingbird," he said, recognizing Lyra immediately. His tone was professional, neither hostile nor friendly. "I'll need the standard placement enchantment and location tracking matrix."

From a locked drawer, he retrieved what appeared to be a simple silver pendant on a thin chain, though closer inspection revealed intricate engravings along its surface that seemed to shift and writhe when viewed directly.

"Please lean forward," Wizard Aldrich instructed, his manner clinical. "This will feel cold for a moment, then warm as the enchantment attunes to your magical signature."

Lyra complied without resistance, allowing him to place the chain around her neck. The wizard fastened the pendant with practiced efficiency, speaking a brief incantation under his breath. The silver piece contracted slightly against her throat, fitting snugly but not uncomfortably, and began to emit a faint, barely visible glow beneath her collar.

"The enchantment provides continuous location monitoring within a fifty-mile radius of Waterdeep," Aldrich explained to the group. "Any attempt at removal triggers immediate alerts. Any magical interference with the device triggers immediate alerts. Any movement beyond the authorized range triggers immediate alerts."

He looked directly at Lyra. "It also monitors for certain magical signatures—teleportation, dimension door, any form of magical escape or concealment. The device is designed specifically for operatives with your... skill set."

"Understood," Lyra replied, her fingers briefly touching the pendant where it rested against her collarbone. "How often does it report my location?"

"Continuously, with position updates every ten minutes during active monitoring," Aldrich said. "Captain Brightward will carry the corresponding tracking crystal." He handed Thorne a small, clear crystal that pulses with the same faint light as Lyra's pendant. "Distance, direction, and general status are always visible. More detailed information requires specific inquiry spells."

Thorne pocketed the crystal, his expression grim but resigned. "How long before the enchantment is fully active?"

"Immediate for location tracking. Full magical monitoring takes approximately an hour to calibrate to her specific magical signature." Aldrich made a note in his logbook. "Standard protocols require the subject to remain within the building during calibration."

Lady Moira consulted a pocket watch. "Which gives us time to complete the paperwork and final briefings. Perfect timing."

The next morning, the warehouse complex was tense with anticipation. Word had spread that they'd be working with a "government specialist," though Veyra had kept the exact details limited. Grimjaw was at his forge, the rhythmic hammering providing a backdrop to the nervous energy. Aldwin was organizing medical supplies, while Vera sat in a corner, Echo perched on her shoulder as she reviewed maps.

The arrival was deliberately low-key—an unmarked Watch wagon with Lieutenant Tomaq driving and two guards in the back. Lyra stepped out with calculated grace, wearing simple but well-made traveling clothes that had probably been selected from evidence lockup. Her movements were economical, precise, those of someone who never wasted energy on unnecessary motion.

"Everyone," Veyra announced as they entered The Mess, "this is Lyra Kestrel. She's been assigned by Lady Moira to accompany our reconnaissance mission."

The reaction was immediate and varied. Grimjaw's hammering stopped. Aldwin looked up with polite interest that shifted to wariness as he registered Thorne's tension. Vera's eyes narrowed, studying the newcomer with the intensity of one predator recognizing another.

Lyra stepped forward, and when she spoke, her voice carried the exact tone and inflection Veyra had just used: "She's been assigned by Lady Moira to accompany our reconnaissance mission."

As she spoke in Veyra's voice, wisps of darker purple shadow danced around her throat, the visible manifestation of her tiefling-enhanced abilities. The mimicry was perfect—not just the words, but the subtle concern, the weight of command, even the slight hesitation that had colored Veyra's introduction.

Then, switching back to her own voice—a carefully neutral tone that gave away nothing: "Apologies. Professional habit. I'm a specialist in infiltration, intelligence gathering, and... problem resolution."

"Voice mimicry," Marcus observed with evident appreciation. "How long do you need to capture someone's vocal patterns?"

"Thirty seconds for basic replication," Lyra replied, clearly recognizing a kindred operative. "Five minutes for complete personality mapping including emotional ranges and speech patterns. You're Marcus Heartbridge—I've heard about your work. Elegant psychological manipulation, building trust before extraction. We're in similar businesses, just different methodologies."

"How different?" Aldwin asked carefully.

Lyra considered the question. "You heal people, Doctor. Marcus convinces them to heal themselves. I... expedite solutions when talking fails." She paused. "Though I'm told this mission prioritizes non-lethal approaches. I can work within those parameters."

Grimjaw had been studying her with the eye of someone who understood dangerous tools. "You're the Mockingbird. The Lullaby Killer."

"Former," Lyra corrected. "I'm reformed now. Mostly." The dry humor didn't quite mask something deeper. "Those operations were government-sanctioned, for what it's worth. Corrupt officials using their positions to traffic children. The methods were extreme, but twenty-three children went home to their families."

"By killing their captors with their loved ones' voices," Vera said quietly. It wasn't quite an accusation, more an assessment.

"By using every tool at my disposal to achieve the objective," Lyra replied, meeting Vera's gaze directly. "Just as you use tracking, he uses medicine, and she uses leadership. We all have our specialties."

The room was quiet for a moment, tension thick in the air.

"Look," Lyra said, her tone shifting to something more genuine. "I know what I am. I know what I've done. I'm not asking for your friendship or approval. I'm offering my skills for this mission because the alternative is children dying in that facility while I rot in a cell. Whatever you think of my methods, I'm very, very good at what I do."

She pulled out a small wooden carving from her pocket—a perfect miniature of a raven, carved with extraordinary detail. She offered it to Vera. "I had time in my cell. Your companion is quite distinctive. Echo, isn't it?"

Vera accepted the carving with surprise, examining the intricate work. It was perfect down to individual feathers.

"You were watching us?" Vera asked.

"The cell has a very small window," Lyra explained. "You can see the training courtyard from certain angles. I've observed your team for weeks. It helped pass the time, and... know your allies as well as your enemies."

Thorne stepped forward. "Let's be clear about the rules. You follow orders. You don't harm innocents. You don't steal unless mission-critical. You don't disappear. Break any of these—"

"Back to the cell," Lyra finished. "Captain, you spent eight months learning exactly how disciplined I can be. That hasn't changed just because the venue has."

As evening approached, the warehouse complex took on the focused energy that preceded dangerous missions. Equipment was checked, supplies were packed, and final contingencies were discussed.

In a quiet corner of the training yard, Lyra moved through a series of fluid, deadly forms. Her twin kukri blades, returned from evidence lockup, were dark blurs in the fading light. The movements were economical and precise, but Thorne, watching from a distance, noticed a faint stiffness in her shoulders, a slight hesitation in a complex transition that wouldn't have been there years ago. The muscle memory was there, but the long months of inactivity in a cell had left their mark. She was a master musician picking up her instrument after a long silence, the notes still true but the effortless virtuosity needing to be coaxed back.

As she finished a final, spinning flourish, a voice cut through the quiet. "Those are fine blades."

Lyra's head snapped up, her eyes instantly locking onto Sergeant Kelen, who had approached quietly. He nodded toward the kukris in her hands, his expression one of genuine interest, not suspicion.

"You have a good eye for a city watchman," Lyra said, her tone cautious. It was rare for a typical guard to appreciate the specific balance and make of a blade designed for her kind of work.

"I wasn't always a city watchman," Kelen replied with a slight smile. "May I?" He held out a hand.

Lyra paused, her eyes searching his for any sign of a trick. It was an intimate thing, to hand over one's weapons. After a moment, she made a decision and offered him the blades, hilts-first. 

Kelen took them, his grip sure and familiar. He tested their weight, then moved through a basic cutting form. His movements weren't as fluid or as blindingly fast as Lyra's, but his form was solid, his footwork precise. There was an economy of motion that spoke of real training.

"You've handled a kukri before," Lyra observed, a note of genuine surprise in her voice.

"A few times, in a past life," Kelen said, handing them back with a respectful nod. "They're well-balanced. You take good care of them."

Lyra took her blades back, a flicker of unexpected respect in her eyes. The sergeant was more than he seemed. It was a detail worth remembering.

Nearby, Vera and Aldwin were focused on Thorne. "Hold still," Vera murmured, her fingers tracing a glowing pattern on his cheekbones. "This will only work if the glamour settles properly."

Aldwin held a small, bubbling vial. "Drink this. It will alter your voice just enough. With the glamour changing your features, you should be unrecognizable. A traveling sellsword is a common enough sight." Thorne's position as a Watch-Captain was too well-known to risk him being seen on the road.

Veyra gathered the final team members around the central table, where Grimjaw was pointedly sharpening his axe. "The reconnaissance team will be myself, our specialist, Rill, Halden, Venn, and Captain Brightward."

Thorne nodded, his face already looking subtly different under the shimmering magic. "I have to go. She's my responsibility." The unspoken 'and I don't trust her' hung in the air.

Veyra placed a hand on Grimjaw's shoulder. "Grimjaw, you're in command here while I'm gone. Coordinate with the Watch and have the rest of the Company ready to move on our signal."

The dwarf grunted his assent, not looking up from his whetstone. "They'll be ready."

Marcus approached the table, laying out a fresh set of documents. "Lady Moira and I have worked out the cover story," he announced. "You're representatives of Millbrook Agricultural Supplies, conducting a regional assessment for the spring planting season. It's mundane enough to be believable."

Lyra, having finished her practice, joined the group, wiping her blades clean. "Agricultural merchants? I can work with that," she said, her breathing only slightly labored. "I've played merchant, noble, servant, priest—a farmer is actually easier than most. People expect them to be practical and slightly suspicious of outsiders."

Marcus leaned forward. "Your ability to mimic voices could be invaluable for gathering intelligence, but it also makes you dangerous to the team. How do we know you won't use our voices against us?"

Lyra met his gaze directly. "Because that would be unprofessional, and despite what you might think, I have standards. I've never betrayed a client or a crew. Silas taught me the cost of that particular breach of ethics."

As they prepared to depart in the pre-dawn darkness, Veyra gathered her reconnaissance team around one of the loaded wagons. "This mission is different from anything we've done before. We're working with someone whose methods we don't approve of, but whose skills we need."

She looked at each member of her small team, then made direct eye contact with Lyra. "That includes you. You're part of this team for this mission. We protect each other."

Lyra straightened slightly, something flickering in her expression—surprise, perhaps even a touch of vulnerability before her careful mask reasserted itself. "Understood, Commander. Though I should point out that usually I'm the one people need protection from."

"Not on my team," Veyra said firmly.

The wagons rolled out into Waterdeep's dark streets, carrying an unlikely alliance toward an uncertain future. Behind them, the warehouse complex faded into shadow, while ahead, the Silent Hand facility waited with its terrible secrets.
