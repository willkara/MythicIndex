      His profile is toward the viewer, faded blue cloak visible over his shoulder. Beyond
      the bars, Lyra Kestrel looks up from her carving table with wry amusement, golden eyes
      finding his. Her deep plum tiefling skin catches the small window's light. Elegant
      horns curve back from her temples. Auburn hair secured in severe bun. Wood shavings

      Bars create visual separation and frame both figures. Thorne in foreground left,

      Wide shot looking through reinforced bars into Lyra's immaculate cell. The space
      bears no resemblance to a typical prison—it is an artist's studio rendered in
      miniature. Books are stacked in precise geometric formations on a small shelf.
      Delicate wood carvings line another shelf: birds captured mid-flight, animals
      in lifelike poses, abstract spiraling designs, each carved with extraordinary
      detail. Sketches cover one wall in an organized gallery, arranged by subject
      or technique. A small table holds carving tools laid out with surgical precision.
      Lyra sits at the table in warm light from a small window, her plum skin luminous,
      working on a miniature with focused absorption.

      Through-the-bars framing creates voyeuristic intimacy. Wide angle captures the

      A few wood shavings cling to her fingers from her earlier carving work.
      The hands of an artist, the hands of an assassin, now just the hands of a woman
      remembering the faces of her niece and nephew on every child she ever saved.

      Wide shot of the Watch headquarters corridor. Lyra walks at the center of a guard

      she moves with unnerving grace, head held high, golden eyes taking in everything.
      Her deep plum skin and elegant horns mark her as distinctly tiefling. Flanking her
      are grim-faced guards. In the foreground left, a young watchman presses himself
      against the wall, his face pale. His veteran partner stands nearby, unable to take
      his eyes off the prisoner. In the background, clerks have stopped mid-motion,
      documents frozen in hand. The wake of whispers is almost visible—conversations
      dying as she passes. Veyra and Marcus lead the way ahead, while Thorne follows
      behind with Lady Moira.

      Medium two-shot of Veyra and Lyra in the pre-dawn darkness of the warehouse
      training yard. Lantern light provides warm illumination. Veyra stands facing
      Lyra, her burn-scarred face serious, dark mohawk and feathered braids visible.
      She makes direct eye contact—the commander claiming her responsibility.
      Lyra has straightened slightly from her previous relaxed stance, something
      flickering in her expression: surprise, perhaps vulnerability, before her
      careful mask begins to reassert itself. Her golden eyes are caught between
      distrust and an unfamiliar hope. Behind them, loaded wagons wait for departure.
      The moment is private despite others nearby.
