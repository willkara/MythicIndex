  prompt: 'Political tension scene, magistrate''s office. Magistrate Elias Vance sits

    of endless bureaucracy. His face shows bone-deep exhaustion - the weariness of
    fighting losing battles against entrenched corruption. As he speaks carefully
    about merchant Silas Croft''s "connections," his expression reveals both frustration
