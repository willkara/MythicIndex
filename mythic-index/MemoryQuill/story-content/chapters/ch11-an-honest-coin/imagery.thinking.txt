I need to create a complete imagery.yaml for chapter 11 "An Honest Coin" based on:

1. The analyst's moment_candidates.yaml with 6 candidate moments
2. The canonical character visual references provided

Let me work through each moment and create production-ready image specifications.

**Chapter Overview:**
- Visual thesis: "From mist-shrouded arrival through shadow-work and flame, ending with the weight of mysterious purpose held in firelight."
- Dominant mood progression: cautious anticipation → tightening net → breathless infiltration → chaotic revelation → contemplative burden
- Color story: silver-gray mist/amber morning → deep shadow/cold steel/fire orange → hearthfire amber/dark metal/pre-dawn gray

**Moment Analysis and Mood Selection:**

1. **Stonebridge Arrival (moment-01)** - Hero shot
   - Emotional color: "cautious anticipation"
   - Setting: Morning mist, city emerging from fog
   - Best mood: **PASTORAL** - soft morning light, diffused atmosphere, hope/anticipation
   - Rationale: After wilderness chapters, this is arrival at civilization - moment of possibility

2. **Magistrate's Office (moment-02)** - Anchor shot
   - Emotional color: "weary desperation"
   - Setting: Cramped office, dusty light, paper chaos

   - Emotional color: "desperate commitment"
   - Setting: Night, glass shattering, dock below
   - Best mood: **KINETIC** - pure action, survival instinct

5. **Bastion Lock (moment-05)** - Symbol shot
   - Emotional color: "ominous significance"
   - Setting: Firelight from burning warehouse, mysterious artifact
   - Best mood: **ETHEREAL** - supernatural recognition moment
   - Rationale: The lock "seeing" Veyra is a mystical/divine moment

6. **Pre-Dawn Contemplation (moment-06)** - Reflection shot
   - Emotional color: "profound introspection"
   - Setting: Quiet room, first light breaking, character in silhouette
   - Best mood: **MEDITATIVE** - deep internal processing, weight of recent events
   - Rationale: Aftermath moment of profound personal transformation

The scene captures a solitary figure wrestling with complex emotions, the soft firelight revealing inner turmoil and quiet resolve. A moment of vulnerability and strength intertwined, where leadership's silent burden becomes tangible.

Veyra Thornwake emerges as a striking presence: her deep earth-brown skin marked by a prominent reddish-brown burn scar, a visual testament to past struggles. Her aesthetic speaks of resilience - a jet black mohawk with shaved sides, one lock braided with brown feathers and turquoise beads, symbolizing a connection to both wildness and tradition. Dark eyes almost black, teal-blue swirling tattoos tracing her neck and left arm, a silver hoop earring adding subtle personal flair.

Her attire tells a story of survival and practicality: layered worn leather with a rigid cuirass over a dark blue tunic, heavy leather bracers providing protection. A thick textured cowl around her neck, a battered rusted metal lantern with a warm golden glow hanging at her belt, accompanied by an array of tokens, tassels, and pouches - each piece a potential narrative of journeys survived.

Thorne Brightward represents a different archetype: a weathered military veteran in his early forties, broad-shouldered and sturdy. His ruddy skin and short steel-gray military crop with a receding hairline speak of years of disciplined service, while his thick, meticulously groomed gray mustache hints at pride and attention to detail.

His armor suggests a seasoned warrior - copper-toned riveted pauldrons protecting muscular shoulders, dark layered leather armor allowing mobility. A massive sledgehammer named "Tremor" hangs at his side, indicating significant martial prowess. His belt is pragmatic, laden with utility - multiple clips, keys, and leather pouches for essential equipment.

The Quartermaster, a rock gnome standing barely over three feet tall, embodies a different kind of expertise. At 47, her weathered appearance reflects years of professional dedication. Auburn hair cropped short, practical and unadorned, frames a face marked by an intriguing scar across her left eyebrow. Her hazel eyes - shifting between green and brown - suggest keen intelligence, while ink-stained fingers reveal her scholarly inclinations.

Her attire speaks of function over form: a worn high-collared leather coat, a segmented leather pauldron bearing a shield emblem. Custom brass spectacles with multiple swing-arm magnifying lenses complete her distinctive professional ensemble.

Magistrate Vance remains an enigmatic figure, his character still in draft stages. The brief textual description hints at profound weariness - a soul "tired in his bones", suggesting repeated struggles against systemic corruption.
