      Veyra stands amid the chaos of the burning warehouse district, but the world has
      narrowed to the object in her hands. The Bastion Lock rests in her scarred palms,
      its dark metal seeming to absorb the firelight rather than reflect it. Her eyes
      are fixed on the lock with an expression of startled recognition—something has
      looked back at her. Behind her, flames lick at warehouse timbers and figures move
      in organized panic, but she is utterly still, caught in a moment of connection
      with something ancient.
