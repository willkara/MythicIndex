After the night at the Wayward Compass, the Company had risen before dawn, leaving the injured merchants in Durja's capable hands. The day-long journey to Stonebridge had been mercifully uneventful, though everyone kept checking their backs, half-expecting Black Hawks or worse to materialize from the morning shadows.

Stonebridge revealed itself gradually through the morning mist as they arrived by early afternoon, first as suggestions of towers against the gray sky, then as solid stone and timber taking shape like a city being born from fog. The bridge that gave the town its name spanned the Silver Rush—five great arches of ancient stonework that had weathered centuries of spring floods and winter ice. The sound of water rushing beneath mixed with the growing noise of commerce: wheels on cobblestones, merchants hawking wares, the ring of hammer on anvil from a dozen smithies.

Despite the season, winter had granted them an unusually warm day, with temperatures mild enough to draw merchants and traders out in numbers typically seen in spring. The balmy air carried none of winter's usual bite, explaining the bustling activity that filled the streets.

"Busy for this early," Grimjaw observed, eyeing the crowds already thick on the bridge. Traders with preserved goods, craftsmen with winter wares, merchants with loaded wagons, travelers of every description. "Mid-winter market day. Weather's warm enough to bring out the traders."

"Good for us," Fayne said, consulting his list again—the thing had become his constant companion. "More merchants mean better selection, maybe better prices if we play them against each other."

"And easier to move unnoticed," Veyra added quietly. Her mind was on Marcus's information, the corrupt merchant Silas Croft. If the intelligence was accurate, they had a decision to make. If it wasn't... well, that was information too.

They made their way across the bridge together, the Company moving with the practiced ease of a unit that had learned to work as one. At the bridge's far end, they paused to assess the city layout and plan their approach.

"The Shepherd's Rest," Thorne said, checking the carved signs at an intersection. "Local guard mentioned it when I was here last year. Clean, quiet, and the owner doesn't ask questions if you don't cause trouble."

The inn was exactly as advertised—unremarkable in every way that mattered. They took a room on the second floor with a view of the street, paying in advance. The innkeeper, a thin man with nervous hands, barely looked at them twice.

Once settled, Veyra spread out a local map of Stonebridge they'd acquired from the innkeeper. "The warehouse district is here, near the docks. If Croft is what Marcus claims, that's where we'll find evidence."

"We should talk to the magistrate first," Thorne suggested. "Get a sense of the official position. If they're already investigating Croft, we don't want to interfere."

Veyra nodded. "Good idea. We'll go together—your reputation opens doors, but I want to hear what he says firsthand." She looked to the others. "While we handle the official channels, you two can work the market. Grimjaw, people trust you. Fayne, you have a good eye for details. See what the merchants are saying about Croft."

"And complete Mistress Elba's list," Fayne added with a grin. "Can't return empty-handed."

"Naturally," Grimjaw said. "But we'll keep our ears open."

They separated at the inn's entrance, each pair moving through the city with purpose. While Grimjaw and Fayne headed toward the bustling market square, Thorne and Veyra made their way to the magistrate's office—a solid stone building that squatted near the town center like a particularly disapproving aunt. The guards at the door recognized the bearing of fellow soldiers and let them pass with minimal questions.

Magistrate Elias Vance was a man who looked tired in his bones, the kind of exhaustion that came from fighting losing battles against entrenched corruption. His office was neat but cramped, scrolls and ledgers competing for space on every surface.

"Captain Brightward," he said, rising as they entered. His eyes moved to Veyra with curiosity. "Your reputation precedes you both. The business at the Wayward Compass has already reached us—the Black Hawks growing bolder, it seems."

"They're always bold when they think no one's watching," Thorne replied, accepting one of the offered seats while Veyra took the other. "We're actually here about a local matter. The grain trade. There've been... irregularities in shipments to Waterdeep."

Vance's expression tightened almost imperceptibly. "Irregularities. Yes. We've noticed them too. Weights that don't match manifests, quality that degrades remarkably between inspection and delivery." He leaned back, studying them both. "You're asking about Silas Croft."

It wasn't a question. Thorne nodded.

"Croft is..." Vance chose his words carefully, "well-connected. He sits on the merchant council, contributes generously to civic works, employs a significant portion of the dockworkers. Accusations have been made before. They tend to... disappear."

Veyra leaned forward slightly. "Disappear how?"

Vance's smile was bitter. "Witnesses develop sudden memory problems. Documents go missing. Accusers find themselves facing counter-suits or mysterious financial troubles."

"But you suspect," Thorne continued.

"I _know_," Vance said with sudden vehemence. "But knowing and proving are different beasts entirely. Croft keeps his true records somewhere secure, and my authority doesn't extend to searching a merchant's private property without cause. Substantial cause."

"And if such cause were to present itself?"

Vance met their eyes steadily. "Then I would act with all the authority at my disposal. Vigorously and immediately."

The message was clear. As they left, a young clerk—barely more than a boy, with ink-stained fingers and an earnest expression—caught Thorne's sleeve.

"Captain," he whispered urgently. "I remember you from the academy. You gave a lecture on tactical integrity. You said the law serves justice, not the other way around."

Thorne waited.

The clerk glanced around nervously, then pressed a rolled parchment into Thorne's hand. "The warehouse registry. Public record, anyone can request it. But most don't know to ask." He fled before Thorne could respond.

While Thorne and Veyra were dealing with official channels, Grimjaw and Fayne dove into the bustling heart of Stonebridge's market square. The unusually warm winter day had indeed brought out merchants in force, their stalls arranged in rough rows between the fountain and the guild halls.

"Right then," Grimjaw said, consulting Fayne's carefully written list. "Mistress Elba wants good salt, better flour, and the best prices we can manage. But she also said to keep our wits about us."

"Salt first," Fayne suggested, eyeing the various stalls. "That Moonshae salt she mentioned won't be easy to find, but maybe someone knows where to get it."

They worked their way through the market methodically, Grimjaw's natural bluntness and Fayne's eye for detail making them effective negotiators. At a spice merchant's stall, run by a weather-beaten woman with knowing eyes, they struck up their first useful conversation.

"Moonshae salt? Aye, I know where to get it," she said, weighing out portions of common salt for their purchase. "But it's dear stuff. Most merchants won't pay the premium. 'Cept for a few who cater to the wealthy." Her voice dropped conspiratorially. "Silas Croft orders it regular-like. Claims his grain buyers expect it for their bread. Strange reasoning, if you ask me."

"Strange how?" Fayne asked casually, counting out coins.

"Well," she leaned closer, "salt's salt for most purposes. But Croft, he's particular about everything. Quality this, premium that. Acts like he's supplying noble houses instead of common granaries."

Grimjaw nodded sagely. "Reputation matters in trade. Man's got to maintain standards."

"Standards," the woman snorted. "More like appearances. My cousin works his docks—says half the shipments that go out don't match what came in. Good grain goes one way, questionable stuff goes another."

They moved on with their salt and several new pieces of information. At a bakery stall, while purchasing flour, they overheard two merchants discussing shipping schedules.

"—told you, don't deal with Croft's warehouses after dark," one was saying. "Too many people coming and going at strange hours. Not natural for a grain merchant."

"Maybe he's expanding," his companion suggested.

"Into what? Midnight baking?" The first merchant shook his head. "Mark my words, there's more than grain moving through those warehouses."

Fayne exchanged a meaningful glance with Grimjaw as they completed their flour purchase. The dwarf suggested they find somewhere to eat and compare notes, leading them to a small tavern on the market's edge called The Grain and Goblet.

Over bowls of hearty stew and warm bread, they pooled their information. Grimjaw attacked his meal with the focused intensity of someone who took eating seriously, while Fayne picked at his more thoughtfully.

"So far we've got premium ingredients going to questionable purposes," Fayne said quietly, "shipments that don't match manifests, and after-hours activity that doesn't fit grain storage."

Grimjaw paused mid-bite, examining his stew with a critical eye. "This is good. Really good. Better than Mistress Elba's winter stew, and I'd never say that to her face."

"High praise," Fayne agreed. "Though I notice you're eating around the mushrooms."

"Mushrooms in stew are different from mushrooms in hash. These are..." He prodded one with his spoon. "Soggy. Water-logged. Cook added them too early, didn't let them give up their moisture first. They're making the whole dish watery."

Fayne blinked. "You can tell that from looking?"

"Lad, I've eaten field cooking for forty years. You learn to identify mistakes by texture alone. Now, if they'd rendered the mushrooms separately first, the let them cool, *then* added them to the stew..." He shook his head. "Would've been perfect. As it is, it's merely adequate."

"You're critiquing the cook's technique."

"Someone should. This is a respectable establishment—they should know better." Grimjaw took another spoonful, chewing thoughtfully. "The meat's good, though. Proper sear before braising. And the bread's fresh, not day-old pretending to be fresh. I'll give them that."

Fayne stared at him. "When did you become a food critic?"

"About the same time Thorne started invading Elba's kitchen. Makes a dwarf think about what he's putting in his mouth." He gestured with his spoon. "Now, about Croft's questionable business practices..."

"And expensive tastes for a man in a supposedly straightforward business," Grimjaw added, tearing off a chunk of bread. "That wine information from yesterday makes more sense now. Marcus has been tracking Croft's habits for a while."

"Question is, what's Marcus's real game?" Fayne mused.

Before Grimjaw could answer, their server—a young man with the calloused hands of a dockworker—lingered at their table.

"Couldn't help overhearing," he said quietly, glancing around. "You're asking about Croft. Word of advice? Be careful who you ask. His people have long ears and longer memories."

"We're just merchants looking for fair dealing," Grimjaw said neutrally.

The young man studied them for a moment, then seemed to make a decision. "If you want to know about unfair dealing, talk to the widows. Three men died on Croft's docks this year. 'Accidents,' they called them. But accidents don't usually happen to men who ask too many questions about weight discrepancies."

He moved away before they could respond, leaving them with more questions and a growing picture of corruption that went deeper than simple grain fraud.

"We should get back," Fayne said, finishing his stew. "Veyra and Thorne need to hear this."

They reconvened at the inn as afternoon was fading to evening, all four members of the team gathering around a table in their room. The information they'd gathered painted an increasingly dark picture.

"The magistrate all but asked us to investigate," Thorne reported, spreading the warehouse registry on the table. "And this indicates Croft's been buying up warehouse space all over the district. More than any grain merchant could need."

"More than grain is definitely involved," Grimjaw said, settling into his chair. "We spent the day talking to merchants and dock workers. The stories all point in the same direction."

Fayne nodded, consulting his notes. "The stories are consistent. Croft buys expensive things—Moonshae salt, fine wines. But his business is common grain. The two don't match."

"Or he's using his legitimate business as cover for something else," Veyra finished. "What else did you hear?"

"Three dock workers died this year," Grimjaw said grimly. "All 'accidents,' all men who'd been asking questions about weight discrepancies in shipments."

"And there's after-hours activity at the warehouses," Fayne added. "Too much traffic for simple grain storage."

Thorne studied the registry more carefully. "Look at these acquisition dates. He's been systematically buying up dock properties for the past two years. That's not expansion—that's preparation for something bigger."

"Unless he's storing more than grain," Veyra said thoughtfully. "Multiple warehouses could mean multiple operations. Real goods in some, doctored goods in others."

"So Marcus was right about Croft being dirty," Fayne concluded.

"About this, at least." Veyra pushed back from the table. "The question is, what do we do about it? And what's Marcus really after in all this?"

"The wine connection suggests Marcus has been here longer than three days," Grimjaw said thoughtfully. "He's been watching Croft, gathering intelligence."

"Or working with him," Thorne pointed out.

"Only one way to find out." Veyra stood. "Tonight, we pay Croft's warehouse a visit."

They gathered in their room as night fell, the sounds of the city muffling their conversation. On the table, Fayne had spread out a detailed sketch of the warehouse district, compiled from the registry information and the intelligence they'd gathered.

"Three entrances," he said, pointing. "Main door, heavily guarded. Loading dock on the river side, locked but only one guard. And here"—he tapped a spot on the roof—"ventilation hatch. Big enough for someone small."

"That would be me," Veyra said. "But I'll need a distraction to get past the roof guards."

"Leave that to us," Grimjaw said. "Thorne and I can stage something at the main entrance. Drunk merchants arguing about a shipment, maybe. Guards love to watch rich folks make fools of themselves."

"While you're providing entertainment," Fayne said, warming to the plan, "I can approach from the river. Not to enter, just to observe. If something goes wrong, I signal."

"What are we looking for exactly?" Thorne asked.

"Records," Veyra said. "Marcus mentioned a secondary ledger. If Croft's been doctoring shipments, he'll have records of the real numbers somewhere. Criminals always do—they can't help but keep track of their cleverness."

"And if we find it?"

"We take it to the magistrate. Let the law handle the rest."

They spent another hour refining details, contingencies, escape routes. It wasn't their usual type of mission, but the principles were the same—get in, achieve the objective, get out without unnecessary complications.

As they prepared to leave, Fayne spoke up. "There's another problem. Getting in is one thing, but that ledger will be locked up. And I doubt Croft leaves keys lying around."

Grimjaw grinned, producing a set of well-worn lockpicks from his belt. "You're not the only one with a checkered past, lad. Before I was a safety inspector, I had to learn how mines were secured. You'd be surprised how similar locks are, whether they're keeping people out of mines or warehouses."

"You're full of surprises," Thorne said.

"We all are," Grimjaw replied. "That's what makes us effective."

The warehouse district at night was a different creature than during the day. Shadows pooled in every corner, and the sound of water lapping at the docks created a constant whisper that masked footsteps. The moon was new, providing perfect darkness for their work.

Veyra crouched on a neighboring rooftop, watching the guards' patterns. They were competent but bored, their circuits predictable. Every quarter hour, they met at the corner to share a smoke and complaints. That would be her window.

Below, she could hear Thorne and Grimjaw approaching, their voices carrying the careful slur of men who'd had just enough to drink to be belligerent but not enough to be dismissed as harmless drunks.

"—told you the shipment was short!" Thorne's voice boomed. "Fifty bushels of wheat, not forty!"

"And I'm telling you, you can't count!" Grimjaw roared back. "It's forty-five, and that's being generous!"

The guards turned to watch, amused. One called out, "Take it somewhere else, gentlemen. This is private property."

"Private? PRIVATE?" Thorne staggered toward them, Grimjaw trying to hold him back in an elaborate pantomime of drunken friendship. "I'll show you private! I've got a contract!"

The guards moved to intercept, leaving their posts. Veyra didn't waste the opportunity. She sprinted across the roof, her soft-soled boots nearly silent on the tiles. The ventilation hatch was where Fayne had marked it, and better yet, the lock was mostly rust. Her knife made quick work of it.

She dropped into darkness, landing on grain sacks that puffed dust into the air. The warehouse was vast, filled with mountains of inventory. But Marcus had been specific—Croft's office was in the northwest corner, second floor.

She moved like a ghost through the maze of crates and barrels, following the wall until she found the stairs. They creaked alarmingly under her weight, but the sound of Thorne and Grimjaw's escalating argument outside covered it.

The office door was locked, naturally. But it was a merchant's lock, meant to deter casual thieves, not professionals. Her professional lockpicks made quick work of it.

Inside, the office was orderly to the point of obsession. Everything in its place, everything labeled. The tapestry Marcus had mentioned was indeed hideous—a glorified representation of some ancient battle rendered in clashing colors.

Behind it, the safe.

This lock was better, more complex. Veyra tried the combination Marcus had provided—third of Mirtul. Nothing. She tried variations, different years, different interpretations. Still nothing.

Outside, the argument was winding down. The guards would return to their posts soon.

She was about to give up when she noticed something—a painting on the desk, partially hidden under invoices. A young woman, pretty in a conventional way, with a brass plate reading "Beloved Mara."

Not his daughter. His mistress.

On instinct, Veyra tried a different date—twentieth of Hammer, the winter solstice, a romantic choice. The lock clicked open.

Inside were gold coins, property deeds, and yes—a black leather ledger filled with neat columns of numbers. Even a quick glance showed the discrepancies. Shipments recorded at one weight, delivered at another, the difference carefully noted with prices and buyers.

She took it, then had a thought. Removing it entirely would alert Croft immediately. Instead, she carefully tore out the most recent pages—enough to prove the crime but not enough to be immediately noticed.

A whistle from outside—Fayne's signal. Time to go.

She relocked the safe, replaced the tapestry, and ghosted back through the office. But as she reached the door, she heard footsteps on the stairs. Heavy ones.

No time for subtlety. She sprinted for the window, shoulder-first through the glass in a shower of shards. The fall was farther than she'd liked, but she hit the dock rolling, coming up running.

Behind her, shouts erupted from the warehouse. Ahead, Fayne had a boat ready, Grimjaw already at the oars.

"Where's Thorne?" she gasped, diving into the boat.

"Leading them on a merry chase," Grimjaw said, pulling hard. "He'll meet us at the inn."

They disappeared into the darkness of the river, leaving chaos in their wake.

Thorne was waiting at the inn, none the worse for wear except for a bruised jaw. "Guard got lucky," he explained. "But I returned the favor."

They examined the ledger pages by candlelight. The evidence was damning—systematic fraud going back years, with coded references to buyers that Fayne recognized as known smuggling operations.

"Look at this," Fayne said, tracing a line with his finger. "Every major weapons shipment has the same notation next to the final payment authorization: 'Per S. Tithe.' What do you suppose that means?"

"A partner's cut," Thorne guessed. "Or a guild tax." Veyra said nothing, filing the detail away. It felt like another piece of a puzzle she couldn't yet see.

"This is enough," Thorne said. "More than enough."

They didn't wait for morning. Veyra and Thorne went directly to the magistrate's house, waking him from sleep. Vance answered the door himself, wrapped in a robe but instantly alert when he saw who it was.

"Inside, quickly," he said, ushering them into his study.

They showed him the ledger pages. His face went through a series of expressions—surprise, satisfaction, then grim determination.

"This is exactly what I needed," he said. "With this, I can get writs for full searches, freeze his assets, bring formal charges." He looked at them sharply. "How did you obtain this?"

"Does it matter?" Veyra asked.

"Legally? No. These records are evidence of crime regardless of how they came to light. But Croft has friends. There might be... complications for you."

"We're leaving at dawn," Thorne said. "Our business here is concluded."

Vance nodded slowly. "Then I never saw you. These documents were delivered anonymously." He stood, suddenly formal. "The city of Stonebridge thanks you for your service, even if it can never acknowledge it."

As they left, the same young clerk from earlier was waiting in the shadows. "The warehouse," he whispered urgently. "There's going to be a fire. Croft's men, destroying evidence. You have to—"

Veyra was already running.

The warehouse district was chaos. Flames leaped from Croft's main building, and bucket brigades were forming. But Veyra could see it was staged—the fire was controlled, concentrated on one section. The office section.

"He's destroying the originals," she said to Thorne as he caught up.

"Let him. We have enough."

But Veyra was watching the patterns, the way Croft's men were moving. They were evacuating certain crates while letting others burn. Whatever was in those saved crates was worth more than grain.

She made a decision. While everyone was focused on the fire, she slipped around to the saved inventory. One crate was already open, its contents visible in the firelight.

Weapons. Good steel, military grade. Enough to arm a small company.

"Smuggling more than grain," Thorne said, appearing beside her.

"The Silent Hand needs weapons for their operations," Veyra said quietly. "Marcus knew. He had to know."

Speaking of Marcus, the man himself materialized from the shadows, looking perfectly composed despite the chaos around them.

"Dramatic evening," he observed. "Though I did warn you Croft was more than he seemed."

"You knew about the weapons."

"I suspected. Confirmation is always valuable." He reached into his coat, producing a scroll. "Your payment, as promised. Supply contracts with three merchant houses, all offering favorable terms to the Last Light Company. Enough to keep you supplied for a year."

"And the gold?"

"Already delivered to your inn. But I have an additional bonus." Another reach into his coat—the man was like a magician's infinite pocket—and he drew out something wrapped in black silk.

Veyra watched the motion with narrowed eyes. "Marcus. How deep *are* your coat pockets?"

"Adequately capacious."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer you're getting." He smiled. "Though I will say that proper tailoring is an investment that pays dividends."

Grimjaw, who had been watching the entire exchange with professional interest, stepped closer. "That coat's got enchantments on it. Has to. Either that or you've somehow violated the basic principles of spatial geometry."

"A gentleman never reveals his tailor's secrets," Marcus replied smoothly.

"I've seen you pull out scrolls, gold, a bottle of wine, lock-picks, and now apparently large metal artifacts," Thorne observed. "That's not tailoring. That's magic."

"Is there a difference when it comes to truly exceptional craftsmanship?"

Fayne had pulled out his journal and was sketching the coat with intense concentration. "The weight distribution doesn't make sense. You should be leaning to one side with all that mass in your pockets, but you're not. Either you're stronger than you look, or—"

"Or I'm just very good at what I do." Marcus produced the wrapped object with a flourish. "Now, if we're quite finished analyzing my wardrobe..."

"Not even close," Grimjaw muttered. "I want to know who makes a coat with infinite pockets. Could use one of those in the forge."

"Sadly," Marcus said with exaggerated regret, "my tailor died years ago. Took his secrets to the grave."

"Convenient," Veyra said drily.

"Isn't it?"

It was a lock. But not just any lock—this was a masterwork of craftsmanship, all dark metal and intricate mechanisms.

"The Bastion Lock," Marcus said. "One of a pair. Whoever holds both the lock and its key controls access to something rather special. An old fortress in the mountains, abandoned for decades but still structurally sound. Perfect for an organization that's outgrown its current accommodations."

"Antique collector?" Grimjaw asked, eyeing the lock's craftsmanship—though his gaze kept drifting back to Marcus's coat with obvious professional envy.

"Among other things," Marcus said easily. "This particular piece came from a Waterdhavian estate sale. Previous owner swore it opened some ancient Netherese fortress called The Bastion. Could be complete rubbish, of course."

"But you're willing to bet on it."

Marcus's smile was pragmatic. "If I'm wrong, I'm out some gold and you get a mountain hike. If I'm right, I have some very useful new associates. Either way, the risk is manageable."

The lock was heavier than expected when Veyra lifted it, its dark metal warm against her palm. For just a moment—less than a heartbeat—she had the strangest sensation of being seen. Not watched, but truly _seen_, as if something had looked directly through her eyes and into her soul.

She blinked, and the feeling was gone, leaving only questions and the weight of well-crafted metal in her hands.

"How old did you say this was?" she asked Marcus, not entirely sure why the question mattered.

"And the key?"

Marcus smiled. "Ah, that's the interesting part. The key is held by someone you'll meet soon enough. Consider this an investment in future cooperation."

Before Veyra could respond, bells began ringing throughout the city. The fire was spreading, or Croft's arrest had begun, or both.

"Time to leave," Marcus said. "We'll meet again, Commander. Count on it."

He vanished into the crowd gathering to fight the fire, leaving Veyra holding the strange lock.

"I still don't trust him," Grimjaw said, appearing with Fayne.

"Neither do I," Veyra replied. "But he delivers results."

"And complications," Thorne added.

"Those too."

The wagons were loaded with supplies, gold was secured in their purses, and they had more questions than answers. Around them, smoke still rose from the warehouse district, and somewhere, Magistrate Vance was likely signing arrest warrants.

It had been, as Marcus might say, a profitable evening. But Veyra couldn't shake the feeling that they'd just become pieces in a game whose rules they didn't fully understand.

And Marcus Heartbridge always collected his debts.

"Time to head back to the inn," Veyra said, pulling her gaze from the still-smoking warehouse. "We should settle our accounts and get some rest before the journey home."

The pre-dawn light was just beginning to bleed over the rooftops as they returned to The Shepherd's Rest, the scent of distant smoke still clinging to their clothes. The inn was quiet, the common room empty save for the innkeeper, who was wiping down tables with a weary air. He looked up as they entered, his eyes lingering on Thorne's bruised jaw before he gave a slight, knowing nod.

"Settling your accounts?" he asked, his voice low.

"And getting a meal before we head out," Thorne confirmed, placing a few silver coins on the counter. "For the room, and for your discretion."

The innkeeper swept the coins into his hand without counting them. "The less I know, the better I sleep," he said, though his gaze flickered with unspoken curiosity. "I'll have the kitchen send up some bread, cheese, and hot cider. On the house. A small price for a quiet night."

Up in their room, they ate in contemplative silence. The adrenaline of the night had faded, leaving behind a thoughtful exhaustion. Grimjaw methodically cleaned his lockpicks, Fayne double-checked the supply contracts Marcus had provided—whistling low under his breath at the favorable terms—and Thorne stared out the window, watching the town slowly come to life.

Veyra sat by the hearth, the strange, heavy lock resting on the table beside her. Its intricate design seemed to absorb the firelight, revealing no secrets. An investment, Marcus had called it. A key to a future they hadn't known they were looking for.

"He played us," Fayne said quietly, breaking the silence. "Gave us a target, pointed us in the right direction, and let us take all the risks while he reaped whatever reward he was truly after." He paused, glancing at the contracts. "Though I'll grant him this—these supply agreements are legitimate. Better than legitimate. The terms are generous enough to keep us equipped for a year, maybe more."

"He also gave us the means to secure a permanent home," Grimjaw countered, tucking his tools away. "This lock, if it's what he claims, could change everything for us. And the gold..." He gestured toward their packs. "Enough to outfit us properly and then some. A fair trade, even if the scales weren't balanced to our liking."

"He knew about the weapons," Veyra stated, her voice flat. "He knew Croft was supplying the Silent Hand, and he let us walk in blind."

"But we walked out with what we needed," Thorne said, turning from the window. "And Marcus delivered on every promise he made. The contracts are solid, the gold is real, and that lock..." He glanced at the Bastion Lock on the table. "If it leads to what he claims, we'll have our permanent headquarters. Yes, his methods are questionable, but his payment isn't." He looked at each of them in turn. "Two days of thorough investigation, and we took a corrupt merchant off the board, secured our own future, and walked away with our skins intact. That's a victory."

A quiet consensus settled over the room. It was a complicated victory, tangled in the schemes of a man they didn't trust, but a victory nonetheless.

They finished their meal, gathered their gear, and loaded the wagons in the inn's courtyard. The supplies they'd purchased, along with the gold from Marcus, filled their transport to capacity. As they mounted up, ready for the day-long journey back to the Westwall Watchpost, Veyra took one last look at the rising sun over Stonebridge.

They had come seeking supplies and had left with a potential destiny. Four days away from their base had brought them more than they'd bargained for—supplies, gold, a mysterious lock, and uncomfortable questions about the allies they were choosing. It was a heavy burden, but one they would carry together.

"Time to go home," she said, and turned the wagon toward the road north.
