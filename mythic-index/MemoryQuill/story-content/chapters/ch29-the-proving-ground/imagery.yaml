      Oil painting, matte finish, visible brushwork, frozen aftermath scene.
      A damaged cargo container now coated in crystalline ice, frozen chemical
      smoke suspended like sculpture in the air. Ice tendrils spread from the
      impact point, coating the ruptured gash in brilliant frost. In the foreground,
      a rock gnome with copper prosthetic arm lowers her hand, arm still glowing
      faintly. Around her, dockworkers and soldiers stare in amazement at the
      transformation from chemical fire hazard to ice sculpture. The danger
      neutralized. Cool blue-white palette, frozen stillness after chaos.

      Extreme close-up of Cid's prosthetic arm at the moment of channeling.
      Articulated brass segments, glowing conduits running between them like

      golden sparks jumping between components. The air around the arm distorts

      Grimjaw's face is split by a booming laugh, his stocky frame shaking with

      patting her like a proud grandfather. Cid looks up at him, covered in grease
      and grime, her face lit with pure delight at his praise. Her prosthetic
      arm still glows faintly with residual magic. Behind them, the rescued
      workers are being tended to. Relief and triumph in the air.
