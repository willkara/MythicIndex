      Medium shot of Aldwin's circular sanctuary. Veyra sits in a worn armchair, tea cup held in both hands, her scarred face softened by the warm lamplight. Across from her, Aldwin the halfling prepares tea with reverent precision. Ceramic jars of dried herbs line the curved walls from floor to ceiling, each meticulously labeled. The low table between them holds a beautiful ceramic tea service. The lamplight catches the steam rising from the cups. Veyra's expression shows a rare moment of peace—the weight of command temporarily lifted.

      Wide action shot of four horses thundering through the Watchpost gates. Vera leads on her mount, hunched forward, leather armor torn and blood-stained. Behind her, Corporal Hayes rides with an arrow shaft protruding from his left shoulder, jaw clenched in pain. Private Mill follows with blood-soaked bandage around his head. Trooper Carrick brings up the rear, slumped forward and clutching his side where blood has soaked through his uniform. Dust rises from the hooves, afternoon light harsh on the scene. The gates frame the desperate arrival.
    composition_notes: |
      Dynamic diagonal composition—horses entering from background right toward foreground left. Vera as lead figure, wounded soldiers staggered behind. Gate arch frames the scene. Motion blur feeling on edges, dust clouds emphasizing speed.

      Extreme close-up of Vera's face in transformation. Her eyes are the focal point—hazel bleeding away to deep corvid black, the pupils invisible, the entire iris becoming a mirror that reflects light in unnatural ways. The transformation is incomplete, creating an unsettling liminality. Her head is tilted at a sharp, bird-like angle. Behind her, slightly out of focus, Echo the raven perches on her shoulder, bright intelligent eyes matching her transformed ones. In the far background, blurred shapes of ravens settling on courtyard walls.

From her human throat emerges a howl that shouldn't be possible, visible as distortion in the air around her mouth. The Company watches in an awed circle behind her.
