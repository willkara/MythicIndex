The circular room breathed with the warmth of a hundred dried herbs, their mingled scents creating an atmosphere of profound calm that seemed to exist outside the concerns of the world. Ceramic jars lined the curved walls from floor to ceiling, each one meticulously labeled in Aldwin's careful script. The soft lamplight caught the warm gleam of his well-used tea service, already prepared on the low table between two comfortable chairs.

Veyra paused in the doorway, as she always did, letting the sanctuary's peace settle around her shoulders like a familiar cloak. This ritual had become as essential as her morning weapons check or her evening patrol rounds—though she'd never admit that to anyone but herself.

"Right on time," Aldwin said without looking up from the delicate ceramic teapot he was warming with practiced motions. "Though you never aren't."

She settled into the chair across from him, noting how her body automatically relaxed into the worn cushions. "Thorne says I'm getting predictable."

"Predictable isn't the word I'd use." Aldwin's hands moved through the familiar ceremony—measuring leaves, testing water temperature, the gentle pour that never splashed or spilled. "Reliable, perhaps. Steady. There's comfort in knowing some things remain constant."

The tea was a blend she couldn't identify, though she'd learned to trust Aldwin's selections. Tonight it carried hints of chamomile and something earthier, grounding. He handed her the cup with both hands, a gesture of respect he'd never explained but she'd come to appreciate.

"How are the preparations going?" he asked, settling back with his own cup.

"We're as ready as we can be." Veyra inhaled the steam, letting it warm her face. "Grimjaw's reinforcements should hold. Vera's got Echo and her ravens watching every approach. The Watchmen know their positions."

"That's not what I meant."

She knew it wasn't. That was the thing about these sessions—Aldwin had a way of asking about the things she didn't want to examine too closely. But somehow, in this herb-scented sanctuary, the examination felt less like surgery and more like gentle healing.

"I've been thinking," she said after a long sip, "about how different this feels from before."

"Before the canyon?"

"Before everything." She turned the cup in her hands, watching the tea swirl. "When it was just me and the Gilded Compass, we were... we were playing at being heroes. Adventure and glory and coin. Even when we took the dangerous jobs, there was something almost..."

"Theoretical?"

"Yes." The word came out with relief. "Like we were actors in a story someone else was telling. But now..." She gestured vaguely toward the walls, indicating the Watchpost beyond. "Now it feels real in a way it never did."

Aldwin nodded, his hazel eyes holding that patient attention she'd learned to value above almost anything else. "What makes it feel more real?"

"The weight." Veyra set down her cup carefully. "Every decision I make, every mission we take, every person who looks to us for help—it all has weight now. Real consequences. When Lysander led us into that canyon, he was risking five lives. When I make choices now..."

"How many lives are you responsible for?"

She was quiet for a long moment, counting. "The core Company. Thorne's patrol. The Watchmen who've thrown in with us. The people in the infirmary. Mistress Elba, Finn, Sarge..." Her voice grew smaller. "Sometimes I feel like I'm carrying the weight of everyone who's ever looked at our lantern symbol and thought 'they'll come for me if I need them.'"

"That's a heavy burden."

"Some days I wonder what Lysander would think of what I've built. Whether he'd recognize the woman who used to follow his orders and crack jokes around the campfire." She picked up her tea again, needing something to do with her hands. "Whether he'd be proud or horrified that his sacrifice led to... this."

Aldwin was quiet for a moment, letting the words settle. When he spoke, his voice carried the gentle authority she'd learned to trust completely. "What do you think he'd say?"

"I think..." She paused, considering. "I think he'd tell me I worry too much about the weight and not enough about the strength."

"Mmm." Aldwin's approving hum was barely audible. "And what strength is that?"

Veyra looked around the room—really looked. At the hundreds of healing herbs, each one carefully chosen and tended. At the worn chair cushions that spoke of countless conversations like this one. At the steady hands that had saved so many lives, including her own sanity in the weeks after the canyon.

"I'm not carrying this weight alone," she said slowly. "Am I?"

"Are you?"

"No." The certainty in her voice surprised her. "Thorne carries the tactical burden. Grimjaw handles the engineering and heavy rescue. Vera tracks our enemies and our lost. You..." She met his eyes. "You tend to our souls."

"And together?"

"Together we're stronger than any of us could be alone." She took a deeper sip of tea, feeling something inside her chest ease. "The Gilded Compass was five people trying to be heroes. The Last Light Company is a family trying to be home for people who need us."

Aldwin smiled, the expression transforming his entire face. "There's a difference?"

"Between heroes and family?" Veyra considered this. "Heroes get to choose their battles. Family fights for each other whether they want to or not."

"And which are you?"

"Both," she said without hesitation. "We choose to fight for people who have no one else. But we also fight for each other because we're home now. This place, these people—even when it's cramped and loud and Grimjaw's snoring keeps the whole building awake—it's home."

"Even when it's under threat?"

Veyra thought about the surveillance they'd discovered, the feeling of being watched and evaluated by unknown enemies. About the Black Hawks' promise of revenge and the Silent Hand's winter timeline that Vera tracked with growing urgency. About all the ways this fragile thing they'd built could be shattered.

"Especially when it's under threat," she said firmly. "That's when home matters most."

Aldwin reached for the teapot, refilling her cup with smooth precision. "You know, when I first met you in Oakhaven, during the plague, I saw someone who was running toward the hardest, most dangerous healing work available. Someone who understood that the greatest mercy sometimes means simply being present in the darkness."

"What do you see now?"

"I see someone who's learned that healing isn't just about the immediate crisis. It's about building something that lasts. Creating sanctuary." He gestured around his herb-filled room. "You've done that, you know. Not just for yourself, but for all of us."

Veyra felt tears prick at her eyes, unexpected but not unwelcome. "Some days I still feel like that woman in the canyon, making impossible choices with no good answers."

"Some days you are that woman. But now she has backup." Aldwin's voice was soft but certain. "Now she has family who'll hold the line while she makes those impossible choices. Who'll share the weight so it doesn't break her."

They sat in comfortable silence, the herb-scented air wrapping around them like an embrace. Outside, Veyra could hear the sounds of the evening watch change—Vera's soft whistle to Echo, Grimjaw's rumbling voice checking the gate mechanisms, Thorne's measured footsteps on his security rounds.

The sounds of family. The sounds of home.

"Thank you," she said finally.

"For the tea?"

"For helping me remember who we are. Who I am." She finished her cup and set it down with finality. "For reminding me that the weight isn't punishment—it's purpose."

Aldwin began clearing the tea service with the same careful attention he brought to everything. "Same time next week?"

"If we're still here."

"We will be." His confidence was absolute. "Whatever comes, we'll be here. Together."

Veyra rose from her chair, feeling lighter than she had in weeks. At the doorway, she paused and looked back. "Aldwin? When this is all over—when we have our permanent headquarters, our real home—will you make sure your sanctuary has the same view?"

"What view is that?"

"The one where I can see all of you. Our family. So I always remember what we're fighting for."

His smile was warm as spring sunshine. "I think that can be arranged."

She nodded once and stepped back into the corridor, carrying the peace of the sanctuary with her like armor against whatever tomorrow might bring. Behind her, she could hear Aldwin beginning to clean and prepare for the next person who might need his particular brand of healing.

The sounds of family. The sounds of home. The sounds worth protecting at any cost.

---

Veyra made her way through the quiet corridors to her own quarters, her footsteps soft on the worn stone. The therapeutic calm still wrapped around her, but as she reached her door, a single tear traced its way down her scarred cheek.

It carried the salt of two different griefs, two different joys. Sorrow for Lysander's easy laughter around the campfire, for Borin's steady wisdom, for Elara's quick wit, for Ignis's wild magic and wilder stories. Friends lost to fire and shadow in a canyon that still haunted her dreams.

But the tear also carried gratitude—for Thorne's unwavering loyalty, for Aldwin's healing hands and gentle questions, for Grimjaw's gruff protectiveness, for Vera's quiet understanding. For all the voices she could hear even now through the walls: the sounds of a family she'd somehow found in the ruins of her first one.

She wiped the tear away and opened her door, carrying both sorrows and joys into the safety of her room. Tomorrow would bring whatever it would bring. Tonight, she would rest in the knowledge that she wasn't carrying the weight alone anymore.

Outside her window, Echo's distant call drifted across the Watchpost—a raven's voice in the darkness, keeping watch over them all.

-->

Veyra woke to the sound of raised voices cutting through the morning air like blade against blade. The peaceful clarity from her session with Aldwin vanished instantly, replaced by the sharp alertness of a commander recognizing trouble.

She threw on her clothes and stepped onto the balcony outside her quarters. The early morning light cast long shadows across the courtyard below, where an unusual scene was unfolding. Ten City Watch soldiers stood in perfect formation near the gate—a mix of spearmen, swordsmen, and archers in their crisp uniforms, their equipment gleaming in the dawn light.

And in the center of the courtyard, voices raised in heated argument, stood Thorne and Lieutenant Tomaq.

"—I understand you have your orders!" Thorne's voice carried clearly, tight with frustration. "But you went around proper channels, Tomaq. We should have been in the loop!"

The massive orc's one good eye never wavered from Thorne's face. "With respect, Sir, I did my duty. Same as I've always done."

"I know your duty is to the Watch," Thorne's voice was tight with frustration. "But you also have obligations to the people serving under your watch. We trusted you!"

"My duty," Tomaq rumbled, his voice carrying the weight of absolute conviction, "is to the City Watch. Has been for fifteen years. You of all people should understand that."

Veyra descended the stairs quickly, her boots silent on the stone. As she drew closer, she could see the tension in every line of Thorne's body—the way his hand rested near his sword hilt, not threatening but ready. The way his shoulders squared like he was preparing for a fight he didn't want.

"I understand chain of command," Thorne replied, his voice still heated. "But reporting our operations without coordination? We trusted you to keep us informed of command's concerns."

"You're right about the coordination, Sir," Tomaq's voice carried regret. "But I gave my word to protect this place. That includes protecting it from threats you might not see coming through normal channels."

"What's going on here?" Veyra's voice cut across the courtyard, not loud but carrying the absolute authority that made both men turn toward her.

Thorne's face was flushed with frustration and disappointment. "Tell her, Tomaq. Tell her about the reports to Commander Atlock that we weren't informed about."

Tomaq straightened, his massive frame managing to look both apologetic and resolute. "Ma'am, I've been keeping my superior informed of potential security threats to a City Watch facility."

"Security threats?" Thorne's voice rose. "We coordinate security with you on everything we do!"

"You're civilians with a charter," Tomaq replied evenly. "Good civilians, effective civilians, but civilians nonetheless. And when civilians operating out of a Watch facility start attracting the attention of hostile mercenary companies..." He gestured toward his soldiers. "Command gets nervous."

Veyra stepped between them, close enough to feel the heat of their anger. "Tomaq. Explain. Now."

The orc's eye flicked to her, and she saw something she hadn't expected—not guilt, but genuine concern. "Ma'am, Commander Atlock asked me to monitor unusual activity around the Watchpost. When your reconnaissance discovered active surveillance, I reported it. When Vera identified acceleration in Silent Hand operations, I reported it. When you began defensive preparations for an imminent attack..." He shrugged his massive shoulders. "I recommended immediate reinforcement."

"You recommended—" Thorne started.

"I told them you were expecting trouble," Tomaq interrupted. "I told them you were good, but that ten mercenaries against an unknown number of Black Hawks was not good odds. I told them that if the Last Light Company fell, they'd lose the best asset they've had in decades."

The words hung in the morning air like smoke from a snuffed candle. Veyra could see the moment Thorne's anger shifted, confusion creeping in around the edges.

"You... you told them we were an asset?"

"You are an asset, Sir," Tomaq said, addressing Thorne directly. "Best thing that's happened to this posting since I got here. But assets need protection, and protection requires communication up the chain." His eye found Veyra's. "I should have coordinated with you both. That failure is on me. But I won't apologize for trying to keep you alive."

Veyra studied the orc's scarred face, reading the truth there—not betrayal, but loyalty expressed through different channels. Loyalty to the Watch, but also loyalty to them. The two hadn't seemed incompatible to him until this moment.

"How long?" she asked quietly.

"Since the Stonebridge mission," Tomaq admitted. "When you started making enemies with real resources. When it became clear you weren't just playing hero anymore—you were building something that mattered."

"And you didn't think we could handle our own problems."

"I thought you could handle most problems," Tomaq corrected. "But when professional mercenaries start conducting weeks of surveillance on a City Watch facility, it stops being just your problem. It becomes mine."

Thorne's hand had moved away from his sword, but his jaw was still tight with frustration. "We had defenses, Tomaq. We coordinated our plans with you."

"You had excellent plans, Sir," the orc acknowledged. "Better than I expected. But plans fail, Captain. People die when plans fail. And I've seen too many good soldiers die because someone was too proud to request backup through proper channels."

Veyra looked at the ten soldiers standing at attention by the gate. Professional, well-equipped, ready to fight and die for people they'd probably never met. She thought about Tomaq's words—not betrayal, but protection. Not spying, but advocacy.

"Commander Atlock," she said slowly. "What does he know about us?"

"Everything I could tell him without compromising operational security," Tomaq replied. "Your capabilities, your methods, your successes. Your value to the city." He paused. "Your growing list of enemies."

"And what does he want?"

"To keep you alive. To keep you effective." Tomaq's eye never left her face. "To make sure that when the real threats come for Waterdeep, the Last Light Company is still there to stand against them."

Thorne was staring at his old friend with a mixture of frustration and dawning understanding. "You could have brought us into the communication loop, Tomaq."

"Could have, Sir," Tomaq agreed. "Should have. But would you have approved the request for reinforcement yourself?"

The question hung between them like a challenge. Veyra could see Thorne wrestling with it, his pride warring with his tactical sense.

"The patrol," Veyra said, nodding toward the soldiers. "How long are they staying?"

"As long as necessary, Ma'am," Tomaq replied. "They're here to assist with defensive operations. Under your command, if you'll have them."

"Under my command?"

"Commander Atlock's orders, Ma'am. You're the ranking specialist for this type of operation."

Veyra felt something shift in her chest—not quite surprise, but recognition. The City Watch wasn't trying to take over. They were trying to help. The distinction mattered more than she'd realized.

She looked at Thorne, saw him processing the same realization. His anger was still there, but it was cooling into something more manageable.

"Next time," she said to Tomaq, "you tell us before you tell them. We're not children who need protection we don't know about."

Tomaq nodded slowly. "Fair enough."

"And Thorne," she turned to her deputy commander. "Next time someone offers us ten extra swords when we're expecting a fight, we say thank you before we say anything else."

Thorne's mouth twitched, caught between annoyance and amusement. "Fair enough."

The tension in the courtyard didn't disappear, but it shifted—from confrontation to cooperation, from betrayal to trust rebuilt. It wasn't perfect, but it was workable.

"All right then," Veyra said, her voice carrying across the courtyard to the waiting soldiers. "Sergeant?"

One of the City Watch soldiers stepped forward with a sharp salute. "Sergeant Kass, ma'am. First Company, Second Regiment. We're at your disposal."

"Good. Lieutenant Tomaq will brief you on our defensive positions. Captain Brightward will coordinate your deployment with our existing forces." She looked between the two men. "Work together. Our enemies won't give us the luxury of fighting amongst ourselves."

Tomaq and Thorne exchanged a look—still wary, but professional. Old soldiers remembering how to soldier together despite their differences.

"Understood," they said, almost in unison.

As the group began to disperse, Veyra caught Tomaq's arm. "Thank you," she said quietly. "For looking out for us, even when we didn't know we needed it."

The orc's scarred face softened almost imperceptibly. "Thank you for not court-martialing me on the spot, Ma'am."

"The day is young," Veyra replied with a ghost of a smile. "Don't push it."

As she walked away, she could hear the sounds of military coordination beginning—Thorne and Tomaq falling into the familiar rhythm of planning defenses, the sergeant briefing his troops, the Company members emerging to assess their unexpected reinforcements.

The peaceful clarity from her session with Aldwin was gone, but something else had taken its place. Not peace, but purpose. Not calm, but readiness.

Whatever was coming, they would face it together. All of them.

-->

The integration had gone smoother than anyone had expected. Sergeant Kass's soldiers had slipped into the Watchpost's rhythms with the efficiency of professionals, taking their positions in the defensive scheme without disrupting the Company's operations. Thorne and Tomaq had found their old partnership again, working together to coordinate patrols and strengthen their defenses.

The ten additional soldiers had made a real difference—not just in numbers, but in confidence. Having trained City Watch archers on the walls and experienced spearmen at the gates gave everyone a sense that they weren't just improvising anymore. They were becoming something more organized, more official.

More real.

Veyra stood on the main parapet, watching the afternoon sun cast long shadows across the courtyard below. Three days of intensive preparation had transformed the Watchpost into something approaching a proper fortress. Grimjaw's engineering improvements, reinforced by the additional manpower, had turned every entrance into a chokepoint and every wall into a firing position.

She was beginning to think they might actually be ready for whatever—

Echo's harsh cry cut across the afternoon air like a blade through silk.

The raven came in fast and low, wings spread wide as she landed hard on the parapet's stone edge. But instead of her usual composed greeting, Echo immediately launched into a series of agitated calls that made Veyra's blood run cold.

Veyra shaded her eyes and looked toward the horizon, following Echo's frantic gaze. There—dust clouds in the distance, riders approaching at a pace that could only mean trouble. Four shapes, pushing their mounts hard across the rolling terrain.

"Incoming riders!" she called down to the courtyard, where the activity suddenly stilled. "Four horses, hard riding!"

The sound of approaching hoofbeats reached them moments later—horses pushed to their limits, their breathing harsh even from a distance. Thorne appeared at Veyra's shoulder, his hand instinctively checking his sword hilt.

"That's fast riding for a routine patrol," he murmured.

As the riders drew closer, Veyra could make out details that made her blood run cold. The lead rider's familiar posture—Vera—but she was hunched forward in her saddle, armor torn and stained. Behind her came three City Watch soldiers, all showing signs of combat.

"Open the gates!" Veyra shouted.

The gates swung wide just as four horses thundered into the courtyard. Vera rode lead on her usual mount, her leather armor torn and dark with what could only be blood. Behind her came three of Sergeant Kass's soldiers, all looking like they'd been through a meat grinder.

Corporal Hayes had an arrow shaft protruding from his left shoulder, the point clearly broken off. Private Mill sported a long gash across his forehead that had bled freely before being hastily bandaged. The third soldier—Trooper Carrick—was slumped forward in his saddle, clutching his side where his uniform was soaked through with blood.

But all four of them were alive, alert, and grimly focused.

Veyra was down the stairs and across the courtyard before the horses had fully stopped. Thorne, Tomaq, and Sergeant Kass converged from their positions, while Aldwin appeared with his healer's kit already in hand.

The moment Aldwin saw the arrow shaft protruding from Hayes's shoulder, Mill's blood-soaked bandage, and Carrick barely staying upright in his saddle, something shifted in his entire demeanor. The gentle halfling healer vanished, replaced by someone Veyra had never seen before.

"This isn't a healing hall anymore," Aldwin said, his voice dropping from its usual gentle tones to something clipped and hard. "Halden! We're setting up field triage. NOW."

Halden appeared from the barracks at a run, his own medical kit in hand. He took one look at Aldwin's face and nodded sharply. "Where do you want the station?"

"Right here. Open courtyard, good light, space to work." Aldwin was already moving, his hands steady and efficient. "I need boiling water, clean cloth, and my emergency kit—the BLACK bag, not the green one. Move!"

"Report while we work," Veyra said, recognizing the shift in Aldwin's demeanor—this was the battlefield medic who'd served in the Border Wars.

Vera slid from her saddle, giving her horse a quick pat before turning to face the assembled command while Aldwin and Halden converged on the wounded. "Contact with enemy scouts, four miles northeast. Four Black Hawks, full reconnaissance gear, mapping our approaches."

"Four?" Thorne asked, watching as Aldwin examined the arrow in Hayes's shoulder with clinical efficiency.

"Were," Vera corrected grimly. "They won't be reporting back."

"Arrow's barbed," Aldwin announced, his fingers probing around the wound with practiced precision. "Halden, I need you to hold him steady. This is going to hurt." He looked at Hayes. "Bite down on this." He handed the soldier a leather strap.

"Begging your pardon, Brother," Corporal Hayes said through gritted teeth, "but this is important. We need to tell them what we saw first."

"The scouts had a base camp," Private Mill added, pressing a fresh cloth to his forehead wound. "Recent use, multiple companies. We got close enough to count the bedrolls."

Veyra felt ice forming in her stomach. "How many?"

Vera and Hayes exchanged a look. "Fifty, minimum," Vera said. "Maybe more. And it wasn't just Black Hawks. I saw gear from at least two other mercenary companies."

"Three companies working together?" Sergeant Kass asked, his professional calm not quite hiding his concern.

"For enough coin, anyone will work together," Tomaq rumbled.

"Timeline?" Veyra asked.

"They were breaking camp when we hit their scouts," Vera reported. "Based on the tracks and the state of their fires, I'd say they're half a day behind us. Maybe less. We passed one of your couriers on the road, riding hard for Eastern Command. Told him about the force we'd spotted, though I doubt he believed the numbers."

"So tomorrow night at the earliest, day after at the latest," Thorne calculated.

"Tomorrow night," Hayes confirmed grimly. "They're not taking their time. This isn't a probing attack—it's a proper assault."

The courtyard had gone very quiet. Even the horses seemed to sense the gravity of the moment. The only sounds were Aldwin's terse commands and Hayes's muffled groans as the arrow was carefully extracted.

"I've got the bleeding controlled," Halden reported, his hands steady as he applied pressure. "Standard field pressure here and here. The head wound on Mill is superficial but needs cleaning, and Carrick's side wound needs immediate attention—looks like a blade got under his mail."

"Triage priority," Aldwin announced, his assessment swift and clinical. "Hayes first—arrow extraction. Carrick second—potential internal bleeding. Mill third—clean and stitch." His hands never stopped moving, packing the arrow wound with something from his emergency kit that made Hayes gasp despite the leather strap. "This will burn, but it'll stop infection. Border Wars special. Saved more lives than prayers ever did."

Veyra looked around at the faces surrounding her—Company members, City Watch veterans, and support staff who'd all become part of something larger than themselves. Fifty professional mercenaries against their current force was long odds, even with all their preparations. Behind her, she could hear Aldwin and Halden working with the efficiency of a practiced team, their medical partnership evident in how few words they needed.

But they'd faced long odds before.

"Sergeant Kass, get word to your remaining patrols—pull them back to defensive positions. No one operates alone anymore."

"Understood."

"Tomaq, what are our options for additional support from the Watch?"

The orc lieutenant considered. "I can send word to Commander Atlock, but any significant reinforcement would take at least one day to organize forces, plus another day for deployment. We're looking at what we have, plus whatever emergency response/com the city can muster."

"Which won't be much on short notice," Thorne added.

Veyra nodded, then turned to Vera. "Time to see how fast your friends can fly."

Vera's expression shifted, becoming something deeper and more focused than her usual alertness. "You want me to send word through the network."

"Two messages," Veyra said. "Official and unofficial. Can you do it?"

"Give me ten minutes to rest the connection, then yes." Vera was already looking around the courtyard, her eyes picking out shapes and shadows that others might miss. "I'll need to do it here in the courtyard. The calling requires open sky for the birds, and I need space to commune with different creature types safely."

She turned toward where Aldwin was still working on the wounded soldiers. "Aldwin, do you have any wildroot or moonleaf in your kit? They help maintain the connection when shifting between multiple forms."

Aldwin looked up from bandaging Carrick's side wound, his eyes sharp with recognition. "Moonleaf, yes. From my personal collection." He nodded to Halden. "Black bag, small blue vial. It's concentrated extract."

As Vera moved toward the center of the courtyard, Echo settled on her shoulder with a soft trill. The raven's bright eyes seemed to hold an understanding that went beyond simple animal intelligence. The Company naturally formed a circle around her, drawn by curiosity and the understanding that they were about to witness something significant.

Behind them, Aldwin was finishing his field surgery, his hands still steady but a slight tremor visible as the battlefield medic persona began to recede. Halden was bandaging Mill's head with practiced efficiency. Both medics paused as Vera moved to the center of the courtyard.

Veyra watched her tracker position herself where everyone could see, yet maintain enough space for what was to come. Fifty mercenaries was a number that demanded every advantage they could find.

It was time to find out if the bonds Vera had been building with the wild things around Waterdeep were strong enough to matter in a real fight.

Vera settled cross-legged on the courtyard stones, Echo perched on her shoulder. The Company formed a natural circle around her, close enough to witness but far enough to give her space. Even the wounded soldiers propped themselves up to watch.

She closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, they weren't quite human anymore.

The first call went out through Echo's voice—a series of harsh cries that seemed to echo across the late afternoon sky. But as the sound emerged, Vera's eyes shifted from their normal hazel to something else entirely—deep, corvid black that reflected the light in ways human eyes never could.

Within moments, answering calls began to drift back from the distance. Ravens, crows, even a few hawks drawn by the urgency in Echo's tone. They came in small groups and pairs, settling on the courtyard walls and nearby rooftops. Black wings and bright eyes, all focused on the half-elf whose form was beginning to blur at the edges.

Vera's voice shifted, taking on the clicking, cawing cadences of the corvid tongue. But it was more than just her voice changing. Her head began to move in sharp, jerking motions—unmistakably bird-like. Her fingers, still folded in her lap, seemed to elongate, the bones visible beneath the skin resembling the delicate structure of wings. When she gestured, her shadow on the courtyard stones showed wings spreading wide, despite her having none.

"Stone's blood," Grimjaw breathed. "Seen druids in the mountain holds, but never with this kind of reach."

The assembled Company watched in awed fascination as Vera's form shifted and flowed between aspects. They'd all heard of druidic shapeshifting, but witnessing it was something else entirely. The City Watch soldiers had seen woodland magic before, but nothing on this scale.

The message was complex: danger approaching, need for swift messengers, calls for aid from both human and non-human allies. Some of the ravens would fly to Waterdeep, carrying word to specific Watch stations and guild contacts that might respond quickly. Others would spread word through the broader corvid network, reaching communities and groups that existed outside official channels.

But the birds were just the beginning.

Vera's voice changed again, dropping into lower, more rumbling tones. A call that seemed to resonate through the ground itself rather than the air. As it did, her entire posture shifted. She dropped forward onto all fours for a heartbeat, her back arching in a way that was distinctly not human. When she raised her head, her nose twitched, processing scents that no human could detect.

Within minutes, the first of the ground-dwellers began to appear.

Squirrels emerged from their trees, their normally skittish behavior replaced by alert attention. Rabbits crept from the underbrush, their large eyes focused on the half-elf whose movements had become quick and darting, freezing into perfect stillness before exploding into motion again—prey behavior written into every gesture.

Several City Watch soldiers took involuntary steps backward as Vera's face seemed to shimmer. For just a moment, whiskers appeared to sprout from her cheeks, and her ears—had they moved? Had they grown longer? The transformation was fluid, never quite settling on one form.

Even a few of the Watchpost's semi-feral cats appeared, drawn by something in Vera's voice that transcended species boundaries. When she looked at them, her pupils had become vertical slits.

"Easy," Thorne murmured to his soldiers, recognizing their unease. "Druidic magic, but on a scale most of us have never seen. She's coordinating multiple networks at once."

To each group, Vera delivered a different message. The squirrels would spread word through the forest network, reaching creatures that lived deep in the woods around Waterdeep. The rabbits would carry warnings to their burrows, ensuring that any forest folk who might aid them would know help was needed.

Aldwin, still kneeling beside his patients, had stopped his work entirely. His eyes were wide with recognition. "Primal magic," he whispered. "The old connection. I've read about it, but to see it..."

But it was the final call that would truly test her abilities.

Vera's voice dropped to a deep, rumbling growl that seemed to resonate from somewhere deeper than her throat. As she made the call, her entire bearing shifted. She dropped into a crouch that was distinctly predatory, weight balanced on the balls of her feet in a way that spoke of spring-loaded power.

Her eyes were the first thing to change—hazel bleeding away to amber that caught the light like molten gold. When she tilted her head to listen for responses, the movement was sharp and precise, unmistakably wolf-like. Her nostrils flared as she processed scents that no human could detect, and her breathing shifted to shorter, more efficient patterns.

Gray-silver patches began to appear along her arms and the back of her neck—not a full coat, but clear evidence of the transformation trying to push through. Her fingernails darkened and grew slightly pointed, and when she moved, it was with an inhuman fluidity that spoke of muscles learning different patterns.

The most unnerving change was in her face. Her features didn't reshape completely, but they sharpened. Her ears seemed slightly more pointed, her canine teeth more prominent when she spoke, and her jaw stronger. When she looked at the assembled watchers, there was intelligence there—but it was intelligence filtered through primal instincts.

From her human throat came a howl that no human vocal cords should have been able to produce. It was deep, carrying, and undeniably the voice of a pack leader calling to her own. The sound seemed to hang in the air longer than physics should have allowed, and it carried across the countryside with unnatural power.

The response was immediate and overwhelming. Howls erupted from the forest in a chorus that spoke of pack allegiance and territorial defense. Not just one or two voices, but dozens, creating a symphony of wild loyalty that made the very stones of the Watchpost seem to thrum with primal energy.

"That's not normal druidic work," Grimjaw said quietly, his voice carrying professional appreciation. "Seen plenty of woodland magic in the mountain holds, but she's... she's bridging forms without fully committing to either. That takes considerable skill."

The City Watch soldiers watched with respectful attention. They'd served alongside druids before and recognized advanced shapeshifting techniques, though few had seen someone maintain human form while channeling lupine abilities so completely.

"Partial transformation magic," Aldwin observed, his voice thoughtful rather than worried. "Incredibly difficult to master, but it allows her to maintain human tactical thinking while accessing enhanced senses and communication. Impressive work."

Echo launched herself into the air, flying toward the forest to carry additional messages to the pack leaders directly. When she returned minutes later, Vera was slowly settling back into fully human posture, though her eyes retained their amber color for several heartbeats longer.

She remained crouched for a moment, breathing deeply as the enhanced senses gradually faded. When she lifted her head, a thin trickle of blood ran from her nose—the telltale sign of magical strain. When she stood, she moved with obvious effort, and Veyra could see the toll the partial transformation had taken—sweat beaded on her forehead, and her hands trembled slightly as she steadied herself against the courtyard wall.

"The pack leaders will meet me at moonrise," Vera said, her voice carrying a slight rasp that hadn't been there before. "Three miles out, by the old stone bridge. If I can make them understand what's at stake..." She paused, one hand unconsciously touching her chest as if feeling for something that wasn't there. "I have to survive this. Someone out there is still looking for me—has been for seven years. I won't let the Silent Hand take that away too."

"What are you asking them to do?" Veyra asked, her voice carefully steady.

"What they've always done," Vera replied, her voice finally, fully human again. "Protect their territory from invaders."

The last of the messenger animals began to disperse, carrying their various warnings into the growing dusk. Ravens took flight toward the city, their black forms disappearing into the distance. Smaller creatures melted back into the shadows, carrying word through networks that existed entirely outside human awareness.

As the courtyard slowly returned to normal, Vera stood, brushing dirt from her leathers. Her movements were still slightly off, as if she was remembering how to be human again. "The messages are sent. Now we wait to see who answers."

The Company members stood in respectful silence for a moment longer, processing the skill of what they'd witnessed. Then Grimjaw broke the silence with a low whistle of professional appreciation. "By the stone, lass. That partial shifting while maintaining human thought... I've never seen anything like it. Most druids go full animal or stay full human."

Vera wiped the blood from her nose with the back of her hand, still catching her breath from the effort. "Don't be too impressed. It's all self-taught, rough around the edges." She stretched her shoulders, working out the tension from holding the partial form, then had to steady herself for a moment as dizziness washed over her. "Years of tracking my brother led me deeper into wild magic than any Circle would recommend. I learned through desperation, not proper training."

Private Mill, his head still bandaged, spoke up from where he sat. "Self-taught? That's... that's incredibly dangerous. The druids I served with always said—"

"I know," Vera interrupted quietly. "I know the risks. I've nearly killed myself more than once pushing boundaries I probably shouldn't cross. But I needed every advantage I could get." Her voice carried the weight of years of desperate searching. "A proper druid master would probably be horrified at my technique, but it's kept me alive and helped me track where others couldn't."

Tomaq nodded with new understanding. "That explains the... complexity of it. Circle druids usually focus on complete transformations. Holding that middle ground between human and wolf—that takes serious discipline and control."

"Control is generous," Vera admitted with a tired smile, accepting a water skin that Thorne quietly offered. She took a long drink before continuing. "It's more like... directed desperation. That's what happens when you learn magic through necessity instead of training. Different techniques, maybe more flexible, but definitely more dangerous." She rolled her shoulders again, still working out the tension. "Once we find my brother and deal with the Silent Hand, I should probably seek out a proper Circle. Learn to do this safely."

The respectful distance the others maintained now carried a different quality—not just recognition of her power, but awareness of the years of determined study it had taken to master such unorthodox magic alone.

Aldwin returned to his patients, his hands steady but his expression thoughtful. "Fascinating technique," he murmured to Halden as they worked. "I've read about partial transformations in the old texts, but to see it performed..." He shook his head in professional admiration.

As people began to move again, resuming their preparations, Veyra caught Vera's arm gently. The tracker looked at her with eyes that were human but held depths that hadn't been there before.

"That was..." Veyra searched for words.

"Necessary," Vera finished quietly. "They needed to see. To understand that we're not alone in this fight. That nature itself stands with us."

Veyra nodded, but her attention was caught by something else—a pair of yellow eyes watching them from the forest edge, just visible in the gathering shadows. As she watched, the eyes blinked once, slowly, then disappeared.

"Tomorrow night," she said quietly.

"Tomorrow night," Vera agreed. "But they won't be facing just us anymore."

The sound of howling drifted across the evening air once more, and this time there were more voices joining the chorus. Many more.

Whatever was coming for the Last Light Company, it would find them ready. And they wouldn't be alone.
