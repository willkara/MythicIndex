          Pre-dawn stillness in the mezzanine quarters. Veyra's small room lit
          only by her eternal lantern—the flame steady against the darkness.
          Grimjaw's corner study cluttered with crumpled papers and
          failed attempts at academic phrasing. The personal spaces speak to
          character: Veyra's minimalist dedication, Grimjaw's practical struggle

          Morning light streaming through warehouse windows illuminates the
          long tables where the Company gathers. The space transforms from
          utilitarian dining to family warmth as Thorne serves breakfast in

          Pre-dawn kitchen with oil lamp warmth pushing back shadows. The
          space where Thorne and Elba negotiated territorial rights—his

          cooked, apron properly worn, care properly expressed.

          Morning markets awakening—vendors setting up stalls, early shoppers,
          children playing between displays. The Company's passage draws
          recognition: sweet rolls pressed into hands, craftsmen offering
          gifts, children asking wide-eyed questions about heroes. The city
          knows them now, and this walk becomes a processional of community
          appreciation before Grimjaw's academic trial.

          Gleaming marble halls catching morning sunlight—brilliant, almost
          intimidating sheets of reflected light. Three hundred seats filled
          with scholars, faculty, visiting dignitaries. The architecture
          declares intellectual ambition while the Company's weathered gear
          marks them as distinctly non-academic. This is where practical
          knowledge meets theoretical pursuit, where Grimjaw's scars speak
          louder than any mathematical proof.

      Captain Thorne Brightward stands at a long wooden serving table in the
      mess hall, wearing a cream-colored apron with small embroidered roses
      along the trim. His sleeves are rolled to the elbow, wooden spoon held
      with the same precision he'd use for a sword. Before him, geometrically
      perfect portions of Captain's Hash steam in serving dishes—golden potatoes,
      crisp bacon, folded eggs. Morning light streams through high warehouse
      windows, catching the steam. Behind him, Company members freeze in
      various states of disbelief and amusement. Veyra's slight smile visible.
      Thorne's expression: calm, dignified, completely unembarrassed.

      Finn sets a steaming mug of tea beside Grimjaw's scattered papers,
      his earnest face delivering simple truth. The desk is surrounded by
      crumpled attempts at academic phrasing. Grimjaw looks up from his
      failure, expression shifting as Finn's words land—'You're honest about
      what you don't know.' Morning light just beginning to creep through
      the window. The moment captures wisdom flowing in an unexpected direction.
