The warehouse complex stood silent in the pre-dawn darkness, most of its inhabitants still lost in sleep. Only the harbor watch bells and distant clatter of early merchant carts broke the quiet. Captain Thorne Brightward moved through the shadows with practiced stealth, his bare feet making no sound on the cold wooden floors of the main warehouse.

He'd been awake for an hour, mind too active for rest. Tomorrow—today, rather—Grimjaw would address the most prestigious academic minds in Waterdeep. The dwarf had saved seven lives through sheer expertise, and now the city's scholars wanted to understand how. But more than that, Thorne simply wanted to make breakfast for his family. There was something about the early morning quiet, the promise of a warm meal, the simple act of care that had always appealed to him. Field cooking had been one of the few pleasures during long campaigns.

The Mess area lay in darkness, but Thorne navigated it from memory. Six weeks of living here had taught him the layout—where Mistress Elba stored the good flour in the kitchen corner, which cupboard held the preserves, how to work the finicky latch on the spice cabinet. He struck flint and lit a small oil lamp, the warm glow pushing back the shadows in the expanded kitchen area.

"Right then," he murmured, rolling up his sleeves and examining the available ingredients with a practiced eye. "A proper field breakfast. Haven't made one of these in months."

He moved with quiet efficiency, selecting potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, bacon, and eggs with the confidence of someone who had fed dozens of hungry soldiers on questionable provisions. His knife work was clean and economical—uniform dice on the potatoes, precise strips of onion, carrots cut into small rounds. Years of campaign cooking had taught him the importance of consistency and timing.

The bacon went into the cold pan first, a technique learned from a grizzled quartermaster during the Border Wars. As it began to render, he prepared his other ingredients with military precision, each component ready for its proper moment in the sequence.

"Captain Brightward." The voice was low, dangerous, and entirely too calm for comfort. "What in the nine hells are you doing in my kitchen?"

Thorne turned slowly to find Mistress Elba silhouetted in the doorway leading from the main warehouse, a meat cleaver gleaming in her right hand. Even at barely four feet tall, she filled the doorway with her presence. Her iron-gray hair hung loose around her shoulders, unbraided from its usual practical style and sleep-tousled. Her nightgown was practical flannel rather than frilly lace, but she looked no less formidable for being roused from sleep—if anything, more so, with the natural intimidation that came from waking a dwarf before dawn.

"Mistress Elba." Thorne continued stirring the bacon without missing a beat. "Making breakfast. Should be ready in about twenty minutes."

"Were you indeed." She stepped into the kitchen area proper, and Thorne caught the way her eyes assessed his technique—the even browning of the bacon, the precisely diced vegetables waiting in neat piles, the controlled heat under the pan. "At five-thirty in the morning. In my kitchen. Without permission."

"Early start makes for a good day. And I know what I'm about."

Elba set the cleaver on the counter with deliberate precision, but her eyes remained fixed on his cooking. "Captain, I've been running kitchens since before you learned to hold a sword. This"—she gestured broadly at the organized chaos around them—"has a system. A delicate, precise system that keeps thirty people fed without poisoning anyone. Stone's teeth, do you have any idea what chaos looks like when it happens to breakfast?"

"I can see that," Thorne replied, adding the potatoes to the rendered bacon fat with practiced timing. "Very efficient setup. Reminds me of the quartermaster's field kitchen at Dragonspear. Everything in its place, everything for a purpose."

Despite herself, Elba found her attention drawn to his technique. The potatoes hit the fat with a satisfying sizzle, and he immediately adjusted the heat with the confident touch of someone who understood temperature control. "You actually know what you're doing," she said, sounding almost accusatory.

"Ten years as an officer, Mistress Elba. You learn to cook when the quartermaster's drunk, the supply train's late, and fifty men are looking at you to solve the problem of empty bellies." He tested a potato with his knife tip. "This is just scaled down from feeding a company to feeding a Company."

Elba moved closer, watching as he added the onions at precisely the right moment—when the potatoes had developed a golden crust but weren't yet fully cooked through. "The timing's right," she admitted grudgingly. "Most people would have thrown everything in at once and made slop."

"Slop doesn't win battles. Or build morale." Thorne glanced at her. "Why are you up? Usually takes a small earthquake to wake kitchen staff before dawn."

"Heard someone moving around my domain. Thought it might be raiders. Or worse—Grimjaw trying to make his own breakfast again." She shuddered at the memory, adjusting her nightgown. "By my grandmother's rolling pin, last time he nearly burned down the Westwall Watchpost trying to boil water. And that one calls himself a dwarf!"

Thorne chuckled, cracking eggs into a bowl with one-handed efficiency. "Field breakfast isn't complete without properly folded eggs. The trick is getting them just set but still creamy."

"I know how to cook eggs, Captain," Elba said tartly, but she was watching his preparation with professional interest.

"Different techniques, I'm sure. This is quartermaster style—designed to feed a lot of people quickly while still being actually edible." He poured the eggs into the pan, where they immediately began to set around the vegetables. "The secret is not overthinking it. Simple ingredients, proper timing, a bit of care."

As he gently folded the eggs through the hash, he frowned slightly. "Though I was never able to get the mushrooms quite right. Always seem to either turn to mush or stay too firm. Field conditions aren't ideal for delicate work."

Elba stepped closer, examining the mushrooms with a critical eye. "You're adding them too late. Mushrooms need to give up their water first, or they'll make everything soggy." She reached past him to adjust the heat. "And too high a temperature. They need gentle persuasion, not bullying."

"Ah." Thorne watched as she demonstrated the proper technique, stirring the mushrooms separately until they released their moisture and began to brown properly. "That explains the disappointment over the years."

"Basic technique, child," Elba said, but there was approval in her voice as she guided his hands to the proper stirring motion with stubborn insistence. "Most people try to rush them. Mushrooms have their own timing, just like everything else in life. You can't bully them into cooperation."

As he gently folded the properly cooked mushrooms and eggs through the hash, Elba found herself nodding approval despite her territorial instincts. "The heat control is good. And your timing..." She paused, clearly reluctant to offer praise. "It's adequate. For field cooking."

"From you, that's practically a military commendation."

"Don't let it go to your head." But there was a hint of warmth in her voice now. "Why, though? Why get up before dawn to make breakfast for people who would happily eat cold rations if necessary?"

Thorne considered the question as he adjusted the seasoning, tasting and correcting with the confidence of experience. "Because they don't have to. Because Grimjaw's nervous about today and deserves something better than worry on an empty stomach. Because Veyra carries enough weight without adding hunger to it." He met Elba's eyes. "Because I like making breakfast. Always have. There's something satisfying about starting the day by taking care of people."

Elba studied his face, seeing the genuine contentment there as he worked. Her amber eyes softened slightly, though her voice remained firm. "Well then, child," she said finally, crossing her arms, "next time you want to take care of people in my kitchen, you ask first. System, Captain. Everything in its proper order. I don't care if you commanded half the Sword Coast—this is my domain."

"Understood. Though you have to admit, the results aren't terrible."

She examined the hash with a critical eye—golden-brown potatoes, perfectly cooked onions, eggs set but still creamy, bacon crisp but not burned. The proportions were exact, the cooking even, the presentation simple but appealing. "It's... adequate," she repeated. "For field cooking."

Coming from her, Thorne knew that was high praise indeed.

"Besides," Elba added with a slight smile, "if you're going to invade my kitchen at ungodly hours, at least you didn't make a mess doing it."

Thorne looked around to find that he had indeed worked cleanly, washing utensils as he went and keeping his workspace organized. Old habits from cooking under hostile conditions, where attracting scavengers or leaving evidence could be dangerous.

"Military discipline has its advantages," he said simply.

"Hmph. Still should have asked first, lad," she muttered, but there was no real annoyance in it now—just the stubborn pride of a dwarf protecting her territory.

As the warehouse complex began to stir, its inhabitants emerged for their morning routines with the comfortable rhythm of a well-established community. Veyra was always first, rising before dawn in her mezzanine level quarters to tend to her lantern and prepare for the day ahead. She sat cross-legged on her narrow cot, the eternal flame dancing between her cupped palms.

The lantern had burned for four months now without pause, its light steady and warm against the pre-dawn chill. Veyra performed her daily ritual with quiet reverence—checking the glass for cracks, cleaning the metal housing, ensuring the flame had sufficient oil to burn. The light had become more than a tool or memorial; it was her anchor, her constant companion, the physical reminder of her vow. As she reviewed the day's planned activities, she unconsciously shifted the lantern toward her notes about Grimjaw's lecture preparation—and felt the familiar warmth that told her their plans were sound, their priorities correct.

Her fingers moved to the small jar of salve on her nightstand, a mixture of herbs and oils that Aldwin had prepared specifically for scar tissue. She applied it carefully to the starburst pattern on her left cheek, working the ointment into the raised flesh with patient, circular motions. The scars ached sometimes, especially before storms, but they were part of her now. Part of her story, her strength, her purpose.

In the small mirror propped against her lantern's base, she caught her reflection—scarred, marked, but undeniably alive. The face that looked back at her was harder than it had been in Undershade Canyon, weathered by responsibility and loss, but there was something new there too. Peace, perhaps. Or at least acceptance.

Three rooms down along the mezzanine level, Aldwin Gentleheart conducted his own morning ceremony. His quarters were spartan but organized, with shelves lined with precisely labeled jars of herbs and teas. He moved among them with the deliberate care of a master craftsman, selecting ingredients for the day ahead.

Today required special consideration. Grimjaw would face an audience of scholars and dignitaries, minds trained to dissect and analyze every word. The dwarf would need calm, clarity, and confidence—qualities that could be supported, if not created, through careful preparation.

Aldwin chose chamomile for steadiness, ginger for clarity of thought, a touch of mint for freshness, and just a hint of valerian to ease nervous tension without dulling the mind. He ground the herbs by hand, breathing in their combined fragrance, letting his own anxiety settle as he worked.

"Steady, old friend," he murmured to himself, using the same tone he'd employ to calm a frightened patient. "This is just another form of healing. The dwarf has the knowledge; we simply help him share it."

In the corner room on the mezzanine level that served as his temporary study, Grimjaw Ironbeard sat hunched over a small desk, surrounded by crumpled sheets of parchment. Before him lay his current attempt at preparing lecture notes, the page covered with crossed-out lines and marginally legible corrections.

"Fundamental Principles of—" No, too pompous.
"The Art and Science of—" Worse.
"Practical Applications in—" By his beard, it sounded like a manual.

He crumpled the page and tossed it toward the growing pile in the corner. Fifty years of experience, and he couldn't find the words to explain it to a room full of scholarly minds. How did you describe the feel of stone under stress? The way a building's structure spoke to those who knew how to listen? The delicate balance between supporting weight and allowing movement?

"How Not to Die in a Collapse," he wrote finally, then stared at the words. Blunt, direct, honest. It would have to do.

A soft knock interrupted his brooding. "Master Ironbeard?" Finn's voice carried through the door. "Are you awake?"

"Aye, lad. Come in."

Finn entered carrying a steaming mug of what smelled like strong tea. The young man had grown considerably since joining the Company—his shoulders broader, his manner more confident, but his face still held the earnest enthusiasm that made him so easy to like.

"Thought you might need this," Finn said, setting the mug beside the scattered papers. "Couldn't sleep either?"

Grimjaw grunted, accepting the tea gratefully. "Lot of minds in that hall today. Important ones. What if they ask questions I can't answer?"

"Then you'll tell them you don't know," Finn said simply. "That's what makes you different from them, isn't it? You're honest about what you don't know."

The dwarf considered this, sipping his tea. "Most academics, they've got theories. I've got scars."

"Scars tell better stories than theories, I think. At least yours do." Finn gestured at the crumpled papers. "What are you trying to write?"

"Something that makes sense to people who think in formulas instead of feelings."

"Why not just be yourself? Tell them what you told me about reading stone, about listening to buildings, about knowing when to trust your instincts over your calculations?"

Grimjaw looked down at his latest attempt—"How Not to Die in a Collapse"—and found himself almost smiling. "Straight talk?"

"The straightest. You saved seven lives by being exactly who you are. Why try to be someone else now?"

As the warehouse complex continued to wake around them, each member of the Company prepared for the day in their own way. Marcus emerged from his mezzanine level quarters looking impeccable despite the early hour, his clothes pressed and his hair perfectly styled. Fayne checked and rechecked the duty roster in her quarters, ensuring every detail was accounted for. The younger members of the team moved through their morning training routines with increasing skill and confidence.

But it was the quiet moments that mattered most—Veyra's careful tending of her memorial flame, Aldwin's thoughtful selection of healing herbs, Grimjaw's honest struggle with academic expectations, and Finn's simple wisdom offered without pretense.

They were more than a rescue company now. They were a family, bound together by shared purpose and mutual care. And today, they would support one of their own as he shared his gifts with the world.

The Mess began to fill as the Company gathered for the morning meal, drawn by the unusual sounds and smells emanating from the kitchen area. Conversations paused as they took in an unprecedented sight: Captain Thorne Brightward standing at the serving table, wearing what appeared to be Mistress Elba's second-best apron—complete with small embroidered roses along the trim—and wielding a wooden spoon with military precision.

"Is that..." Veyra began, then stopped, tilting her head as if she might be hallucinating.

"Our esteemed deputy commander," Marcus confirmed with obvious amusement, "apparently practicing the domestic arts."

The moment was interrupted by Kelen's voice from the main warehouse entrance. "By Tyr's hammer, is that Captain's Hash?" The sergeant entered with obvious excitement, followed closely by Darric and Venn, all three showing the same sudden alertness of soldiers who'd recognized something significant.

"Haven't had proper Captain's Hash since the Trollbark Campaign," Darric added, practically pushing past the others to get a better look. "Captain, you're still making it!"

Venn was staring with undisguised glee at Thorne's attire. "Captain... are those roses on your apron?"

Thorne looked down at the floral trim with the dignity of a man who had commanded troops under fire. "Mistress Elba's kitchen, Mistress Elba's rules. The apron was a condition of access."

"A pink apron," Venn continued, barely containing his mirth.

"Rose-colored," Thorne corrected firmly. "And it's practical."

"Captain," Kelen said, already moving toward the serving dishes with the focused determination of a man on a mission, "please tell me you finally figured out the mushroom situation."

"Mistress Elba provided instruction on proper technique," Thorne replied with just a hint of pride.

The three patrol members exchanged knowing looks. "Remember the Westford March?" Darric asked his companions. "When the Captain tried to cook mushrooms in the rain?"

"Turned them into gray soup," Venn added with a grin. "Tasted like wet leather."

"I was working with suboptimal conditions," Thorne protested.

"You were working with mushrooms and hubris," Kelen corrected, grinning. "We tried to tell you—"

"The apron though," Venn interrupted, returning to his favorite topic with the dedication of a terrier with a bone. "Captain, I have to ask—does it come in different colors? Because I'm thinking if you're going to commit to the domestic arts, you should have options. Maybe a nice lavender for spring?"

"The apron is functional," Thorne said with the patience of a man who had commanded troops through worse provocations.

"Functional *and* fashionable," Darric agreed with entirely too much enthusiasm. "The roses really bring out the... what would you say, Kelen? The warmth in his eyes?"

"I'd say they complement his leadership style," Kelen replied, not missing a beat. "Tough exterior, hidden depths of floral appreciation."

Marcus, who had been observing the exchange with obvious amusement, leaned forward. "I know an excellent tailor who could create a whole wardrobe of aprons. Different designs for different occasions. Perhaps a more martial pattern for combat training days?"

"Or little swords instead of roses!" Venn suggested brightly. "That would maintain dignity while honoring your commitment to proper kitchen protocol!"

Veyra, watching this descent into collective mockery, caught Thorne's eye and gave him the smallest of sympathetic nods. He acknowledged it with a slight straightening of his shoulders and turned back to his tormentors with military composure.

"Gentlemen," he said calmly, "I'm wearing this apron because Mistress Elba has standards for her kitchen. When you've earned the right to use that kitchen, you can negotiate your own terms with her. Until then, I suggest you focus on appreciating the breakfast rather than critiquing the cook's wardrobe."

"But the roses—" Venn began.

"Are well-embroidered and demonstrate Mistress Elba's needle-work skills," Thorne finished firmly. "Which is more than any of you could say about your own decorative abilities."

The rebuke was delivered with such calm authority that even Venn subsided, though the grin remained fixed on his face.

Mistress Elba, who had been listening from the kitchen area, called out with obvious satisfaction, "Well said, child! The lad has taste, which is more than I can say for the rest of you lot!"

Thorne looked up from plating his creation, his face slightly flushed from kitchen heat and perhaps embarrassment, but his dignity intact despite the rose-embroidered apron. "Military hash," he announced formally to the gathering crowd. "Prepared according to field regulations with... local improvements."

He gestured to the serving dishes, where his handiwork was displayed with geometric perfection. Each portion was identical—precise cubes of golden potato, evenly distributed bits of bacon, eggs folded with mathematical accuracy. It looked exactly like what it was: a soldier's breakfast executed with newfound culinary technique.

Mistress Elba emerged from the kitchen area proper, her stout frame still wrapped in her practical night robe but carrying herself with the dignity of a dwarven master presenting her protégé's work. Her hair was now properly braided, and her amber eyes held a grudging approval. "Captain Brightward has been receiving instruction in proper kitchen procedures," she announced, crossing her arms. "He shows adequate potential for someone who normally subsists on hardtack and questionable jerky. Child actually listened when I corrected his mushroom technique."

The gathered Company exchanged glances, uncertain whether to be impressed or concerned, but the patrol members needed no convincing. Kelen, Darric, and Venn had already secured plates and were sampling the hash with the appreciation of men who knew exactly what they were tasting.

"That's the proper technique right there," Kelen announced after his first bite, gesturing with his fork. "Perfect potato texture, bacon rendered just right, and the mushrooms..." He paused for dramatic effect. "Actually edible."

"It's been months since we had real Captain's Hash," Darric explained to the watching specialists. "You don't understand—this isn't just breakfast. This is art. Military art."

Grimjaw stepped forward, accepting a plate with the grave solemnity due a formal diplomatic exchange, clearly influenced by the patrol members' obvious enthusiasm.

He took a careful bite, chewed thoughtfully, and grunted approval. "Tastes like breakfast. Better than most campaign food."

"Trust us," Venn said, addressing the room while gesturing at Thorne with obvious pride, "the Captain's got a gift for this. Kept us fed through three major campaigns and half a dozen skirmishes. There's nothing like waking up to proper hash when you're sleeping on wet ground and wondering if bandits are going to attack before dawn."

This seemed to break the dam. Soon everyone was gathered around the long tables in The Mess, sampling Thorne's offering with varying degrees of surprise and approval, though none quite matched the patrol members' obvious satisfaction.

"The potatoes are perfectly uniform," Fayne observed, measuring them with her eyes. "I didn't know you had such attention to detail with food."

"Logistics extend to nutrition," Thorne replied with dignity. "A well-fed team performs better than a hungry one."

"And you thought cooking for us would improve our performance?" Veyra asked, though her tone was warm rather than critical.

"I thought... you all do so much for others. Maybe someone should do something for you." He paused, looking slightly uncomfortable with the admission. "Besides, Grimjaw has a big day ahead. Seemed appropriate."

The dwarf in question looked up from his systematic demolition of his portion. "About that," he said, his voice carefully neutral. "Anyone know where one acquires academic robes? Apparently there's a dress code for lecturing to fancy minds."

The question produced an immediate chorus of suggestions and gentle mockery.

"I'm sure we could find you something appropriately dignified," Marcus offered. "Though I suspect the color would be a matter of some debate."

"Should be brown," Fayne suggested. "For earth and stone."

"Blue," Aldwin countered. "For wisdom and depth."

"Black," Veyra said with a faint smile, "like the soot still on your face."

Grimjaw snorted, instinctively rubbing at his cheek. "I'll lecture in my work clothes or not at all. These hands have honest dirt under the nails. Not hiding that for anyone's comfort."

"Perhaps just wash the clothes?" Aldwin suggested gently. "They are... rather aromatic."

"They're washed!" Grimjaw protested. "Recently. This month, anyway. Maybe last month."

The admission produced a collective shudder.

Marcus leaned back thoughtfully. "I could lend you something. We're roughly the same build—"

"You're a foot taller than me and half my width," Grimjaw interrupted. "I'd look like a child playing dress-up in his father's clothes."

"Finn's spare shirt?" Veyra suggested with dangerous innocence.

"The lad's shoulders are barely wider than my arm. Next suggestion."

Fayne consulted her ever-present lists. "We have spare Watch uniforms in storage. Formal dress, mostly clean—"

"Mostly?"

"There was an incident with oil lamps. But only on two of them. The others just smell like storage."

"So my options," Grimjaw said, counting on his fingers, "are wearing my own clothes that are 'aromatic,' Marcus's clothes that would make me look like I'm drowning in fabric, Finn's shirt that wouldn't cover my belly, or Watch uniforms that smell like 'storage' and possibly lamp oil."

"When you put it that way," Thorne admitted, "it does sound limiting."

"I could make something," Mistress Elba offered from the kitchen. "I've got fabric. It wouldn't be fancy, but it'd be clean and fit proper."

Grimjaw looked suspicious. "How long would that take?"

"For a simple tunic and trousers? Six hours, maybe seven." She eyed his frame critically. "Though I'd have to guess at the measurements unless you stand still for me to—"

"No."

"—measure properly," Elba finished, undeterred. "Though I suppose I could estimate based on the barrel sizes in the pantry. You're about the same circumference as the good ale cask."

"I'm being compared to a beer barrel now," Grimjaw muttered to no one in particular.

"A sturdy, well-constructed barrel," Elba clarified. "I meant it as a compliment."

"I'm sure you did."

Aldwin raised a peaceful hand. "Perhaps Grimjaw could simply... wear his least aromatic outfit and trust that the academics will be too focused on his words to notice his wardrobe?"

"Have you met academics?" Marcus asked. "They notice everything. And judge most of it."

"Then they can judge me for being practical," Grimjaw said firmly. "I'm a working dwarf giving a working dwarf's lecture. They want polish, they can hire a bard."

"We'll find you something clean," Thorne assured him. "Something that looks professional without making you uncomfortable."

"What if they ask questions I can't answer?" Grimjaw asked, giving voice to the worry that had kept him up most of the night. "These are educated minds. Theoretical knowledge. Mathematical proofs. I'm just a dwarf who's good at not dying in collapses."

"You're a dwarf who's saved more lives than most people ever meet," Veyra corrected firmly. "You understand structural engineering in ways those scholars can only theorize about. You've turned knowledge into action when it mattered most."

"But what if—"

"Then you say 'I don't know,'" Aldwin interrupted gently, echoing Finn's earlier advice. "Honesty is not a weakness, my friend. It's the foundation of true wisdom."

Marcus leaned forward, his expression growing serious. "Grimjaw, I've watched you work. You see patterns that others miss, solutions that others can't imagine. You don't just understand buildings—you understand the principles that govern how things hold together under pressure. That knowledge is precious."

"Aye, but I learned it by making mistakes. By watching good dwarves die because I wasn't smart enough or fast enough or careful enough. These academics, they learn from books."

"And books," Thorne said quietly, "are written by people who learned from experience. Your experience. Maybe it's time some of that hard-won knowledge got preserved for the next generation."

A comfortable silence settled over the long tables as they finished Thorne's carefully prepared breakfast. The food was indeed adequate—more than adequate, actually. It was nourishing, well-prepared, and made with obvious care. But more than that, it was a gift, freely given, and that made all the difference.

"So," Marcus said eventually, breaking the contemplative quiet. "What's the plan for getting our esteemed engineer to the Spire without him fleeing to the mountains?"

"We'll walk with him," Veyra decided. "All of us. Moral support and consultation."

"And if he tries to bolt?" Fayne asked.

"Then we carry him," Thorne said firmly. "He saved seven lives with his knowledge. Now he gets to share that knowledge with people who can use it to save even more lives."

Grimjaw looked around the table at the faces of his chosen family—earnest, supportive, absolutely determined to see him through this challenge whether he wanted their help or not. Despite his nervousness, he felt something warm settle in his chest.

"Right then," he said, pushing back from the table. "Let's go teach some fancy minds how not to die in a collapse."

The morning walk from the Dock Ward to the Spire of Learning usually took twenty minutes of steady walking, but with the Company moving as a group and making frequent stops, it stretched into a leisurely journey through Waterdeep's awakening commerce. The city had learned to recognize them—not just as the heroes of various rescue operations, but as neighbors, friends, part of the daily rhythm of urban life.

Their first stop was unavoidable. Harbor View Bakery sat directly on their route, its windows already glowing with warm light and the scent of fresh bread spilling into the street. Before they'd taken five steps past the door, a young woman emerged with flour-dusted hands and a wide smile.

"Master Ironbeard! Commander Thornwake!" Jenny Copperwright called out, wiping her hands on her apron. "Da! They're here!"

Her father emerged from behind the counter, a stout man with the callused hands of someone who worked with ovens and heavy bags of grain. His daughter had been trapped in a tenement fire eight months ago—one of their first major rescues after forming the Company. The gratitude in his eyes hadn't dimmed with time.

"Can't let you pass without proper provisions," he declared, pressing a wrapped bundle into Grimjaw's hands. "Fresh sweet rolls for your lecture. The honey ones you liked."

"That's not necessary—" Grimjaw began.

"It absolutely is," Jenny interrupted, adding a second package. "You're representing all of us today. The whole Dock Ward's proud of you."

"Besides," her father added with a grin, "if you're teaching the fancy folks about not dying, you'll need your strength. Can't have you fainting from hunger in front of all those books and theories."

They accepted the gifts with grace, Grimjaw grumbling good-naturedly about "unnecessary fuss" while pocketing three of the honey rolls for immediate consumption. The team exchanged amused glances—for all his protests, the dwarf was quietly pleased by the attention.

Their next interruption came at Thornfield Tools, a narrow shop wedged between a rope-maker and a ship chandler. The proprietor, an elderly dwarf with silver-streaked beard and sharp eyes, emerged before they'd even reached his door.

"Ironbeard!" Jorik Thornfield called out, his voice carrying the particular pleasure of one craftsman recognizing another. "Heard about your work at the Great Library. That business with the fallen pillar—that was first-rate engineering."

"Just reading what the stone was trying to tell me," Grimjaw replied, but Thorne caught the slight straightening of his shoulders, the quiet pride in his voice.

"Aye, and most folks wouldn't know how to listen. Here." Jorik pressed something into Grimjaw's hands—a brass compass, its face etched with precise measurements and calculations. "Made this for a surveyor who died before he could collect it. You'll have better use for it than anyone else I know."

Grimjaw examined the instrument with obvious appreciation, running his fingers over the carefully calibrated markings. "This is fine work. Too fine for—"

"For someone who just saved seven lives and is about to teach the most brilliant minds in Waterdeep how to do better?" Jorik shook his head. "Keep it. Use it. And when you're standing up there explaining how buildings talk to those who know how to listen, remember that there are craftsmen all over this city who understand exactly what you mean."

They left the shop with Grimjaw carefully tucking the compass into his vest pocket, his fingers returning to touch it periodically as they continued their journey. The gift seemed to have settled something in him—a reminder that his knowledge was valued not just by academics and nobles, but by working people who understood the practical application of expertise.

The street opened into one of Waterdeep's smaller market squares, where early vendors were setting up their stalls and calling out their wares. The Company's passage didn't go unnoticed. A group of children playing between the stalls spotted them first, their excited whispers quickly drawing adult attention.

"It's them!" a young boy announced unnecessarily. "The rescue people!"

Within moments, they were surrounded by curious faces and excited voices. The children were bold in the way of youth, pressing close with questions and wide-eyed admiration.

"Is it true you punched through solid rock?" one asked Grimjaw directly.

"Did you really carry seven people at once?" another demanded of Veyra.

"Can you teach me to be a hero too?"

Grimjaw handled the attention with surprising patience, crouching down to speak to the children at their level. "No punching involved," he explained gravely. "Just listening carefully and thinking hard about the best way to move heavy things. And I didn't carry anyone—that was teamwork. Everyone had a job, everyone did their part."

"But how did you know which rocks to move?" the first child persisted.

"Experience. And a lot of mistakes over the years. Buildings want to stand up, you know. They're designed to stay together. When they fall apart, it's usually because something went wrong. You find out what went wrong, fix it if you can, and work with what the building wants to do anyway."

"Is that what you're going to teach the smart people today?"

Grimjaw considered this seriously. "Among other things. Most smart people are good at theory. But sometimes you need someone who's been down in the dirt, made the mistakes, learned the hard lessons."

Veyra, meanwhile, had quietly purchased meat pies from a nearby vendor and was distributing them among the children. It was a small gesture, barely noticeable, but Thorne caught the vendor's grateful nod and the way the children's parents watched with obvious appreciation.

Their final stop before reaching academic territory was at the fountain in Scholars' Square, where several early risers were drawing water for their daily needs. Grimjaw cupped his hands and splashed his face, washing away the dust of travel and perhaps some of his lingering nervousness.

"Still think this is foolishness," he muttered to Aldwin, who stood beside him at the fountain's edge.

"Of course you do," Aldwin replied peacefully. "Because you're focused on all the things that could go wrong. But consider—these scholars invited you because they recognize your expertise. They want to learn from you. That's not foolishness. That's wisdom seeking wisdom."

"I'm not wise. I'm just stubborn and hard to kill."

"Sometimes those are the same thing." Aldwin's smile was gentle but firm. "You carry knowledge that could save lives, Grimjaw. Today you get to plant seeds of that knowledge in minds that can make it grow. That's not academic theory—that's practical magic."

Grimjaw dried his face with his sleeve and straightened his vest, checking that Jorik's compass was still secure in his pocket. Around him, his chosen family waited with patient support, ready to walk the final few blocks to the Spire and see him safely to his appointment with scholarly destiny.

"Right then," he said, his voice steadier now. "Let's go teach some fancy minds how to keep people from dying under rubble."

The Spire of Learning rose from its carefully manicured grounds like a declaration of intellectual ambition, its gleaming marble facade catching the morning sunlight and reflecting it back in brilliant, almost blinding sheets. Students and faculty moved across the courtyard with the particular urgency of academic minds focused on weightier matters than mere physical comfort.

The Company paused at the main gates, suddenly aware of the contrast they presented. Their practical clothing, weathered gear, and working hands marked them as distinctly non-academic visitors in a place dedicated to theoretical knowledge and scholarly pursuit.

"Second thoughts?" Marcus murmured to Veyra, noting the way several passing scholars glanced at their group with poorly concealed curiosity.

"Always," she replied. "But we're here now."

Their entrance into the main hall drew immediate attention. A young woman with ink-stained fingers and the harried expression of someone perpetually behind schedule hurried toward them, her face lighting up with genuine pleasure as she recognized their group.

"Commander Thornwake! Captain Brightward!" she called out, slightly out of breath. "I'm Scholar Miriam Goldspring. We met briefly last autumn when you helped us with the flooding in the lower archives."

Thorne remembered—a burst pipe had threatened several centuries of rare manuscripts, and the Company had spent a long, cold night moving books and setting up temporary drainage. It had been routine work, hardly worth remembering, but apparently worth remembering for the academics whose life's work had been at stake.

"Scholar Goldspring," he acknowledged with a small bow. "A pleasure to see you again."

"Is this really him?" she asked, looking at Grimjaw with the same expression she might use for a particularly fascinating historical artifact. "The Master Ironbeard who designed the Great Library extraction?"

"I am," Grimjaw replied, his voice carefully neutral. "Though I wouldn't say I designed anything. Just listened to what the building was trying to tell me."

"Remarkable! Professor Stoneforge has been analyzing your approach for days. She says your methodology represents a fundamental shift from conventional structural assessment to something far more... intuitive."

"Intuitive," Grimjaw repeated, tasting the word. "Suppose that's one way to put it."

Scholar Goldspring seemed to realize she was gushing and made a visible effort to compose herself. "The amphitheater is prepared, and we have a full attendance today. Quite full, actually. Word of your lecture has spread throughout the academic community."

"How full?" Thorne asked, noting the slight tightening around Grimjaw's eyes.

"Every seat is filled. We've had to arrange additional seating for the overflow. Professor Stoneforge estimated we'll have nearly three hundred in attendance—faculty, students, visiting scholars, and several members of the city government who specifically requested invitations."

The number seemed to hit Grimjaw like a physical blow. His hand moved unconsciously to his vest pocket, fingering the compass Jorik had given him.

"Three hundred," he muttered. "Three hundred minds waiting to hear what an old dwarf has to say about not dying in collapses."

"Three hundred minds eager to learn from your experience," Aldwin corrected gently. "Including some of the brightest engineering minds in the realm."

Professor Aldara Stoneforge appeared as if summoned by the mention of her name, her presence commanding immediate attention. She was an elderly human woman with silver hair bound in an elaborate knot and eyes that missed nothing. Her handshake with Grimjaw was firm, direct, and entirely professional.

"Master Ironbeard," she said, her voice carrying the authority of decades in academia. "I've been looking forward to this conversation for some time. Your work at the Great Library was... illuminating."

"Just did what needed doing."

"Precisely. And that, I suspect, is what makes your approach so valuable. We theorists sometimes forget that engineering serves practical purposes. Your methodology—reading structural stress patterns, identifying key support points, working with existing forces rather than against them—represents applied knowledge at its finest."

Grimjaw studied her carefully. "You're not going to ask me about mathematical proofs and theoretical frameworks?"

Professor Stoneforge's laugh was genuinely amused. "My dear dwarf, I have forty years of mathematical proofs. What I don't have is your fifty years of practical experience. Theory without application is merely intellectual exercise. Application without theory is dangerous improvisation. Today, we hope to bridge that gap."

The obvious respect in her voice seemed to do more for Grimjaw's confidence than any amount of friendly encouragement. This wasn't academic condescension or intellectual curiosity—it was one expert acknowledging another.

"Your audience," Professor Stoneforge continued, "includes some of the finest structural engineers, architects, and theoretical researchers in Faerûn. They're here because they recognize that your knowledge could advance their understanding considerably. You're not performing for them, Master Ironbeard. You're collaborating with them."

Veyra stepped forward slightly. "We'll be in the audience," she told Grimjaw. "Front row. Moral support and consultation."

"And if you need to stop, if the questions get too complex or theoretical," Thorne added, "just look at us. We'll handle the redirect."

Marcus nodded agreement. "I've managed hostile audiences before. Academics are actually quite reasonable compared to trade negotiators and diplomatic receptions."

Grimjaw looked around at his chosen family—practical, supportive, absolutely determined to see him through this challenge. The nervousness was still there, but it was balanced now by something stronger: the knowledge that he wasn't facing this alone.

He straightened his shoulders, his hand resting on the compass in his vest pocket for a final moment of reassurance. He gave Professor Stoneforge a determined nod. "Lead the way."

Professor Stoneforge smiled approvingly. "Excellent. Shall we?"

As they moved toward the amphitheater, Scholar Goldspring fell into step beside them, practically vibrating with excitement. "This is quite historic, you know. The first time we've had a practicing field engineer address the full academic assembly. Your perspective on practical application of theoretical principles could revolutionize how we approach structural education."

"Just remember," Grimjaw said, his voice carrying a note of dry humor, "if this goes badly, you'll have three hundred of the brightest minds in Waterdeep who all learned the wrong lessons about keeping buildings from falling down."

The thought seemed to amuse him, and Veyra caught the first genuine smile she'd seen from him all morning. Perhaps, she thought, he was going to be just fine.

The amphitheater doors loomed ahead, and beyond them waited three hundred eager minds, ready to learn from a master craftsman who had spent fifty years learning how to keep people alive in the worst of circumstances. It was, Veyra reflected, exactly the kind of impossible situation the Last Light Company specialized in handling.

Time to get to work.
