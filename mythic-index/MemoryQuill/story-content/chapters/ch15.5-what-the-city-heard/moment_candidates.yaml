  chapter_number: 15.5
  chapter_title: "What the City Heard"
  
  visual_thesis: "A triptych of responses to battle—candlelit grief becoming shadow calculation becoming ruined hope—showing how light and darkness both move when walls fall."
  
  dominant_mood_progression:
    - "somber remembrance"
    - "calculating menace"
    - "weary determination"
  
  color_story:
    opening: "warm candlelight gold against cold temple stone gray"
    climax: "chalk white, shadow black, knife-scored wood brown"
    closing: "ash gray rubble, faded blue wool, faint lantern amber"

  key_locations:
    - slug: "temple-steps"
      name: "Temple Steps"
      visual_character: "Cold stone steps descending from a temple entrance, crowded with citizens holding candles. The architecture is civic-religious—broad steps meant for public gatherings, columns or archways framing the scene. The darkness of evening surrounds, punctuated only by hundreds of small flames."
      time_of_day: "evening/night"
      weather_atmosphere: "cold, still air that holds candlelight steady"
      
    - slug: "silent-hand-safehouse"
      name: "Silent Hand Safehouse"
      visual_character: "A cramped, shadowed room with a table scored by years of knife work. Chalk marks cover the surface like a tactical map. The space is utilitarian and menacing—no windows, low light, the kind of room that pretends not to exist."
      time_of_day: "indeterminate (windowless)"
      weather_atmosphere: "stale, enclosed, tense"
      
    - slug: "westwall-watchpost"
      name: "Westwall Watchpost (Post-Battle)"
      visual_character: "The familiar twin-towered outpost now shows battle damage—breached walls, scorched stone, debris in the courtyard. It stands wounded but not fallen, a military shell that absorbed tremendous punishment. The commander surveys what remains."
      time_of_day: "day (implied by assessment activity)"
      weather_atmosphere: "overcast, dust-laden air, the quiet after violence"

    subtext: "The community transforms individual grief into collective resilience. The stumbling voice that steadies becomes a metaphor for the city itself—shaken but not broken. The response from the crowd shows the dead have seeded something living."

    narrative_beat: "In a room scored by knife work and long habit, a Silent Hand handler moves small stones across a chalked map. He wipes away two markers with his sleeve—'Observers lost'—and taps a northern pass with a knuckle, instructing his people to avoid wherever the Company stands."
    subtext: "The enemy recalibrates. Every candle lit at the vigil casts a shadow somewhere else. The stones moving 'like teeth' suggests the organization chewing on its losses, adapting. The Company's victory creates ripples in the underworld that will shape future conflicts."

    narrative_beat: "Commander Atlock surveys the damaged Westwall Watchpost—the walls that held, the wounds they carry. He composes a private memo recommending the Last Light Company be designated a civic partner and given a site 'built for endurance.' He notes: 'I have seen many units that could fight. Fewer that could hold.'"
    subtext: "The military mind translates admiration into action. Atlock's memo is bureaucratic love—the form his respect takes. His assessment that the Company 'leaves a place better than they found it' acknowledges something beyond tactical competence: moral character. He's planning for a future where they matter more, not less."
