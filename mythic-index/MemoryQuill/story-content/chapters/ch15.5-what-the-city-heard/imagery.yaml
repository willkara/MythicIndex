      Wide shot from below, looking up at cold stone temple steps at night.
      An acolyte stands elevated on the upper steps, lantern raised high above
      her head—the flame bright against the dark sky. She is young, her voice
      steady now after stumbling. Below her, a crowd fills the steps and street,
      each person holding a small candle. Hundreds of tiny flames create a sea
      of light. The temple columns frame the scene. Some faces are lifted toward
      the lantern, others bowed in remembrance. The mood is somber but resolute—
      grief becoming shared purpose.
    composition_notes: |
      Low angle looking up the steps. The acolyte and lantern are the apex of
      a triangular composition. The crowd forms the base, spreading down and out.
      The temple architecture provides vertical framing. Individual candle flames
      create texture across the crowd. Night sky behind provides contrast for
      the central lantern.

      Wide establishing shot of Commander Atlock walking through the ruined
      Westwall Watchpost courtyard. He is alone, hands clasped behind his back
      in characteristic posture. The courtyard shows battle damage—scorched
      stones, rubble piles, a collapsed section of wall. Afternoon light filters
      through dust, creating visible beams through gaps in the damaged structure.
      Despite the destruction, there are signs of recovery: lumber stacked for
      repairs, cleared pathways, a guild banner being raised in the distance.
      Atlock's immaculate uniform contrasts with the debris around him. His
      expression is thoughtful, assessing—a professional who has seen many
      ruins but recognizes something different here.

      Medium close-up of Commander Atlock's face and upper body. He has
      stopped walking and stands looking at something off-frame (the repair

      eyes showing something rarely seen: genuine respect. Not warmth or
      sentimentality, but the professional recognition of one soldier for
      the work of others. His scarred, weathered face is partially lit by
      afternoon sun, half in shadow. Behind him, blurred ruins provide context.

      Dread and wrongness. The enemy adapting, recalculating, moving pieces.

      Extreme close-up of a knife-scored wooden table with a chalked map.
      A handler's hand—anonymous, scarred, ring-less—moves small dark stones
      across the surface. The map shows regional routes, marked locations.
      A ring marked WESTWALL is prominent. Two smaller rings are smudged,
      being wiped away by a sleeve edge. The stones are positioned like pieces
      in a game, casting small shadows. Low lamplight from one side creates
      harsh shadows across the table's scarred surface. The atmosphere is
      cold, calculating—logistics of threat, not emotion.
    composition_notes: |
      Tight portrait framing on table surface and hand.
      The chalked map fills the frame. The hand enters from above.
      WESTWALL ring is the focal point, stones arranged around it.
      Shallow depth of field—focus on stones and immediate area.
      The wiped-away rings suggest eliminated assets.

      Close-up detail shot of a newsprint page on an editorial desk.
      The headline "Who Holds the Walls?" is visible at the top, rendered
      in formal typeface. Below, the editorial column text is partially
      visible—the key phrase "those who act with integrity" readable.
      A quill pen lies set aside on the desk, ink still wet on the nib.
      The page itself shows fresh ink, slightly gleaming in the lamplight.
      Surrounding the page: ink pot, blotting paper, other documents.
      The atmosphere conveys deadline met, conviction expressed, civic duty done.
