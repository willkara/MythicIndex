Opinion — The Westwall Watchpost did not fall yesterday because a handful of people refused to let it. Some wore City Watch colors. Others wore no uniform at all. All bled the same.

We will spend weeks tallying damages in timber and coin. We should also tally debts of a different kind. When the city sleeps warmer for strangers' courage, who funds the blankets next time?

The Last Light Company is a civic asset in all but charter. If the law cannot recognize such facts swiftly, perhaps the citizens can — with supplies, with influence, with insistence that those who act with integrity are not left to shoulder the weight alone.

The walls held. Let us decide, while we have time, who holds them tomorrow.

Resolved: That the Builders', Teamsters', and Carpenters' guilds shall dispatch on the morrow two wagons timber-grade, one wagon mixed hardware, and labor as available to the Westwall Watchpost; to be recorded as civic support, line-item promotional in the ledgers if necessary.

Debate entered: Whether the Company's symbol may be affixed (small) to repaired structures. Motion tabled; laughter recorded.

Amendment adopted: Include two cauldrons for the kitchen. Mistress Elba's representative made a persuasive case.

Names were read by candlelight on the cold steps: Watch, Company, and those who had only arrived yesterday to help and never left. An acolyte's voice stumbled twice and steadied on the third.

"For those who hold until relief arrives," she said, lifting a lantern high. "For those who go when the road is bad. For those who bring the wounded all the way home."

From the street, someone answered, not loudly but with conviction: "Light endures."

So did the crowd.

On a table scored by knife work and long habit, a handler moved small stones across a chalked map. A ring marked WESTWALL. Two smaller rings vanished with a swipe of a sleeve.

"Observers lost," he said to the room that pretended not to listen. "Advance the early-spring schedule by a week. Split consignments; use second routes. No demonstrations—too much heat."

He tapped a northern pass with a knuckle. "And if the Company keeps standing where we're going, then we don't go where they're standing. For now."

The stones clicked like teeth.

Memorandum (Uncirculated)

Assessment: Westwall cannot house a force that draws this much attention and this much goodwill. Both will only grow. Recommend formal designation of the Last Light Company as a civic partner with emergency authority under defined conditions.

Recommendation: Seek a site built for endurance rather than convenience. Old fortifications in the northern ranges meet this criterion. With proper engineering, they will outlast our arguments.

Note: I have seen many units that could fight. Fewer that could hold. Fewer still that could hold and leave a place better than they found it. We should plan as if this one will.

— C. Atlock
