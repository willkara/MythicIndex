The scene at the Great Library was one of controlled chaos. City Watch officers, their faces grim, maintained a wide cordon around what had once been the eastern wing of the Antiquities section. Now it was a wound in the earth—a ragged hole where the floor had given way, exposing sub-basement levels that hadn't seen daylight in centuries. Dust still rose from the depths in lazy spirals, carrying the smell of ancient paper and freshly broken stone.

Grimjaw planted his feet at the edge of the pit and studied the damage with the practiced eye of a master engineer. The collapse pattern told a story: water damage had weakened the foundation supports over decades, and something—a heavy cart, perhaps, or simply time—had been the final straw. The debris field was a jumble of marble floor tiles, splintered shelving, and thousands of scattered books, some still tumbling in slow-motion down unstable slopes of rubble.

"Proper foundations prevent poor structures," he muttered to himself, stroking his beard. "Someone's been neglecting their load-bearing maintenance."

City Watch officers maintained the perimeter, keeping back a growing crowd of concerned citizens, scholars, and—Grimjaw noted with distaste—reporters with quills poised. At the edge of the pit, Captain Grimsby was directing his officers, his face a mask of frustration. He saw the Last Light Company arrive and strode over to meet Thorne.

"Brightward. A hell of a mess," Grimsby said, his voice tight. He gestured with his chin toward the collapsed library. "Our engineers say they can shore it up, but it'll take twelve hours to do it safely, and they think that whole north wall is unstable. We don't have that kind of time."

Thorne nodded, his eyes scanning the wreckage. "A specialist's job, then."

"My thoughts exactly," Grimsby confirmed, his tone all business. "The call to bring you in was mine. The Lords are watching this one closely, so let's keep it clean."

"Understood, Captain," Thorne replied, the exchange sealing a moment of professional trust. "We'll get him out."

Grimsby gave a curt nod and turned back to his men, giving the Company the space they needed.

Grimjaw watched Veyra from the corner of his eye as she moved to survey the scene. She walked with her usual purposeful stride, but he'd known enough soldiers to recognize the signs. The slight hesitation before each step. The way her hands—currently occupied checking equipment—trembled almost imperceptibly when still. The careful, too-controlled breathing of someone holding themselves together by will alone.

He said nothing. Some wounds you didn't poke at. But he made sure to position himself nearby, a solid presence she could anchor to if needed.

Before anyone could take another step, a woman broke through the crowd, her face wild with panic. "My son!" she cried, pushing past a City Watch officer. "He was visiting the archives—he's still in there!"

Thorne intercepted her smoothly, his hands gentle but firm on her shoulders. "Ma'am, what's your son's name?" His voice was calm, authoritative without being harsh.

"Henrik," she gasped. "Henrik Morrow, he's only sixteen—"

"Henrik's safe," Thorne said immediately. "Medic Halden has him at the aid station, treating him for dust inhalation. Come with me." He guided her toward the medical area with practiced efficiency, pointing to where Halden was tending to survivors. "That man in the green vest—he'll take good care of your boy."

As the woman hurried away, Grimsby caught Thorne's eye and gave the slightest nod of professional approval. Whatever their past friction, competence under pressure was something he could respect.

Veyra moved to the edge of the cordon, and the world shifted.

The smell hit her first—pulverized rock, ancient dust, the particular mustiness of spaces long sealed. For a heartbeat, she was back in the canyon, the weight of the mountain pressing down, Lysander's voice echoing off stone walls. Her fingers found her lantern automatically, gripping it hard enough that the metal bit into her palm.

*Not there. Not now.* She forced herself to catalog what she saw—the angle of the debris, the dust patterns, the structural weaknesses—anything to anchor herself in the present. *Three visible entry points. Two compromised. One possible. Estimate forty feet to the sub-basement level. Clock's running.*

The professional assessment helped. It gave her something to count, something to calculate. But her hands were still trembling when she released the lantern, and she tucked them into her belt to hide it.

*Feel the cobblestones,* she told herself, pressing her boots into the solid street. *You're in Waterdeep. The sun is warm. The crowd is loud. This is not the canyon.*

But somewhere below, in the dark, a man who shared Lysander's blood was waiting. And she would not—*could not*—fail him the way she had failed his brother.

The crowd pressed close behind the barriers, citizens and nobles alike drawn by the spectacle. Reporters scribbled notes, their eyes tracking every movement of the Company members. This wasn't just another rescue—this was the Last Light Company's first major public test since gaining provisional status. Success would solidify their legitimacy; failure would invite scrutiny they couldn't afford.

Grimjaw moved past the officials, his eyes already fixed on the wreckage. He waved a dismissive hand at the gawking scholars and bureaucrats. **"Well?" his voice rumbled, loud enough to cut through the noise. "Back away or get involved. Gawking won't get him out."** He watched a fine trickle of dust fall from a high fissure. "Air's pulling north," he grunted to Veyra. "That whole section is breathing. It'll be the next to go. We stay left."

Just then, Vera and Rill arrived. Vera, leaning on her staff, caught Veyra's eye and gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. Rill’s gaze was already fixed on the torrent of water pouring from a shattered fountain into the pit, her focus as intense as Grimjaw's.

"Right," Grimjaw announced, taking command of the scene. "Veyra, Aldwin, you're with me. Rill, that water is going to be a problem. See what you can do. Everyone else, hold this perimeter. We're going in."

-->

The entry point was a narrow, treacherous slope of debris that descended into darkness like the throat of some great beast. Grimjaw led the way, his movements deliberate, each footstep tested before weight was committed. Behind him, Veyra followed in silence, her breathing carefully controlled.

The space grew tighter as they descended. Walls of collapsed shelving pressed in from both sides, creating a passage barely wide enough for Grimjaw's broad shoulders. The air thickened with dust that coated their throats and stung their eyes. Somewhere above, stone groaned—a low, grinding sound that made everyone freeze.

"Just settling," Grimjaw said quietly, but his hand had moved to touch the wall, reading the vibrations like a physician taking a pulse. "Keep moving. Slow and steady."

The darkness was absolute beyond the reach of their lanterns. Grimjaw's light cast sharp shadows that jumped and twisted with each step, making the debris field seem alive with movement. Veyra's own lantern—Lysander's lantern—burned steady at her hip, a small circle of gold in the pressing black.

*Three exits. All compromised. Debris shifting every forty seconds. Approximately thirty feet to go.*

She counted because counting kept her present. She counted because if she stopped counting, she would remember the last time she had crawled through rubble in the dark, alone, her fingers bloody, calling names that no one would ever answer again.

They soon came to a choke point where the collapse had wedged massive slabs of floor and ceiling together in a chaotic, impassable tangle. Grimjaw studied it for a long moment, his experienced eye tracing stress lines invisible to everyone else.

"No way through," Venn muttered from behind them.

"There is no other way," Grimjaw said calmly. He handed his war-hammer to Veyra and approached the wall of debris, his eyes settling on a smaller, seemingly insignificant block of granite wedged deep inside the pile.

"Everyone thinks you solve a collapse by moving the biggest rocks," he said, his voice a low rumble that cut through the tension. "Amateurs. Brute force is the last resort, not the first. First, you use your head. You find the one piece that's holding the whole damn thing up." He pointed. "That one. The keystone. It's carrying all the lateral stress. We nudge it, the pile settles, and it gives us a path. Precision, not power. That's how you do it right."

The city engineer, who had crept closer, looked intrigued and concerned. "By the book, that shouldn't work," he murmured, more to himself than anyone else. "The resonant frequencies... you risk liquefaction of the surrounding debris field. It's an unorthodox approach."

Grimjaw ignored him. "Darric, Venn. Pry bars. Not for leverage. For precision. I need you to nudge it forward, no more than a hand's breadth. On my mark."

What followed was not an act of force, but of surgery. Under Grimjaw's precise, quiet commands, the two powerful soldiers carefully inserted their bars. "A little to the left, Darric. Feel the grain. Let the stone tell you where it wants to go."

There was a terrifying, deep groan. The entire pile of debris shifted with a sound like grinding teeth. Then, with a final, shuddering sigh, the rubble settled into a new, more stable configuration. A narrow, stable tunnel had opened where the impassable wall had been.

Grimjaw took his hammer back from a wide-eyed Veyra. "Now we go."

They descended further, encountering the flooded chamber. A burst pipe from a fountain system was pouring water into the area, and sputtering magical light fixtures sent arcs of energy crackling across the surface. Rill stepped forward. "My turn." She extended her hands, her palms open towards the churning water. She didn't shout or command; she spoke to it, her voice a low murmur, like greeting an old friend. "Easy now. I know you're confused by all this stone and metal. Let me show you where you want to flow." The water seemed to listen, its chaotic churning settling into purposeful currents that carved a clear, damp path through the center of the flood.

"The path will hold as long as I focus," Rill said, her brow beaded with sweat. "Go. Quickly."

The space beyond the flooded chamber was a small pocket of improbable survival—a void where falling debris had created an accidental shelter, like the eye of a storm. Ancient scrolls lay scattered across the floor, their preservation spells the only reason they hadn't crumbled to dust. A reading desk had been crushed flat. And beneath a heavy, ornate bookshelf that had fallen at just the right angle to create a protective lean-to, they found Master Cassius Valerius.

For a terrible moment, Grimjaw thought they were too late. The scholar lay motionless in the dim light, his face pale beneath a coating of grey dust, one leg trapped beneath the shelf's massive frame. No movement. No sound.

Then Cassius stirred, and Grimjaw heard Veyra's sharp intake of breath beside him.

The scholar's eyes opened—and Veyra's world tilted sideways.

It was Lysander's jawline. Lysander's steady gaze. The same quiet composure in the face of danger, the same stubborn refusal to show fear. For a heartbeat that stretched into eternity, time fractured. The rubble around her became canyon stone, dust became ash, and the man before her was reaching up with that same calm determination that had marked her lost friend's final moments. She could hear his voice: *Live. Remember. Rescue.*

Her hand moved toward her scarred throat before she caught herself, fingernails biting into her palm. The pain helped. It anchored her.

*Not him. Not there. Not now. Focus. Count something. Anything.*

"Are you hurt?" Veyra asked, and her voice emerged steady—each word a deliberate step back toward the present, toward the mission, away from the ghost she saw in this man's face.

"My leg," Cassius replied, his voice hoarse but remarkably composed for a man who had spent hours trapped in darkness. "I can feel it, so that's something. I tried not to move—didn't want to bring anything else down." He managed a weak smile. "I had time to think about proper structural load distribution. Funny what the mind focuses on."

Grimjaw found himself nodding in approval. "Smart thinking. Rocks don't care about panic—they respond to physics."

Aldwin was already moving, his small form navigating the cramped space with practiced ease. His hands began to glow with a soft, golden light as he knelt beside Cassius, assessing the injury with gentle precision.

"Deep breath now," Aldwin murmured, his voice carrying the same gentle authority he used with wounded soldiers and frightened children alike. "I'm going to assess the fracture first—you'll feel warmth, nothing more." His touch was careful, fingers tracing the break with clinical accuracy while divine energy flowed to knit bone and ease muscle trauma. His brow furrowed in concentration, then smoothed. "Compound fracture, but clean. The bone set itself well when you stopped moving. There—the worst is past. The swelling should subside quickly."

Cassius's face relaxed as the pain receded, color returning beneath the dust. "A healer's touch. Thank you." He studied Veyra's face with scholar's attention to detail, his gaze lingering on her scars, her lantern, her rigid posture. "Thornwake... that name sounds familiar. Have we met? You seem to be looking at me as though you've seen a ghost."

The observation was too accurate. Veyra's composure cracked for just a moment—a flicker of something raw and wounded crossing her features before the mask slammed back into place.

"Focus on staying calm," she said, her voice dropping quieter—the way it always did when she was most in danger of breaking. "We'll talk once you're safe."

*Once we're out of this tomb,* she didn't say. *Once I can breathe without tasting ash.*

-->

The extraction required the same surgical precision as their entry—and perhaps more nerve. The bookshelf pinning Cassius was also supporting a critical section of the ceiling. Remove it wrong, and the entire pocket would collapse.

Grimjaw circled the shelf twice, studying it from every angle, his fingers tracing the wood grain, the metal fittings, the way it wedged against the stone above. The others waited in tense silence.

"We lift, it all comes down," he finally stated, his voice flat with certainty. "So we don't lift. We pivot."

He directed the team in wrapping heavy chains around the massive shelf, connected to a makeshift lever system of heavy timbers scavenged from the debris. The work was slow, meticulous—each placement checked and rechecked. Above them, the ceiling continued its ominous settling sounds, dust sifting down in thin streams that caught the lantern light like falling snow.

"Darric, your lever needs to be a hand's breadth lower. We're pivoting on the back corner, not tipping the whole thing over. Venn, wrap the chain twice below that bronze crest, once above. We're guiding it, not strangling it."

He turned to Veyra, and his voice softened slightly—the paternal undertone he usually reserved for Finn. "Commander, you and Aldwin have one chance to pull him clear. The moment I give the word, you move. Don't hesitate. Don't look up. Just move." He pointed to a crack running across the ceiling. "Watch the dust from that fissure. If the pattern changes—I mean *at all*—the conversation is over. Everyone out. No arguments."

Veyra nodded, positioning herself at Cassius's side. Her hands had stopped trembling—there was no room for fear when someone's life depended on her grip being sure.

"Ready?" Grimjaw planted his feet wide. "Now... on my mark."

The system engaged with a deafening screech of tortured wood and metal. The massive bookshelf pivoted, groaning like a living thing, and for one terrible second, Grimjaw thought he'd miscalculated. The ceiling crack widened. Dust cascaded down. Someone—Venn—swore under his breath.

Then the shelf locked into its new position, pivoted just enough to free Cassius's leg.

"NOW!"

Veyra moved without thought, her hands finding Cassius's arms, Aldwin bracing his injured leg, and together they pulled him free. The shelf groaned back into place an instant later, and the ceiling held—barely, but it held.

Cassius laughed weakly, the sound edged with hysteria. "I've never been so grateful for precise engineering in my life."

"Thank me when we're topside," Grimjaw grunted, already assessing their exit route.

The journey back was a nightmare of narrow passages and unstable footing. They carried Cassius on an improvised stretcher made from his own ruined desk, moving in careful stages while Grimjaw tested each section of their path. Twice, they had to stop while debris shifted around them. Once, a stone the size of a man's head crashed down behind them, missing Venn by inches.

Halfway back through their carefully carved path, a chunk of masonry had shifted, blocking their exit route entirely. The flooded chamber behind them was already filling again—Rill's control had faded the moment she left the area.

No way back. No way forward.

Grimjaw studied the obstruction for exactly three seconds, then a low grin spread across his weathered face. "That first one needed a surgeon's touch," he rumbled, hefting his war-hammer with obvious satisfaction. "This one just needs a hammer."

The precisely placed blow sent the obstruction tumbling aside with a satisfying crash. Stone fragments scattered, and beyond them—daylight. The blessed, golden light of a Waterdeep afternoon.

When they finally emerged from the pit, the cheer that erupted from the waiting crowd was a physical wave of sound—a wall of noise that crashed over them like the tide.

The emergence was a slow, careful procession from darkness into light. The muffled silence of the pit gave way to the roar of the crowd, a sound that was both jarring and validating after the pressing quiet below. Darric and Venn came first, their movements economical despite obvious exhaustion as they maneuvered the makeshift stretcher bearing Cassius. Both men were covered head to toe in grey dust, looking like statues come to life.

Aldwin followed, his small form somehow seeming larger than usual as he walked with the satisfied stride of a healer who had done his work well. His hands were still faintly glowing with residual divine energy, and his eyes never left his patient.

Rill was next, looking pale and drawn—the sustained effort of commanding that much water had taken its toll. The moment she stepped clear of the pit, the carefully diverted stream behind them lost its guidance and collapsed back into a churning, muddy flood with a distant crash. She stumbled, her legs giving way, and Vera was instantly there to steady her despite her own weakness.

"Easy," Vera murmured. "I've got you. Water speaker's exhaustion—I've seen it before. You pushed yourself too far."

"Had to hold it," Rill managed, leaning heavily on her friend. "Couldn't let them drown on the way back."

Veyra came next, blinking in the sudden brightness, her armor and clothes stained with dust and debris. Her hands, she noticed distantly, had stopped trembling. Something had shifted during the descent—some knot of fear had loosened in the act of doing what she did best. Saving someone. Bringing them home.

Grimjaw was the last one out, his boots planting firmly on the cobblestones with the solid finality of a period at the end of a sentence. He took one look back into the hole—a master surveying completed work—then turned and gave a single, definitive nod to Thorne. *The job is done.*

The crowd's cheer was a wave of sound that crashed over them like a physical force. Reporters, held back by the Watch cordon, shouted questions over each other in a cacophony of competing voices. "How did you do it?" "Is he alive?" "What caused the collapse?" "Commander Thornwake, over here!"

Marcus, ever the diplomat, stepped smoothly between the Company and the press, his charming smile firmly in place despite the dust coating his usually immaculate clothes. "Master Valerius is safe, and the Company is seeing to his care. A full report will be made to the Lords. Thank you for your patience." His tone made it clear that was all they were getting, and somehow made them feel grateful for even that much.

Medic Halden met them with a wheeled stretcher, his medical kit already open. "Report," he said to Aldwin, his voice pure professionalism cutting through the chaos.

"Compound fracture of the left tibia, now magically set and stabilized," Aldwin reported back, his voice equally crisp despite exhaustion. "Treated for shock and minor abrasions. Dehydration—he'll need fluids. Vitals are strong. He's a tough one."

"They usually are, the scholars," Halden said, a rare note of warmth in his usually clinical tone. "Something about all that reading builds stubbornness."

Together, the two healers transferred Cassius with the seamless efficiency of soldiers who had done this a hundred times before—which, in fact, they had. The city engineer who had questioned Grimjaw's methods pushed his way to the front of the crowd. He stood there for a long moment, staring at the dwarf with an expression caught somewhere between professional jealousy and genuine awe. Then, wordlessly, he tipped his head in a gesture of profound, academic respect—one craftsman acknowledging a master.

Grimjaw acknowledged the gesture with a grunt that might have been modest or might have been "obviously." With him, it was hard to tell.

Captain Grimsby watched it all from his position by the cordon, his arms crossed, his expression unreadable. Then he caught Thorne's eye and gave that same sharp nod—the one that communicated volumes in a single gesture. *You were the right tool for the job. Don't let it go to your head.*

Veyra watched her team work. Saw Marcus handle the press, deflecting questions with practiced ease. Saw Thorne coordinate with the Watch, his military bearing earning Grimsby's grudging respect. Saw Aldwin and Halden transfer their patient with synchronized precision. Saw Vera supporting Rill despite her own weakness, and Grimjaw accepting the engineer's respect with characteristic gruffness.

She saw a machine of interlocking parts, each moving in perfect concert. She saw people who trusted each other, who relied on each other, who would walk into darkness together and walk out again because none of them was willing to leave anyone behind.

It was the polar opposite of the canyon's lonely, singular failure. Here, there was support. There was a system. There was success.

*This is what Lysander wanted to build,* she realized. *This is what he saw in us, all those years ago. A family that fights together.*

And today, they had proven him right.

As the medics loaded Cassius onto the waiting wagon for the short trip to the Temple of Tyr, he stirred, reaching out to catch Veyra's sleeve before she could step away. His grip was weak but insistent.

"Wait. Please." His dust-caked face was earnest, scholarly even in exhaustion. "Your name. Thornwake. It came to me while I was down there, in the dark. My brother... Lysander. He mentioned that name in his letters. Years ago. You knew him?"

The question hit Veyra like a physical blow. She had prepared herself for this moment—had rehearsed what she might say—but the reality of it stole her breath.

"Yes," she managed. "I knew him."

Cassius's eyes—so like his brother's—searched her face. "He wrote that he'd found people worth believing in. Worth fighting for. He said..." He paused, gathering strength. "He said he'd finally found his purpose. I never understood what he meant until now."

Veyra's vision blurred. She blinked hard, forcing the tears back. Not here. Not in public. Not yet.

"He was..." Her voice cracked, and she had to start again. "He was the best man I ever knew. And I will tell you everything—how he lived, how he led, how he died saving us all. But not today. Today you need to heal."

"He would have admired what you've done," Cassius said, his voice fading as exhaustion pulled him toward sleep. "Coming into the dark for a stranger."

"You're not a stranger," Veyra whispered, but he had already slipped into unconsciousness, his hand still loosely gripping her sleeve.

She stood there for a long moment, watching the wagon roll toward the Temple of Tyr. The crowd had begun to disperse, the excitement of the rescue giving way to ordinary afternoon business. But Veyra remained rooted in place, one hand pressed to her chest where a knot of grief and relief had tangled together into something she couldn't quite name.

A solid presence materialized beside her. Grimjaw, saying nothing, simply standing there with his feet planted wide, an anchor in a shifting world.

"You did good, Commander," he said finally, his voice a low rumble. "Lysander's brother lives because of what we built together."

*This time, we dig together.* The words from that morning echoed in her mind.

Today, they had. And for the first time since the canyon, a piece of the weight on Veyra's soul felt... lighter.

She touched her lantern—Lysander's lantern—and could have sworn the flame flickered in response. Probably just the breeze off the harbor. Probably.

"Let's go home," she said quietly.

But as she turned to rejoin her company, she let herself pause behind a pillar—just for a moment, just out of sight—and allowed the tears to fall. Three silent, shaking breaths, her hand pressed over her mouth to contain the sound. Then she wiped her face, straightened her spine, and walked back into the light.

Commander Thornwake had held it together. The mission was complete. The ledger was a little more balanced.

Tomorrow, she would tell Cassius the truth about his brother's sacrifice. But tonight—tonight, she would allow herself to grieve and to hope in equal measure. They had brought Lysander's brother home.

It wasn't redemption. Not yet. But it was a start.
