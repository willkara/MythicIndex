  prompt: 'A dwarven engineer - **Height/Build**: Stocky dwarf built for endurance

    - **Hair**: Iron-gray beard braided with small metal charms - pieces of rare ore
    found over the years and tiny tools that have served him well

    - **Eyes**: Bright, keen eyes that still hold curiosity despite his age

    - **Distinguishing Features**: Weathered hands and face from decades underground

    - **Typical Clothing**: Practical mining clothes: reinforced leather with metal

    Grimjaw Ironbeard is a master dwarven engineer of advanced age. He has a stocky,
    powerful build and a weathered face from decades spent underground. His long,
    iron-gray beard is braided with small metal charms and tools. He typically wears
    practical, reinforced leather mining clothes and a wide belt with various pouches.
    stands before a massive, impassable wall of rubble from a building collapse. With
    a knowing expression, he points to a single, small keystone, the elegant solution
    to the chaotic problem. A skeptical city engineer looks on. The scene contrasts
    the scale of the problem with the precision of the solution.. Visual details:
    Grimjaw stands before a seemingly impassable wall of debris, pointing out a single,
    small stone to his team. The city engineer looks on with skepticism.. Composition:
    Focus on the contrast between the massive scale of the rubble and the smallness
    of the keystone. Grimjaw is depicted as a figure of wisdom, not just strength..
