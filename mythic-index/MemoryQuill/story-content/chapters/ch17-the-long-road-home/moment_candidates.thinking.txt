Key visual moments:
1. **The column procession** - A stark visual tableau emerges: forty disciplined cavalry escorting a battered group of rescuers, wounded soldiers lying in wagons. The elite guard's pristine formation sharply contrasts with the broken heroes they protect, creating a powerful metaphor of sacrifice and honor.

2. **Finn walking beside Vera's wagon** - In an intimate moment of devotion, Finn gently rests his hand on the wagon's wooden side, softly speaking to the unconscious Vera. His quiet vigil speaks volumes about their bond, revealing deep emotional connection amid physical and psychological exhaustion.

3. **Aldwin and Halden working together** - Moving with synchronized precision, they operate as a seamless unit of quiet competence. Their collaborative effort suggests how intense shared experiences can dissolve previous philosophical differences, transforming them into an almost telepathic partnership.

4. **Fayne on supply wagon with ledger** - Meticulously recording details in her ledger, Fayne creates neat columns as a small yet defiant gesture against surrounding chaos. Her methodical approach becomes a subtle act of resistance, maintaining personal control within an unpredictable environment.

Durja's reaction captures a moment of pure character revelation. With massive hands planted firmly on the bar, she sighs - a gesture that perfectly encapsulates her no-nonsense personality. Her physical stance and verbal response demonstrate a blend of weariness and humor that speaks volumes about her nature.

Marcus approaches with calculated charm, sliding a purse across the surface. His practiced maneuver reveals a well-honed social strategy, attempting to smooth over potential tensions through a combination of monetary persuasion and personal charisma.

The leadership table presents a tableau of shared exhaustion. Council members hunched over steaming stew, their collective fatigue creating a visceral sense of mutual understanding and struggle. Each slumped shoulder and weary expression tells a story of prolonged challenge.

Aldwin's wordless gesture of sliding bread to Veyra emerges as a profound moment of unspoken care. This simple action reveals deep layers about both characters - Aldwin as a quiet caretaker, Veyra as a leader so consumed by responsibility that she neglects her own basic needs.

The camp scene unfolds with small fires punctuating the surrounding darkness. These scattered flames create a subtle constellation, symbolizing the Company's resilience and interconnectedness. Cavalrymen huddle close, their proximity suggesting both physical warmth and emotional solidarity.

Aldwin and Halden work side by side, their comfortable silence speaking volumes about their evolving professional relationship. Cleaning instruments together, they demonstrate a newfound mutual respect, their movements synchronized and purposeful.

Their interaction reveals a profound transformation, healing previous divisions between them. The firelight casts soft shadows, highlighting their shared commitment to the Company's mission.

Veterans exchange observations about recent events, their dialogue revealing subtle insights into the group's dynamics. Though secondary characters, their conversation adds depth to the narrative's broader context.

Grimjaw and Fayne engage in collaborative sketching, their interaction blending humor and practical calculation. Their contrasting approaches to mapping the parapet suggest a nuanced partnership.

The scene captures both characters with remarkable precision, exploring the tension between dreams and pragmatic reality. Their dialogue reveals intricate layers of personal philosophy.

Veyra and Finn's conversation on the stone wall becomes a poignant meditation on mortality. The hot cider symbolizes warmth and connection as Veyra imparts wisdom, marking a significant moment of mentorship and personal growth.

Marcus stands alone, bathed in the pulsing light of the sending stone, embodying the weight of an unseen political conflict. His solitary preparation suggests a profound internal struggle.

The sending stone scene illuminates Marcus's deeper role, revealing the complexity of his mission through the metaphorical interplay of light and darkness. Two distinct types of war converge in this moment of quiet intensity.

Under the starry sky, Veyra and Marcus reflect on their parallel leadership, their temporary camp a "small constellation" representing transient unity and the long journey ahead.

The selection process demands strategic narrative moments: a hero's perspective, a pivotal transition, and an intimate character revelation. The requirements emphasize narrative diversity - different locations, characters, and emotional landscapes - ensuring a rich, multifaceted storytelling approach.

The chosen scenes capture critical narrative beats: Veyra's heroic stance in the ruined courtyard and the transformative procession marking a fundamental shift from defense to migration.

Key character moments illuminate relationships and personal growth. Finn's loyalty beside Vera's wagon, the mentor-student dynamic between Veyra and Finn on the stone wall, and the evolving professional bond between Aldwin and Halden reveal deeper interpersonal connections.

Symbolic scenes like Marcus with the sending stone add visual intrigue and thematic depth, hinting at future narrative trajectories.

The selection maintains visual and emotional variety, ensuring each moment contributes uniquely to the storytelling landscape. I need to redistribute moments to avoid clustering in one scene. The current breakdown reveals scene 17-02 and 17-04 have multiple moments, which risks narrative repetition. I'll strategically select scenes to ensure visual storytelling diversity while maintaining the core narrative flow. Specifically, I'll evaluate whether the Finn/Vera wagon moment truly adds unique value or can be replaced with a more distinctive scene interaction. I'm tracking the scene selection process, considering character variety and moment scores. The current approach involves strategically choosing scenes to balance narrative coverage and character representation. I'm weighing different moments from various scenes, looking for a mix that provides depth and interesting perspectives while avoiding repetitive sequences.

The key considerations include scene scores, character prominence, and maintaining narrative flow. I'm particularly focused on including moments that showcase different characters and emotional states, ensuring a rich and diverse narrative selection.

The emerging selection prioritizes key character moments like Veyra in the ruined courtyard and scenes that offer unique insights into the story's progression. I'm carefully examining each potential scene's contribution to the overall narrative understanding.

The challenge is finding the right balance between scene distribution, character variety, and maintaining the rule of no more than two consecutive moments from the same scene. This requires careful selection and strategic placement of narrative moments.

I'll explore two potential approaches: inserting a moment from scene 17-03 to break up the consecutive 17-04 moments, or removing one of the 17-04 moments entirely. The Durja reaction could serve as an effective scene separator, providing a sharp tonal shift and preventing scene clustering.

The goal is to create a sequence that feels dynamic, reveals character progression, and adheres to the structural guidelines while preserving the narrative flow and emotional nuance of the key interactions.

Analyzing the location distribution reveals a balanced spread: Westwall Watchpost, Road to Waterdeep, and Wayward Compass Fields each represent distinct narrative spaces. Adding the Wayward Compass interior introduces a fourth location, enriching the scene's spatial complexity.

The six-moment sequence offers a comprehensive narrative arc, with each moment serving a specific storytelling function - from establishing the hero's initial state to exploring character dynamics and symbolic elements.

Key moments strategically cover hero perspective, pivotal transitions, and character interactions, ensuring a nuanced narrative progression across multiple locations.

The scene selection demonstrates balanced character representation with varied focus points, maintaining narrative complexity while avoiding clustering in single scenes.

Verification confirms scene diversity, character breadth, and structural integrity of the narrative sequence.
