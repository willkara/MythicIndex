The morning after the celebration felt like the morning of a funeral. The last of the civilian wagons had departed at dawn, their cheerful goodbyes echoing in a courtyard that now seemed unnervingly quiet. What remained was the silence of aftermath, the smell of wet ash and ozone, and the stark, undeniable reality of the damage. The wind whispered through the splintered timbers of the gatehouse, a mournful sound that seemed to carry the ghosts of the fallen. Personal effects—a dropped mug here, a scorched scrap of a banner there—were scattered across the rubble-strewn ground, each a tiny testament to the violence of the assault.

Veyra stood in the center of the courtyard, her arm in a sling, her good eye taking in the full scope of their loss. The gate hung from a single hinge like a broken jaw. The eastern wall was a jagged wound of splintered timber and fractured stone. The northern tower leaned at an angle that made Grimjaw physically ill to look at. For a fleeting, terrifying moment, the scent of the ash transported her back to the suffocating heat of Undershade Canyon. The same feeling of profound loss, of a home burned to the ground. But this time was different. Last time, she had been the sole survivor. This time, she was the commander of survivors. The weight of it was a physical thing.

Commander Atlock approached, his footsteps crunching on rubble. He moved with the grim purpose of a man delivering bad news he knew was already understood. Thorne and Grimjaw joined them, forming a small, somber council of war in the ruins of their home.

"It's a total loss," Atlock said, his voice devoid of ceremony. "Structurally unsound, indefensible, and it will take months of work just to make it habitable, let alone secure. You can't stay here."

No one argued. The truth was written in every broken stone.

"I've already sent a rider to Waterdeep," Atlock continued. "My recommendation for your company to be granted 'Provisional Civic Asset' status will be on the Lords' desk by midday. That will give you legitimacy, a legal standing you've lacked." He held up a hand before anyone could express relief. "But understand this: I am a commander, not a politician. My word opens doors, it doesn't build houses. Securing you a temporary billet will be a fight. Securing a permanent one..." He let the sentence hang in the cold air.

"We understand, Commander," Thorne said. "We're grateful for your support, whatever form it takes."

"For now," Atlock said, "your place is in the city. My men will escort you. We'll find you a place to operate from, to tend your wounded, to regroup."

Veyra looked around at the Watchpost. She saw not the wreckage, but the ghosts of what they had built. She saw Finn mucking out the stables, Mistress Elba chasing a cat from her kitchen, the corner where Aldwin's herbs had grown. It had been cramped, imperfect, and constantly in need of repair, but it had been theirs. It had been home.

"Give the order," she said to Thorne, her voice quiet but firm. "Pack what's salvageable. We leave in one hour."

The road south was a slow, somber procession. The column was a strange and tragic sight: forty of Atlock's elite cavalry, their blue and silver cloaks bright against the drab landscape, acting as an honor guard for a ragged band of rescuers. The Last Light Company's wounded rode in wagons, their faces pale and drawn.

In one wagon, Vera Moonwhisper lay still as death, her breathing shallow. The Archdruid and his aides had stabilized her, but she was a flickering candle in a high wind. Finn, his own ribs tightly bound, walked alongside her wagon, his hand resting on the worn wood. "You're safe now, Vera," he murmured, his voice for her ears only. "We've got you. Echo's safe, too. He's flying escort. Just... just come back."

The rest of the Company walked or rode, their gear packed hastily, their expressions a mixture of exhaustion and grim resolve. Aldwin and Halden moved as one between the wagons, a seamless unit of quiet competence. "Pressure dressing on this one," Aldwin would murmur, and Halden would already have it in hand. "Fever tea for the next," Halden would say, and Aldwin would be reaching for the correct herbs. The battlefield had burned away their philosophical differences, leaving only the shared, sacred work.

Fayne sat on the back of a supply wagon, a ledger balanced on their knees, trying to create a coherent inventory from the chaos of their departure, their neat columns a small act of defiance against the disorder of their lives.

They were a company of the broken, leaving a broken home, with no clear destination but the cold comfort of the city.

Dusk was settling as they reached the crossroads after four days of slow evacuation with their wounded, twice the normal travel time but necessary for careful transport. The Wayward Compass stood as it always had, a squat, solid presence against the fading light. Smoke curled from its chimneys, promising warmth and ale.

The sheer size of their column brought the inn's few patrons to the windows. When Thorne, his face a mask of road dust and fatigue, pushed open the door, the common room fell silent. Every eye turned to him, then to the sea of armed soldiers and wounded rescuers visible behind him.

Durja, the orc innkeeper, was wiping down the bar with a rag. She looked up, her scarred face taking in Thorne, then Veyra behind him, then the unmistakable form of Grimjaw, and finally the uniformed presence of Commander Atlock. She paused, her gaze sweeping over the forty cavalrymen visible in the twilight. She put down her rag with deliberate slowness, placed both massive hands on the bar, and sighed. The sound was a low rumble of profound, bone-deep weariness.

"For fuck's sake," she said, her voice carrying across the silent room.

A choked laugh escaped Grimjaw. Before the bewildered Commander Atlock could fully process the greeting, Marcus Heartbridge stepped smoothly forward, his expensive clothes looking utterly out of place and yet perfectly natural.

"My dear Durja," he began, his voice a balm of pure, practiced charm. "A sentiment we all share, I assure you. To descend upon your legendary oasis of tranquility like a conquering army is a crime against hospitality, one for which we must atone."

Durja gave a slow, deliberate eye-roll that conveyed years of dealing with smooth-talkers. "Get on with it, peacock."

Marcus's smile didn't falter. "Right. We need provisions for eighty, a round for everyone in this fine establishment for their patience, and your boundless tolerance." He slid the heavy purse across the bar. "And this, for the crime."

Durja eyed the purse, then Marcus's unshakeable smile, and gave a single, sharp nod. The gold was practical, but the apology, however flowery, was noted. Grimjaw walked past Marcus, clapping him on the shoulder. "You fight with your tongue and your purse, peacock. Can't argue with the results."

While the massive order was being prepared, Durja cleared a large table in the corner for the Company's core leadership. Atlock, Veyra, Thorne, Tomaq, Grimjaw, Aldwin, and Fayne sat down, a council of the exhausted. Hot stew and cold ale were brought, and for a few minutes, the only sounds were the scraping of spoons and weary sighs. 

Atlock took a long pull of his ale. "Better than field rations," he grunted to Thorne.

"Aye, but not by much," Grimjaw grumbled, poking at a piece of gristle in his bowl. "Tastes like they boiled an old boot in it."

Tomaq let out a low chuckle. "Heard you lost a boot in the north wall collapse, Grimjaw. Maybe you're finally reunited."

The dwarf shot him a look that was somehow both murderous and amused, before returning to his meal. Across the table, Aldwin noticed Veyra was just pushing the stew around her bowl. Without a word, he slid his own untouched piece of bread over to her plate. Veyra gave him a small, grateful nod and finally took a bite.

Atlock surveyed the table—the battered, bruised, and utterly spent heroes of Westwall. A rare, weary smile touched his face. "Gods, look at us. A right mess."

"The finest mess I've ever had the honor to serve with, Commander," Thorne replied, his voice quiet but firm. The respect for the rank was there, but the tone was one of deep, personal camaraderie.

They made camp in the fields beside the inn, the cavalry forming a professional, defensible perimeter. The inn became their supply depot, Durja's staff providing food and ale with a grumbling efficiency that was her version of hospitality. Small fires dotted the darkness, each one a circle of warmth and quiet conversation.

In what passed for the command tent, Atlock, Thorne, and Tomaq shared a bottle of brandy Marcus had left with the Commander's aide. "For medicinal purposes," the note had read.
"I'll have to file a full report," Atlock said, swirling the amber liquid in his cup. "The Lords' Committee will want details. I'm still trying to phrase the part where a dire wolf turned the tide of the battle. 'Utilization of unconventional local assets' sounds a bit dry."
"You could call it a 'force multiplier,'" Thorne suggested, a rare smile touching his lips. "Grimsby would appreciate the military jargon."
Tomaq, who had been quietly observing, looked at Thorne with a wry glint in his one good eye. "Still mad, Captain?"
Thorne let out a short, tired laugh and raised his cup to the orc lieutenant. "Never, Tom. Your timing was impeccable."
"It's a stubbornness I'm coming to admire in your Company, Brightward," Atlock added. "You don't break. You just... find a new way to stand."

Near the medical wagon, Aldwin and Halden worked in comfortable silence, cleaning and sterilizing their instruments by firelight. The frantic energy of the battle was gone, replaced by a quiet synergy. "That splint we improvised for the trooper with the shattered leg," Halden said, his voice low. "It held all the way here. I wouldn't have thought of using a shield strap for the tension."
"And I wouldn't have had the strength to set the bone properly without you," Aldwin replied, not as a master to a student, but as one professional to another. "You have good hands for it, Halden. Steady."
"Learned from a good teacher," Halden said simply. They shared a look of mutual, weary respect. The debate was over. The work remained.

By another fire, two of Atlock's cavalrymen, veterans with grey in their beards, spoke quietly. "Never seen anything like it," one said, staring into the flames. "Fought alongside Watchmen before. Good soldiers. But these... they're something else. That dwarf... Grimjaw. Saw him hold a collapsing wall with a table and sheer bloody-mindedness."
"And the commander," the other added. "The Ash-Marked. She moves like a ghost, but fights like a demon. They don't give up. Not an inch."

Grimjaw and Fayne sat by their own fire, a piece of slate between them, sketching with charcoal. "Right," Grimjaw grunted, sketching a ridiculously oversized dwarven parapet. "The Bastion needs a triple-thick wall on the north face, with self-resetting ballistae every forty feet."
"The cost of which would be roughly equivalent to the entire annual tax revenue of a small barony," Fayne countered, not looking up from their own calculations. "And the logistical train for the materials would require a dedicated road, which adds another thirty percent to the initial outlay. I suggest a reinforced wall and a series of well-placed choke points."
"Bah! Choke points are for elves," Grimjaw grumbled, but he erased the third layer of wall. "Fine. But I'm keeping the magma trap."

Veyra had found a spot on a low stone wall, away from the main fires, needing a moment of quiet. Finn found her there, carrying two cups of hot cider.
"Mistress Elba's orders," he said, handing one to her. "She said you looked like you were trying to carry the whole world again."
"It's a heavy world," Veyra admitted, accepting the cup.
"I thought I was going to die," Finn said suddenly, his voice barely a whisper. "When that orc... Serka... was standing over me. I saw the axes coming down."
"We all have that moment, Finn," Veyra said, her gaze distant. "The one where you see the end. The trick isn't to avoid it. It's to decide what you're going to do in the single breath you have before it happens." She looked at him, her expression softening just a fraction. "You did good, Finn. You held your ground. That's more than most can say."

Later, as the camp settled into a low murmur, Veyra saw a lone figure near the road, bathed in the faint, pulsating light of a sending stone. Marcus. He finished his message as she approached.
"Getting a head start on the next battle?" she asked quietly.
"The next battlefield," he corrected, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. "The physical fight is over, Veyra. Now comes the political one. The Lords' Committee will be sharpening their knives. Budgets, jurisdictions, formal complaints from Grimsby... it's a different kind of war, and it's the one I fight. Get some rest. You've earned it. My part is just beginning."

They stood in silence for a moment, the two commanders of two different kinds of war, watching the stars emerge. The camp was a small constellation of lights in a vast darkness, a temporary home on the long road to somewhere else—two days of medical stabilization and resupply before the final careful journey to Waterdeep.
