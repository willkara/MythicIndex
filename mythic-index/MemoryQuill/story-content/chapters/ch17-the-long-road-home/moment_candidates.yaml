    source_excerpts:
      - "Veyra had found a spot on a low stone wall, away from the main fires, needing a moment of quiet."
      - "'I thought I was going to die,' Finn said suddenly, his voice barely a whisper. 'When that orc... Serka... was standing over me. I saw the axes coming down.'"
      - "'We all have that moment, Finn,' Veyra said, her gaze distant. 'The one where you see the end. The trick isn't to avoid it. It's to decide what you're going to do in the single breath you have before it happens.'"
      - "She looked at him, her expression softening just a fraction. 'You did good, Finn. You held your ground. That's more than most can say.'"
    
    selection_rationale: "This CHARACTER moment is the emotional heart of the chapter—the mentor and the student processing shared trauma and exchanging philosophy. Veyra's face softening 'just a fraction' is the visual key, and the composition (two figures apart from the camp fires) reinforces the intimacy."

    narrative_beat: "Marcus stands alone near the road, bathed in the faint, pulsating light of a sending stone as he finishes a message. Veyra approaches. He explains: 'The physical fight is over. Now comes the political one... it's a different kind of war, and it's the one I fight.' They stand together under the stars, two commanders of two different kinds of war."
    subtext: "The chapter transitions from aftermath to preparation. Marcus's sending stone—pulsing with magical light—is a beacon signaling the battles to come. The camp behind them is 'a small constellation of lights in a vast darkness,' a temporary home on the road to an uncertain future."

    source_excerpts:
      - "Later, as the camp settled into a low murmur, Veyra saw a lone figure near the road, bathed in the faint, pulsating light of a sending stone. Marcus."
      - "'The next battlefield,' he corrected, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. 'The physical fight is over, Veyra. Now comes the political one. The Lords' Committee will be sharpening their knives. Budgets, jurisdictions, formal complaints from Grimsby... it's a different kind of war, and it's the one I fight.'"
      - "They stood in silence for a moment, the two commanders of two different kinds of war, watching the stars emerge."
      - "The camp was a small constellation of lights in a vast darkness, a temporary home on the long road to somewhere else."
    
    selection_rationale: "This SYMBOL moment closes the chapter's visual arc with forward-looking imagery. The sending stone's magical light is visually unique and specific to this story, while the composition of two different warriors facing the darkness together captures the chapter's transition from 'what we survived' to 'what comes next.'"
