      Veyra stands small and alone in the center of the ruined courtyard, her
      arm in a sling, her scarred face turned toward the damage. The gate hangs
      from a single hinge at an unnatural angle—like a broken jaw. The eastern
      wall gapes, a jagged wound of splintered timber and fractured stone. The
      northern tower leans dangerously. Cold morning light illuminates everything
      with merciless clarity. Wet ash covers the ground, personal effects scattered
      in the rubble. She sees not just destruction but ghosts—the memory of what
      they built here.

      stands behind the bar, both massive hands flat on the wood, rag set
      aside with deliberate slowness. Her face conveys bone-deep weariness
      as she takes in the scene: Thorne road-dust covered in the doorway,
      and through the door behind him, the unmistakable forms of forty
      cavalrymen. "For fuck's sake." Perfect hospitality in its rawest form.
