      Pre-dawn warehouse, lamplight casting long shadows across the Briefing Circle.
      Marcus Heartbridge and Veyra Thornwake face each other across documents spread
      on the table—charcoal rubbings, stolen manifests, the evidence of horror.
      Marcus's usually composed face shows cracks, his voice barely a whisper,
      eyes holding genuine warning. Veyra stands opposite, burn scar catching
      lamplight, dark eyes burning with fierce determination. Her posture is
      straight despite exhaustion, jaw set. Between them, the damning evidence
      of children trafficked and imprisoned. The weight of war declared hangs
      in the air between two people who understand exactly what it means.

      Wide cinematic framing emphasizing the space between them. Documents as
      visual anchor at center-bottom. Marcus on left third, Veyra on right third.

    visual_description: |
      Lady Blackwater's office, the morning briefing concluded. Lady Moira
      wears a thin, knowing smile as she speaks of the Bastion Key—"A symbol
      of the city's trust." Across from her, Veyra's hand unconsciously
      moves to the ring at her neck—Lysander's ring, the symbol of who she
      fights for. Morning sunlight catches both women in its glow, one offering
      official recognition, the other remembering personal sacrifice.
      Two symbols, two kinds of trust.

      Two-shot with Lady Blackwater and Veyra. Lady Blackwater's thin smile
      as focal point. Veyra's hand at her neck, touching the ring. Morning
      light from window behind creating halo effect. Symbolic resonance
      between official and personal.
