    \ practical tails. The color is a natural gradient, shifting from deep sea-green\
    \ at the roots to a pale, sea-foam white at the tips. She binds these braids with\
    \ tarnished copper wire that has developed a verdigris patina from constant water\
    \ exposure, and adorns them with weathered wooden beads carved with the names\
    \ of significant waters.\n\nHer eyes are the soft, clouded gray of rain about\
    \ to fall. The color shifts with weather and mood\u2014slate before storms, silver\
    \ in sunlight. In the right light, the irises seem to contain moving clouds, as\
    \ if reflecting a sky that isn't there. When she is in deep communion with her\
    \ element, her eyes flood entirely with gray, an unnerving effect that marks her\
    \ focus. - **Height/Build**: Average height, with a lean, athletic build that\
    \ suggests disciplined training. Moves with a fluid, almost weightless grace.\n\
    - **Skin**: Deep plum-colored skin with a subtle shimmer that catches light in\
    \ certain angles, giving her an almost ethereal quality.\n- **Hair**: Surprisingly\
    \ long auburn hair, typically kept in a tight, severe bun secured with an ornate\
    \ hairpin that doubles as a concealed blade. The rich color provides striking\
    \ contrast against her plum skin.\n- **Horns**: Elegant curved horns sweep back\
    \ from her temples, filed to smooth points. They're relatively short and unobtrusive,\
    \ adding to rather than detracting from her refined appearance.\n- **Eyes**: Golden\
    \ eyes that seem to notice everything, sharp and intelligent with an almost predatory\
    \ awareness. They have a calculating quality that can shift from warm to cold\
    \ in an instant.\n- **Distinguishing Features**: Her tiefling heritage is unmistakable\
    \ but refined. When using her voice mimicry powers, faint flowing wisps of darker\
    \ purple or shadow manifest around her neck and throat, like visible sound waves\
    \ or smoke dancing across her skin. Despite her distinctive appearance, she has\
    \ an uncanny ability to make herself forgettable when needed.\n- **Typical Clothing**:\
    \ High-quality, practical clothing that allows for freedom of movement but doesn't\
    \ scream \"operative.\" Think tailored leather jackets, dark trousers, and soft-soled\
    \ boots. Always has hidden pockets. Her clothing choices often complement her\
    \ coloring with deep purples, blacks, and occasional burgundy accents.\n- **Body\
    \ Language**: Composed and confident. Her posture changes with her persona\u2014\
    from a flirtatious noble to a deferential servant. Her default state is one of\
    \ relaxed alertness.\n- **Physical Condition**: Peak physical condition, a result\
    \ of rigorous Academy training.\n\nLyra Kestrel is a tiefling with deep plum-colored\

    \ and sturdy even by dwarven standards\n- **Hair**: Iron-gray with copper streaks,\
    \ braided in traditional style\n- **Eyes**: Deep amber, sharp as a master chef's\
    \ knife\n- **Distinguishing Features**: Flour dusting her apron, faint burn scars\
    \ on forearms from decades of cooking\n- **Typical Clothing**: Practical dress\
    \ and a well-worn apron.\n- **Body Language**: No-nonsense, hands often on hips.\n\
    - **Physical Condition**: Strong from a lifetime of physical work.\n\nMistress\
    \ Elba is a dwarven grandmother with a sturdy, broad-shouldered build. Her iron-gray\
    \ hair, streaked with copper, is kept in traditional braids. She has sharp, deep\
    \ amber eyes and a no-nonsense expression. She is almost always seen in a practical\
    \ dress and a well-worn, flour-dusted apron, with faint burn scars on her forearms.\
    \ Rill Vossari is a water genasi with pale, translucent blue-green skin that has\
    \ visible turquoise currents moving beneath it. She has a strong, athletic swimmer's\
    \ build. Her most striking feature is her hair, which is styled in thick, rope-like\
    \ dreadlocks that fade from deep sea-green at the roots to a pale sea-foam white\
    \ at the tips, bound with tarnished copper wire. Her eyes are the soft, clouded\
    \ gray of rain about to fall. She typically wears a weighted oilskin longcoat\
    \ over practical sailor's clothing.\n\n\nRill Vossari's appearance immediately\
    \ marks her as water-touched. Her skin has the quality of sea-glass\u2014a pale,\
    \ translucent blue-green that seems to shift in depth depending on the light.\
    \ In shadow or moonlight, observers can see darker turquoise currents moving beneath\
    \ her skin, swirling gently on her cheeks, jawline, and throat. When she's actively\
    \ working with water, these currents quicken into mesmerizing patterns that flow\
    \ toward her hands.\n\nStanding at five feet ten inches with a strong, athletic\
    \ swimmer's build, Rill has a solid, grounded posture. Her shoulders are broad\
    \ from years of rope work, her arms corded with lean muscle. Her hands are a worker's\u2014\
    callused and scarred from dock work, yet they move with a fluid, hypnotic grace.\
    \ Her expression is often one of calm, patient focus, but can sharpen into resolute\
    \ intensity when she is observing the water or engaged in a negotiation.\n\nHer\
    \ hair is her most striking feature: thick, rope-like dreadlocks braided into\
    \ practical tails. The color is a natural gradient, shifting from deep sea-green\
    \ at the roots to a pale, sea-foam white at the tips. She binds these braids with\
    \ tarnished copper wire that has developed a verdigris patina from constant water\
    \ exposure, and adorns them with weathered wooden beads carved with the names\
    \ of significant waters.\n\nHer eyes are the soft, clouded gray of rain about\
    \ to fall. The color shifts with weather and mood\u2014slate before storms, silver\
    \ in sunlight. In the right light, the irises seem to contain moving clouds, as\
    \ if reflecting a sky that isn't there. When she is in deep communion with her\
    \ element, her eyes flood entirely with gray, an unnerving effect that marks her\
    \ focus. - **Height/Build**: Average height, with a lean, athletic build that\
    \ suggests disciplined training. Moves with a fluid, almost weightless grace.\n\
    - **Skin**: Deep plum-colored skin with a subtle shimmer that catches light in\
    \ certain angles, giving her an almost ethereal quality.\n- **Hair**: Surprisingly\
    \ long auburn hair, typically kept in a tight, severe bun secured with an ornate\
    \ hairpin that doubles as a concealed blade. The rich color provides striking\
    \ contrast against her plum skin.\n- **Horns**: Elegant curved horns sweep back\
    \ from her temples, filed to smooth points. They're relatively short and unobtrusive,\
    \ adding to rather than detracting from her refined appearance.\n- **Eyes**: Golden\
    \ eyes that seem to notice everything, sharp and intelligent with an almost predatory\
    \ awareness. They have a calculating quality that can shift from warm to cold\
    \ in an instant.\n- **Distinguishing Features**: Her tiefling heritage is unmistakable\
    \ but refined. When using her voice mimicry powers, faint flowing wisps of darker\
    \ purple or shadow manifest around her neck and throat, like visible sound waves\
    \ or smoke dancing across her skin. Despite her distinctive appearance, she has\
    \ an uncanny ability to make herself forgettable when needed.\n- **Typical Clothing**:\
    \ High-quality, practical clothing that allows for freedom of movement but doesn't\
    \ scream \"operative.\" Think tailored leather jackets, dark trousers, and soft-soled\
    \ boots. Always has hidden pockets. Her clothing choices often complement her\
    \ coloring with deep purples, blacks, and occasional burgundy accents.\n- **Body\
    \ Language**: Composed and confident. Her posture changes with her persona\u2014\
    from a flirtatious noble to a deferential servant. Her default state is one of\
    \ relaxed alertness.\n- **Physical Condition**: Peak physical condition, a result\
    \ of rigorous Academy training.\n\nLyra Kestrel is a tiefling with deep plum-colored\
    \ skin and elegant, curved horns that sweep back from her temples. Her long auburn\
    \ hair is typically kept in a severe bun, and her golden eyes are sharp and observant.\
    \ She has a lean, athletic build and moves with a fluid grace. She wears high-quality,\
    \ practical clothing in dark colors.. Symbolic emphasis: Warmth washing away exhaustion\
    \ and trauma, circle of care as protection, home as sanctuary, love made manifest\
    \ through action."
