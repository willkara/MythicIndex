          The grand amphitheater filled to capacity—three hundred faces in tiered
          seating. Scholars, engineers, city officials, and curious nobles drawn by
          the promise of hearing from the heroes of the Great Library rescue. Academic
          robes contrast with the Company's practical clothing and weathered gear.
          Professor Stoneforge presides from the front row. Diffused scholarly light
          from above, dust motes visible in shafts of illumination. Polite but expectant
          applause gives way to genuine intellectual engagement as Grimjaw transforms
          from nervous craftsman to commanding teacher.

          Mistress Elba bustles with tea trays, treating nobles like grandchildren who
          haven't eaten properly. Fayne sits at the central map table, now covered with
          documents instead of tactical planning materials, looking dazed by the flood
          of contract proposals. Seventeen formal visitors with carriages. Stacks of
          ornate documents. Warm afternoon warehouse light. The contrast between their

          table—information about Korrath, the Silent Hand facility, their moral dilemma.
          Lantern light casts warm pools, faces partially illuminated. The weight of
          success pressing down as they contemplate the next step. Marcus speaks quietly
          of darker attention their capabilities have attracted. Veyra reaffirms their
          mission at the window, Lysander's ring warm against her chest.

      Grimjaw Ironbeard stands at a podium in the grand amphitheater of the Spire of
      Learning. Three hundred faces fill the tiered seating behind him, a sea of
      scholarly robes and curious nobles. He has just straightened his shoulders—
      the moment of transformation visible in his posture. His hand has released the
      brass compass in his vest pocket. His weathered face shows the shift from
      nervousness to purpose, keen eyes now focused with newfound confidence.
      Iron-gray beard braided with metal charms catches the diffused amphitheater light.
      Before him, architectural diagrams and engineering sketches are spread on the podium.
      Professor Stoneforge leans forward in the front row with visible interest.

      A rock gnome woman with copper-red hair and blue streak sits at a wooden table
      covered with architectural drawings, face animated with enthusiasm, prosthetic
      brass arm gesturing as she speaks. Across from her, a half-elf woman with burn
      scar on her face and dark mohawk listens with carefully neutral expression,
      dark eyes studying the gnome's open, honest face. Warm afternoon light through
      windows. The contrast between innocent passion and watchful assessment.
      Fantasy warehouse interior with domestic warmth masking complexity.

      Evening in the briefing circle. Marcus Heartbridge speaks quietly, his well-
      tailored doublet catching the last light from tall windows. His expression is
      carefully neutral—a diplomat's mask that itself conveys warning. Veyra stands
      nearby, partially silhouetted against the window, listening. Intelligence
      documents spread on the central table. The city lights are beginning to appear
      beyond the glass, but shadows are deepening inside. Marcus's words hang heavy:
      "flexible definitions of what constitutes a rescue mission."
