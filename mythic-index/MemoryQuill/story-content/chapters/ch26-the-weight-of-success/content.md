The grand amphitheater of the Spire of Learning had not seen such a crowd since the infamous "Great Divination Debate" of the previous year. Every seat was filled with scholars, engineers, city officials, and curious nobles, all drawn by the promise of hearing directly from the heroes of the Great Library rescue.

As the heavy doors swung open, conversation died to whispers and then to expectant silence. The Last Light Company entered together—Veyra and Thorne flanking Grimjaw like an honor guard, Marcus and Aldwin following close behind. The sight of them drew immediate attention: practical clothing and weathered gear among the academic robes, working hands that had pulled people from rubble walking among those who worked primarily with quills and parchment.

Professor Stoneforge rose from her front-row seat, her voice carrying clearly through the vast space. "Esteemed colleagues, students, and honored guests," she announced, "it is my distinct privilege to introduce Master Grimjaw Ironbeard of the Last Light Company. His practical expertise in structural engineering and crisis response has already saved numerous lives, and today he generously shares that knowledge with us."

The applause was polite but expectant. Three hundred faces turned toward the small stage, waiting.

Grimjaw felt his throat tighten as he looked out at the sea of scholarly faces. His hand found the brass compass in his vest pocket—Jorik's gift—and drew comfort from its solid weight. Behind him, he sensed rather than saw his chosen family taking their seats in the front row. Veyra's presence was steady as stone, Thorne's confidence unwavering, Aldwin's gentle encouragement like a warm hand on his shoulder.

He approached the podium slowly, setting down his collection of architectural diagrams and engineering sketches with deliberate care. The formal shirt felt strange after months of work clothes, but the papers before him were familiar territory—problems solved, lives saved, knowledge hard-won through decades of experience.

As he looked out at the waiting audience, something shifted in his chest. These weren't judges waiting to find him wanting. They were scholars eager to learn, minds hungry for the practical wisdom he'd spent fifty years accumulating. The nervousness didn't disappear, but it transformed into something else—purpose.

Grimjaw Ironbeard straightened his shoulders and found his voice.

"Engineering," he began, his gravelly voice carrying clearly through the amphitheater, "is not about knowing all the answers. It's about asking the right questions when everything is falling apart."

Professor Aldara Stoneforge, seated in the front row, leaned forward with visible interest. Behind her, Master Cordelia Brightwater took careful notes, her decades of magical theory apparently finding common ground with practical structural analysis.

"Two days ago," Grimjaw continued, pulling up a detailed sketch of the library collapse, "we faced a problem that conventional approaches would have made worse. A standard debris clearance would have triggered additional collapses. A magical approach might have destabilized the remaining structure." He pointed to a specific section of the diagram. "Instead, we had to think like the building itself."

A young scholar raised her hand. "Master Ironbeard, what do you mean by 'thinking like the building'?"

Grimjaw's weathered face broke into what might have been a smile. "Every structure has a conversation with the forces trying to destroy it—gravity, pressure, time, catastrophe. Most of the time, we don't listen to that conversation. We impose our solutions instead of finding what the building wants to do."

He moved to a second diagram, showing the keystone removal that had opened their path. "This debris pile was in equilibrium—chaotic equilibrium, but equilibrium nonetheless. Instead of fighting that balance, we found the single point where a small change would create a controlled reorganization."

"The keystone principle," Professor Stoneforge said approvingly.

"Aye, but not just structural. The same principle applies to any complex system under stress." Grimjaw's eyes swept across the audience, taking in city officials and military officers alongside the academics. "Organizations, teams, crisis situations—they all have pressure points where minimal force creates maximum beneficial change."

From the back of the hall, Veyra watched with quiet pride as Grimjaw commanded the room's attention. She'd known he was brilliant, but seeing him articulate that brilliance for others was a revelation. Beside her, Thorne looked equally impressed.

"Questions?" Grimjaw asked, and was immediately overwhelmed by raised hands.

For the next hour, he fielded inquiries about everything from mathematical load calculations to philosophical approaches to problem-solving. His answers revealed not just technical expertise, but a deep understanding of how theoretical knowledge translated to practical application under pressure.

"Master Ironbeard," called a well-dressed man Veyra recognized as Lord Aldric Thann from the previous evening's dinner parties. "Your Company's success has been... remarkable. Are you accepting private contracts?"

The question created a subtle shift in the room's energy. Academic discussion was giving way to commercial opportunity.

Grimjaw glanced toward Veyra, who stepped forward slightly. "The Last Light Company's mission is rescue and recovery," she said diplomatically. "While we understand that resources are necessary to maintain our operations and equipment, we prioritize assignments based on urgency and need. Those trapped in a collapsed mine will always take precedence over retrieving a family heirloom, regardless of the compensation offered."

"But surely you're not refusing profitable work?" Lord Thann persisted. "An organization with your capabilities could command significant fees for specialized services."

"Our capabilities," Thorne said, joining the conversation, "were developed for saving lives, not maximizing profit."

Master Brightwater stood, her aged voice carrying the authority of decades. "Perhaps we might return to the technical discussion? Master Ironbeard, I'm curious about your methods for assessing structural integrity in chaotic environments."

The academic redirected the conversation, but the damage was done. Veyra noticed the knowing looks exchanged between several nobles in the audience, the way conversations resumed in hushed tones that spoke of opportunity rather than knowledge.

Success, it seemed, came with complications they hadn't anticipated.

They returned to the warehouse complex to find it buzzing with unusual activity. Finn met them at the main entrance, his young face bright with excitement and overwhelm.

"Commander," he said breathlessly, "we've had seventeen visitors today. Formal ones, with carriages and everything. Mistress Elba's been serving tea to nobles all afternoon—you should see her, treating them all like they're her grandchildren who haven't eaten properly in weeks!"

Inside The Mess, the usual communal dining area had been transformed into an impromptu reception room. Mistress Elba moved between small groups with practiced hospitality, her dwarven stature somehow commanding even more respect as she bustled around with tea trays, clearly in her element hosting guests. Her voice could be heard occasionally offering gentle scolding: "Now, Lord Pemberton, when did you last eat? You're all skin and bones!" Fayne sat at the central map table, now covered with documents instead of tactical planning materials, looking somewhat dazed.

"What's all this?" Veyra asked.

"Contract proposals," Marcus replied, appearing from behind a stack of papers. "They started arriving by messenger hawk and runner less than an hour after the lecture concluded. It seems Lord Thann wasn't the only one who saw a business opportunity."

Fayne held up a particularly ornate document. "Lord Ravenshollow wants us to recover a family heirloom from his brother's estate. Apparently the brother is refusing to return it, and Lord Ravenshollow believes a 'dramatic rescue' would resolve the property dispute."

"That's not a rescue," Thorne observed. "That's theft with extra steps."

"Lady Cordelia Blackmere," Fayne continued, "wants us to infiltrate her daughter's finishing school to retrieve evidence of 'inappropriate romantic correspondence.' She's prepared to pay handsomely for discretion."

Grimjaw snorted. "Spying on children. What's next, rescuing someone's favorite cat from a tree?"

"Actually," Fayne said, consulting another document, "Master Therin Goldweave's cat is stuck in his workshop's rafters, and he's offering three hundred gold for its safe recovery."

The room fell quiet for a moment.

"Three hundred gold for a cat?" Aldwin asked.

"It's apparently a very special cat," Marcus replied. "Allegedly it can detect magical forgeries in precious metals. Given Master Goldweave's business, I suspect the cat might actually be worth the fee."

Veyra rubbed her temples, feeling the weight of unexpected success. "What about legitimate requests?"

"Several," Fayne acknowledged, setting aside the frivolous contracts. "A grain merchant in the Trade Ward believes his workers are trapped in a collapsed storage facility. A ship captain claims his crew is being held against their will by a rival trading company. And..." She paused, holding up a simpler document. "A halfling grandmother from Dock Ward says her grandson joined a religious cult and she wants us to 'rescue him from their influence.'"

"Mixed bag," Thorne observed.

"The problem," Marcus said thoughtfully, "is that our success has created a perception problem. People see us as miracle workers rather than specialists. They assume we can solve any problem that involves getting someone out of somewhere."

Their discussion was interrupted by a knock at the main warehouse entrance. Finn hurried to answer it, returning with a familiar figure in practical work clothes carrying a leather satchel.

"Cidrella!" Aldwin called out warmly. "Perfect timing. We could use some sanity in all this chaos."

Cid looked around the busy space with professional interest. "Busier than usual," she observed with a slight smile. "I heard about your library rescue. Impressive work." She set her satchel on a clear section of the map table. "I brought some revised optimization plans for the storage areas, but I can see you might need efficiency improvements in other areas too."

As she spread out architectural drawings, she continued conversationally, "My partner's been fascinated by the reports. Korrath's always interested in structural engineering under extreme conditions. He said your approach to the debris clearance was textbook but innovative—exactly the kind of problem he loves working on."

Veyra and Marcus exchanged subtle glances. The opening they'd been hoping for had just presented itself.

"Your partner is an engineer?" Veyra asked casually.

"Oh yes, brilliant one too. Bronze dragonborn, third-generation military family. He's designed water management systems for half the estates around Waterdeep." Cid's pride in her partner was clear and genuine. "Actually, he's working on a fascinating project right now—a complex retrofit that's pushing the boundaries of arcane-technical integration. Environmental purity applications with incredibly demanding specifications."

The description sent cold understanding through both Veyra and Marcus. The Silent Hand facility.

"Sounds complex," Marcus said carefully.

"It is, but that's what makes it interesting. The original infrastructure was purely aesthetic—fountains, ornamental streams, that sort of thing. But the new requirements need precision environmental control and systematic purity maintenance. Very sophisticated technical challenges." Cid pulled out one of her optimization sketches. "Korrath loves projects that require genuine innovation rather than just standard solutions."

"It's funny," she continued with a fond smile, "everyone knows him by that ridiculous 'Wallbreaker' nickname because of his family's history. And it's true, his military training means he can tell you exactly how any fortress will fail. But that's *why* his real passion is creation. Understanding why things break is how you learn to build things that endure."

She leaned forward, her enthusiasm infectious. "He's a true architect at heart. He believes the most beautiful design is one that achieves perfect structural integrity with the least effort—an elegance in its strength. He says any brute can stack stones, but it takes an artist to make them stand against a siege or the weight of time. He was actually excited that the client wanted to preserve the original ornamental streams, seeing it as a challenge. He's designing the new systems to be woven into the existing aesthetic, reinforcing the structure from within. He calls it 'making the bones of a building beautiful'."

As Cid continued explaining her warehouse complex improvements, Veyra found herself studying the woman's open, honest face. Here was someone whose partner—unknowingly—had provided the Silent Hand with the perfect prison for magical children. Someone whose trust and affection could be weaponized if they weren't careful.

The weight of their success was becoming clearer. Recognition brought opportunities, but it also brought moral complexities they'd never had to navigate before.

After Cid left, the Company gathered around the Briefing Circle for an impromptu strategy session. The casual atmosphere of earlier had given way to focused concern as the implications of their situation became clear.

"We need to be very careful here," Veyra began, her voice carrying the weight of command. "Cid trusts us completely, and she's completely innocent of any wrongdoing. If we mishandle this, we could destroy her life."

Marcus spread out the intelligence he'd gathered on Korrath across the central map table. "Korrath 'Wallbreaker' Threnx. Bronze dragonborn, age thirty-seven, graduated top of his class from the Royal Engineering Academy. His family has three generations of military service, specializing in siege engineering and defensive fortifications. His nickname comes from his expertise in analyzing structural weaknesses—ironically, he's better at bringing down fortifications than building them."

"Perfect for prison breaks," Vera observed, having been following the conversation intently.

"Exactly. But here's the concerning part—his current project matches exactly what we know about the Silent Hand facility. Water temperature control, mineral filtration, and according to Cid, the client has been very specific about 'containment applications.'"

Grimjaw studied the architectural sketches Marcus had acquired. "These modifications would work perfectly for magical suppression. Temperature regulation to prevent fire magic, mineral filters to disrupt earth magic, precise flow control to counter water magic. Whoever commissioned this knew exactly what they wanted."

"The question," Aldwin said gently, "is whether Korrath knows what his work is really being used for."

"Based on Cid's description, I doubt it," Marcus replied. "She mentioned 'specialized agricultural work' as the cover story. If he's been told this is for growing magical plants or some similar legitimate purpose, he might have no idea he's designing a prison."

Thorne leaned back in his chair, his strategic mind working through the implications. "So we have an expert who could help us understand the facility's defenses and find weaknesses, but approaching him directly could expose both him and Cid to danger from the Silent Hand."

"And there's the timeline pressure," Vera added. "If Rill's observations are correct, they're accelerating their operations. We can't spend weeks on delicate relationship building."

"All true," Thorne said, his voice firm but laced with reluctance. "And let's be clear: the only reason we're even having this conversation is because we have credible intelligence that children are at risk." He looked around the table, his gaze lingering on each member. "If this were just about disrupting a smuggling ring, I'd say it's a matter for the Watch. But this... this is a rescue. It just happens to be one that requires us to act more like spies than engineers."

"He's right," Aldwin said quietly, his hands steepled before him. "Our purpose has always been to answer the call of those in peril. The nature of the peril has changed, but the call is the same. We cannot turn away when we know children are suffering."

Thorne nodded, accepting the healer's point. "Which means we have to be smart. This isn't a collapsed mine or a tenement fire. This is a planned operation against a fortified, clandestine facility. We'd be going in blind, and without a legal mandate."

Grimjaw grunted in agreement. "Aye. I can tell you how a building will fall, not how many guards are behind the next door or what magical traps they've laid. This isn't about structural failure; it's about active, hostile opposition. It's a different kind of problem entirely."

"From a legal standpoint, if we're caught on that property without official sanction, we're not rescuers; we're armed intruders," Marcus added coolly. "The Silent Hand would have every right to 'defend' themselves, and we'd have no recourse. We would lose every bit of political capital we've just earned."

Veyra stood and moved to the tall windows of the main warehouse, listening as her team articulated the very conclusion she had reached. They were walking a new path, but their compass was unchanged. The city's lights sparkled like stars, each one representing lives and families that depended on organizations like theirs to stand between them and the darkness—and to do so wisely.

"We need official backing," she said finally. "This is beyond what we can handle as an independent operation. We need to brief Lady Blackwater, explain the situation, and request formal authorization for a reconnaissance mission."

"That means revealing our connection to Cid and Korrath," Marcus pointed out. "Government involvement could complicate our ability to protect them."

"But it also provides resources we can't access on our own," Thorne countered. "Professional surveillance, backup operations, extraction protocols if things go wrong."

Grimjaw cracked his knuckles thoughtfully. "What kind of timeline are we looking at for reconnaissance?"

"Days, not weeks," Vera said firmly. "If they're moving captives according to the schedule we suspect, every day we delay costs lives."

The room fell quiet as they contemplated the weight of their decision. Success had brought them to this point—recognition, resources, and the trust of a city that believed they could accomplish the impossible. But it had also brought them face-to-face with the reality that some problems couldn't be solved by pure competence and good intentions.

"Set up the meeting with Lady Blackwater," Veyra decided. "Tomorrow morning, if possible. We'll present our intelligence, explain the complications with Korrath and Cid, and request a formal reconnaissance authorization."

As the team began to disperse for the evening, heading to their mezzanine level quarters and private spaces, Marcus lingered behind. "Veyra," he said quietly, "there's something else you should know. Three different intelligence services have made informal inquiries about our availability for 'specialized projects.' Word is spreading beyond Waterdeep about our capabilities."

"What kind of projects?"

"The kind that require deniability and specialized skills. The kind that blur the line between rescue and assassination." His expression was carefully neutral. "Success in our line of work tends to attract attention from people who have... flexible definitions of what constitutes a rescue mission."

Veyra nodded grimly, her gaze fixed on the city lights. "So it's not just recovering cats and settling property disputes. Now it's this."

"To them, the principle is the same," Marcus said, his voice low and devoid of judgment. "They see a tool that can retrieve valuable assets from difficult situations. They don't differentiate between a person and an object, or a rescue and a 'recovery'."

"But we do," Veyra stated, her voice hardening as she turned from the window to face him. "That is the entire point of what we are. We are not mercenaries for asset recovery between political rivals." She met his eyes, her own reflecting the lantern's flame. "Our mission stands. 'No one left behind' means *no one*. Not 'no one unless it's politically convenient,' and certainly not 'no asset left behind'."

"I never doubted it," Marcus replied. "But we should be prepared for those offers to become more persistent. And more lucrative."

As night settled over Waterdeep and the warehouse complex grew quiet, Veyra stood again at the tall windows, Lysander's ring warm against her chest. Two days ago they'd been specialists trying to prove themselves worthy of recognition. Now they were recognized specialists trying to prove they were worthy of their success.

The weight of that success was heavier than she'd expected. But tomorrow would bring the next step in their most important mission yet. Children were counting on them, even if those children didn't know the Last Light Company existed.

That thought, more than any amount of noble recognition or political pressure, would guide them through whatever came next.
