      CHAPTER 33 VARIATIONS (THE SHATTERING):
      - SCENE 02 (Pre-revelation): Bubbly, bouncing on feet, copper-red hair escaping braids, blue streak prominent. Goggles on forehead. Enthusiastic, bright brown eyes. Prosthetic arm at rest, conduits with normal blue glow.
      - SCENE 03 (The Blow): Frozen rigid. Power pack whining. Conduits flaring blue-white. Static building, hair lifting.
      - SCENE 03 (Horror Dawning): Prosthetic hand to mouth. Wet eyes. Engineer's mind racing. Conduits flickering erratically.
      - SCENE 03 (The Explosion): Prosthetic slamming down. Oak exploding. Blue-white flash at impact. Splinters flying. Small fires starting. Hair fully lifted by static.

      Medium two-shot in Cid's chaotic workshop. Grimjaw stands firm, weathered hands at his sides, delivering the killing truth with his gravelly voice. His iron-gray beard catches the workshop light, metal charms glinting. His expression is that of someone who knows mercy sometimes requires an axe.
      Across from him, Cid has frozen mid-motion. Her entire body rigid. The copper-red hair is beginning to lift from static charge. Her power pack, visible at her back, emits a high-pitched whine. The arcane conduits in her prosthetic arm flare from normal blue to brilliant blue-white, casting harsh shadows. Unit 7 in the background is frozen mid-pour, responding to its creator's distress.
    composition_notes: |
      Grimjaw positioned left, solid as stone. Cid positioned right, caught in the moment of impact. The chaotic workshop between and around them suddenly feels ominous. Eye moves from Grimjaw's steady presence to Cid's electrified stillness.

      Cid is caught in the pose of full downward strike, her small frame channeling all her augmented strength and anguish. Her copper-red hair streams upward from the force and static. Her face is a mask of grief-rage, tears and fury combined. Small fires are starting where arcane sparks meet oil-soaked rags.

      Draconic heritage manifested in rage. The controlled, terrible justice of bronze—not explosive fury but measured wrath. Lightning arcing across scales like living veins of light. Supernatural power restrained by will.

      Korrath stands in his cathedral of precision, but the order he built is disrupted by the storm he contains. Small bolts of lightning arc across his burnished bronze scales, tracing his features like living veins of light. The scar across his left eye is illuminated by electrical discharge. His family crest on its bronze chain catches the lightning, the three interlocked gears seeming to glow.
      The precision tools on their pegboards vibrate against their hooks. The lights in the workshop flicker. The air itself seems charged, metallic taste and ozone sting. His massive hands rest on the drafting table, and where his fingers touch, the paper is singed at the edges.
      His expression is not rage but something more terrible: the controlled justice of his draconic heritage, patience weaponized.
    composition_notes: |
      Ultra-wide cinematic framing with Korrath dominating the center. The precision workshop around him provides contrast—order disrupted by contained chaos. Lightning traces create visual movement across his still form. The flickering lights and vibrating tools suggest barely-restrained power.

      Ultra-wide shot of a precision engineering workshop, every surface meticulously organized.
      A tall, broad bronze dragonborn stands at a heavy oak drafting table. Small bolts of lightning arc across his burnished bronze scales, tracing his features like living veins of light. The deep scar across his left eye is illuminated by electrical discharge.
      His family engineering crest—three interlocked gears beneath a hammer—glows on a bronze chain at his chest.
      Precision tools on pegboards vibrate against their hooks. Lights flicker. Where his massive hands rest on blueprints, the paper singes at the edges.
      His expression is not explosive rage but controlled, terrible justice—the heritage of bronze dragonborn fully manifested.
      Cinematic ultra-wide framing, draconic power barely contained, ozone sharp in the air.

      Close-medium shot focused on Korrath's chest and face. The family engineering crest hangs on its bronze chain—three interlocked gears beneath a hammer, catching and channeling the lightning that plays across his scales. The crest seems to glow from within, ancestral honor responding to ancestral rage.
      His bronze scales are bright with electrical discharge, the burnished surface reflecting the arcs. His jaw is set, sparks playing between his teeth as he speaks words that carry thunder resonance. The scar across his left eye is a dark river in the electrical storm of his face.
      Behind him, out of focus, the perfect order of his workshop—a life's work of precision now associated with a prison.
    composition_notes: |
      Tight framing with crest as anchor point, face as emotional focus. Lightning creates dynamic movement within a still pose. The out-of-focus workshop behind establishes context without distraction. The crest and scar create dual focal points of honor and pain.

      Two-shot of Grimjaw and Korrath in the engineering workshop. Grimjaw stands close, weathered hands visible—decades of forge work and stone dust marking them, scars from similar guilt carried. His iron-gray beard catches the fading lightning, metal charms glinting. His expression holds bone-deep understanding: he has been here before.
      Korrath's lightning is dimming, the arcs across his scales retreating not from exhaustion but from something like resolution. His massive form remains still, but the tension is draining. His gaze meets Grimjaw's—builder to builder, the understanding that needs no words.
      The precision workshop around them is settling, tools no longer vibrating, lights steadying.
    composition_notes: |
      Two-shot with equal weight to both figures. Grimjaw slightly lower due to height, but positioned with visual authority. The fading lightning creates transitional lighting—dangerous into hopeful. Eye contact between them is the emotional anchor.

      War room at Dock Ward HQ. Cid is bent over parchment, charcoal flying across the surface as she sketches furiously. Her prosthetic arm's conduits pulse with creative energy—blue-white but controlled now, focused. Her copper-red hair is wild, goggles pushed up on her forehead. The fierce, humorless smile on her freckled face speaks of revenge through brilliance.
      Around her, the team watches: Rill's calm presence providing steady anchor, her sea-glass hand resting near the sketches as she offers to prime the device. Blueprints and maps spread across the table. The atmosphere is purpose transformed—grief channeled into solution.
      "We'll ring it like a bell" hangs in the air—the Bellringer named, the countermeasure conceived.
    composition_notes: |
      Cid positioned center-left, bent over her work. The sketch in progress visible but abstracted—the genius in motion rather than the result. Rill positioned right, providing calm counterpoint. Team members suggested in background. Energy flows from Cid's creation into the room.
