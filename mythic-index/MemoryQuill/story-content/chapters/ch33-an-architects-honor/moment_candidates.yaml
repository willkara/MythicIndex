    source_excerpts:
      - "Rill Vossari rested her hand on the schematics, closing her eyes for a moment. 'The water they're using feels... wrong,' she said, her voice quiet but clear. 'It's heavy, sullen. Like it's been put to sleep and is having a cold dream.'"
      - "As Cid's furious creative energy filled the space, Rill reached over and briefly placed her other hand on the gnome's arm—a quiet, steadying gesture of solidarity."
      - "'I can prime it with a binding of rain-song and copper,' she said, her voice a calm counterpoint to Cid's fire. 'Your resonance will ride the water farther and take hold faster.'"
    
    selection_rationale: "This MOOD moment provides visual resolution—moving from destruction to construction, from isolation to connection. The contrast between Rill's aquamarine skin and Cid's brass prosthetic creates a striking image of elemental partnership."
