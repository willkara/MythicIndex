    source_excerpts:
      - "Veyra took the highest parapet and let the city settle beneath her. The lantern in her hand cast a small circle of warmth that held the dusk at bay."
      - "'Then we handle it anyway,' she said. 'Because that's who we are now—the ones who step forward when others can't or won't.'"
      - "The lantern's flame flickered, steadied, and burned bright against the night."
    
    selection_rationale: "This HERO moment provides the chapter's visual thesis statement—the Last Light Company as literal last light against the dark. The wide shot of two silhouettes on battlements, lantern burning against gathering night, city lights below, captures scale, symbol, and emotion. The flame that 'flickered, steadied, and burned bright' is the Company's visual identity made concrete."
