          Late morning. Warm amber light through windows, coffee steam rising,
          the smell of slightly burnt bread. Communal tables worn smooth by use.
          Great hearth glowing. Rafters above where Echo perches. The room hums
          with plate-clatter and banter—the sound of a dysfunctional family
          settling into itself. Chaos and warmth intermingled.

          Afternoon. Fayne's corner resembles an overturned merchant stall.
          Stonebridge supplies—ropes, canvas, tools—stacked in precarious towers.
          Ledger pages spread among the chaos. Afternoon light through slit
          windows illuminates the organizational strain. Dust motes in the air.

        chapter_context: |
          Night. Small room—cot, table, lantern. Stonebridge documents sprawled
          like an uncharted map. The lantern is the only light source, casting
          warm gold over papers and stone walls. Intimate, still, the weight
          of midnight strategy. The lantern base grows warm over certain documents.

          Dawn and morning. Tall windows threading early light across the central
          table. The mood is tauter than usual—focus where warmth often sits.
          Lantern at center warming the documents. Later: ledger pages spread,
          Vera and Fayne bent over patterns. Echo alert on table edge.
          Window showing tree-line where watchers lurk.

          Evening. Highest point of the watchpost. City lights kindling below
          as afternoon slides toward night. Northern road dark with possibility.
          Sunset gold fading. The lantern in Veyra's hand casts a small circle
          of warmth against the gathering dusk. Resolute, quiet, the weight
          of expanding mission.

    visual_description: |
      Wide shot from behind and slightly below Veyra and Thorne on the highest parapet of
      Westwall Watchpost. They stand side by side, looking out over the city. Waterdeep
      stretches below them, windows kindling with evening light like scattered stars.
      The sky holds the last gold of sunset fading to deep blue. Veyra holds her lantern
      at her side, its flame steady against the gathering dark. The northern road is a
      dark ribbon disappearing into shadow. Their silhouettes are resolute—shoulders back,
      facing whatever comes.
    composition_notes: |
      Ultra-wide aspect emphasizes the scope of their responsibility. Figures placed
      left of center, city spreading right. Horizon line low, emphasizing vast sky
      and the weight of dusk. Lantern flame is a warm anchor in the cooling palette.

      Medium shot focused on Echo and Vera. The raven's head has snapped toward
