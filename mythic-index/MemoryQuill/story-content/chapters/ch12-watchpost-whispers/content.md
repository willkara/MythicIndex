Late morning in the Westwall Watchpost mess hall smelled of fresh coffee and slightly burnt bread, the kind of breakfast Mistress Elba swore tasted better than it looked. The Company had only just returned from Stonebridge, but the room already hummed with the old rhythms of camaraderie. Grimjaw, mid-mouthful and unbothered by decorum, boomed above the clatter, "And then the little runt, Thomas, he goes, 'Ma! Not in front of—ow, ow, ow!'" He mimed the boy's flailing with dwarven gusto, and laughter burst around the table.

"I swear, Commander," Venn wheezed, wiping at the tears in his eyes, "your laugh that day nearly melted the snow. Never thought I'd see it."

Veyra's smile was small and unguarded. "It was... unexpected. Like finding a blizzard in July."

"A reminder," Aldwin said gently, warmth settling into his voice, "that even in the gravest situations, there's room for absurdity. And young love."

"Still," Halden muttered, though the complaint was fond, "a full winter rescue for a boy and his sweetheart. My medical supplies took a beating."

"We learned from it," Fayne replied, bright and analytical. "That deployment taught us things. Valuable things."

Mistress Elba swept in with a fresh pot and an air of ownership. "Invaluable for my pantry, you mean! You lot eat like a plague of locusts. And don't even get me started on the dwarf's 'special' tea requests."

"A dwarf needs his comforts, woman! And your coffee tastes like boiled boots," Grimjaw shot back, grinning.

Thorne leaned closer to Veyra, voice low beneath the merriment. "They're settling in. This feels... right."

On the rafters, Echo cocked his head, one beady eye fixed on the table below. Vera stroked the raven's neck and murmured, "See, Echo? Even humans can be amusing when they're not trying to freeze to death."

Without warning, Echo launched from the rafter in a blur of black feathers. He swooped low over the table, snatched a piece of bacon directly from Grimjaw's plate, and flapped back to his perch in one smooth motion. The distinctive *caw-caw-caw* that followed sounded distinctly like laughter.

"The bird's a damn thief!" Grimjaw bellowed, staring at his now bacon-less plate.

Echo fluffed his feathers, tilted his head, and made a series of soft clicking sounds while tearing into his prize.

Vera's expression remained perfectly deadpan. "He says you were eating too slowly. Inefficient resource management."

"The bird did *not* say that. The bird stole my breakfast!"

Another deliberate *caw*, almost mocking.

"He's also pointing out," Vera continued, tone clinical, "that you left it unguarded while gesturing dramatically. A clear tactical error."

Fayne laughed so hard he nearly spilled his coffee. "Does Echo critique everyone's eating habits?"

Echo's head swiveled toward Fayne. The raven made a low warbling sound, then deliberately knocked a small twig off the rafter. It landed directly in Fayne's porridge with a soft *plop*.

"He says yes," Vera translated, her lips twitching. "And that you push your vegetables to one side like a child. Though he appreciates that you give them to Finn when you think no one's watching."

Fayne flushed. "How does the bird *see* that?"

"Ravens see everything," Vera said simply. "It's their gift. And their curse."

Echo cawed again, louder this time, and made a show of pecking at the stolen bacon.

"And he wants you to know," Vera added, "that if Grimjaw didn't want his food stolen, he shouldn't leave it so conveniently accessible. Ravens have standards."

The entire table stared at the bird. Echo, clearly enjoying the attention, fluffed his feathers and clicked smugly around his mouthful of bacon.

"Your bird," Thorne said slowly, "is a bandit with feathers."

"He's a raven," Vera said, as if that explained everything. "They're intelligent, opportunistic, and have excellent memory. Cross him once, he'll remember for years."

Echo cawed in what sounded like agreement, then deliberately dropped a small piece of bacon. It landed with perfect precision in Mistress Elba's coffee.

The mess hall exploded in laughter.

Plate-clatter and banter rose to fill the room—the sound of a slightly dysfunctional, deeply bonded family growing into itself.

By midday, laughter thinned as duty pulled everyone back to their posts.



By late afternoon, Fayne's corner of the barracks resembled a merchant's stall overturned by a gale. Stonebridge's gifts—ropes, canvas, tools—teetered in precarious stacks while the quartermaster hunched over a ledger, sketching and muttering, "Fifty feet of silk, seventy of hemp... and where in the nine hells am I going to put a new cauldron? Elba's going to have my hide."

Halden drifted past and peered over his shoulder. "Still trying to fit a dragon into a teacup, Fayne? I heard we got proper medical supplies. Any chance of a real infirmary soon? This curtained corner isn't exactly sterile."

Fayne sighed and tapped the sketches. "Working on it. Modular storage, maybe a collapsible field clinic. But it all needs space. And a proper foundation."

The rustle of parchment and scratch of quill stitched the moment together, organized chaos with a dream of order pressing at its edges.

Before he left, Fayne dog-eared a fresh ledger—irregular entries he’d circle with Vera after breakfast. The stacks loomed like makeshift walls; if the Company meant to keep growing, they’d need real ones.

When the sun dipped, talk gave way to drill.



The Westwall training yard wore early evening like a mantle; shadows stretched long while Thorne watched a knot of recruits work their forms. Tomaq's bark cracked across the yard. "Again! Faster! You move like a pregnant owlbear! Commander Thornwake wouldn't hesitate—why are you?"

Thorne paced beside him, tempering the edge. "They're adapting, Tomaq. Not everyone has our experience—or Vera's bow-hand."

"Hmph. Instincts," Tomaq muttered, though a reluctant humor tugged at his mouth. "Give me a shield wall any day. Still—the dwarf's got a way with timber. And the halfling's teas... wonders for a bruised ego after a spar."

Behind them a Watchman whispered to another, awe threading the words. "Heard the Commander can make a man's shadow fight him. Best not to cross her."

Steel rang and boots thudded. Old discipline learned the Company's newer rhythm.

As the line reset, Thorne clocked where feet bogged and ranks broke—notes for Fayne’s sketches. If they wanted speed when it mattered, they’d need space to breathe.

Night gathered where the day's noise had been.



Veyra's small room held little more than a cot, a table, and the steady comfort of her lantern. Ledgers and documents from Stonebridge sprawled across the wood like an uncharted map. As she moved the lantern to better illuminate the papers, she noticed its base grew noticeably warmer when positioned over certain documents—particularly Marcus's notes about supply routes and the patterns Vera had observed. She traced the scar on her cheek and murmured, "A lock without a key... a fortress waiting. And a city that whispers of gold and shadows."

As she adjusted the wick, her fingers brushed warm brass and something else brushed back—a distant awareness, curious rather than threatening, like old eyes measuring her from across a gulf. It was gone as quickly as it came, leaving only the faithful glow.

"Still burning the midnight oil, Commander?" Thorne asked from the doorway. "Or just keeping the light on?"

"Both," she said. "The whispers are getting louder—about the Hand, about strongholds. Marcus was right: we're becoming bigger than we thought. More visible."

"A path to a fortress," he said. "And a fight."

"A fight we're ready for. Now more than ever."

The lantern hummed softly in the quiet, and strategies began to stitch themselves together in Veyra's mind.

Dawn found them ready.



Dawn threaded through the tall windows of the main hall as the Last Light Company gathered at the central table. The mood was tauter than their usual morning banter—focus settling where warmth often sat. After a long night with the Stonebridge documents, Veyra had called them together.

"Before we decide what comes next," she said, authority coming as naturally as breath now, "those who went to Stonebridge should brief the rest."

Thorne spread the copied ledger pages like a map of poor intentions. "Silas Croft wasn't just skimming coin. He was facilitating something larger."

Veyra placed her lantern at the table's center, its light pooling over the documents. As they discussed the patterns, she noticed it seemed to grow warmer when their conversation touched on the most significant connections—the timing of disappearances, the correlation with specific supply routes.

Grimjaw's mouth thinned. "Seen this in border mining camps. People go missing from worksites—always the ones least likely to be missed quickly."

Vera leaned forward; Echo's soft caw punctuated the moment. "Missing people. Organized disappearances." The morning's earlier lightness had left her voice. "Before you found me half-frozen in the Thornwood, I was tracking a Silent Hand cell. Three families vanished from border villages. The trail led to a depot abandoned weeks before I reached it."

Fayne flicked through notes. "The ledger's coded, but the pattern is clear: regular payments to transport 'special cargo' on northern routes. Early spring, every time. Same destinations."

Vera paled and touched Echo's wing. "Early spring shipments. Northern routes." Her whisper sharpened. "That's the Silent Hand."

Silence settled. Most of them knew fragments of Vera's story—her brother, the years of pursuit—but this was the first time their Company's work braided into that hunt.

"Are you certain?" Aldwin asked softly. "Corruption and trafficking often echo one another."

Vera pushed to the window and back again. "Seven years, Aldwin. I know their patterns better than my own heartbeat." She met each gaze in turn. "When you found me, I was dying because I followed a lead too far. But with this Company—with resources and backup—for the first time in seven years I'm not hunting alone. That terrifies them more than any lone tracker ever could."

"Marcus mentioned overlapping interests," Veyra said. "Perhaps this is what he meant."

Thorne didn't sugarcoat it. "Or he's tied to them. Information brokers trade in more than knowledge."

Vera's laugh carried no mirth. "If Marcus is Hand, we've already shown them what we can do. They'll be watching."

"Let them," Grimjaw said, iron behind the words. "We've faced worse than slavers."

"Have you?" Vera asked, quiet and flensing. "The Silent Hand are ghosts. They take what they want and vanish. What they leave are empty homes and grieving families."

The weight of it moved across the table. Veyra looked at her people—each marked by loss, bound by choice.

"What do you need from us, Vera?" she asked.

The question caught the ranger off guard. "Information. Resources. The ledger gives us a start, but we need to map current operations. If they move people through Waterdeep's trade, there will be signs."

"I'll cross-reference ledger entries against manifests and guild records," Fayne said. "If there's a pattern, we'll see it."

"Healers near slaver routes always come up short on supplies," Halden added. "They need to keep people alive. I'll speak to my counterparts."

"Carefully," Veyra said. "No charges into the dark. We gather, understand the shape of it, then act." She met Vera's eyes. "Your brother has waited seven years. We won't save him by getting ourselves killed."

Vera's jaw worked, then she nodded. "Understood, Commander."

The work didn't stop when the briefing ended.



Later that morning, Vera and Fayne bent over the Stonebridge papers, their approaches oddly complementary—her instincts reading the negative space between entries, his notes weaving names into structure. Echo perched on the table's edge, tilting his head as if listening.

"Here," Vera said, tapping a column. "Payments to 'K. Threnx' for 'fortification consulting.' Same amount, early spring, every year."

Fayne flipped through his notebook. "Korrath Threnx—independent, secure architectural design. Military engineer by training. Builds for private clients."

"And here," she added, sliding a page across, "payments to 'Vexweld Enterprises' for 'security system installation.'"

Fayne frowned. "Security systems for what? The amounts are too regular. And the timing—"

"Two weeks," Vera finished, tracing the dates. "Every Vexweld payment lands exactly two weeks before a Threnx payment. Systems first, fortifications after. They aren't just moving people—they're building places to hold them."

Echo gave a sudden caw, head snapping toward the window.

Vera followed his gaze. "We're being watched. Third time today I've seen movement in those trees."

"Friendly?" Fayne asked.

"With Echo that jumpy?" She rose, hand brushing the bow at her shoulder. "Unlikely. Word travels fast. Stonebridge might've drawn the wrong eyes."

"Black Hawks?"

"Possibly. Or the Silent Hand."

Thorne appeared in the doorway. "If someone's watching, we need emergency protocols. Vera—can Echo carry messages? Others, if needed?"

"He can find specific roosts, and ravens outrun horses over rough ground," she said. "I can also call on other rangers; their companions can relay."

Thorne nodded. "Good. We'll set signal protocols in case our usual lines are cut."

By afternoon, small problems braided into one conversation.



Mistress Elba found Veyra in the main hall that afternoon, ledger clutched close and the look of a woman who had exhausted every simple fix. "Commander, I need a word about logistics," she said. "Fayne's Stonebridge haul has claimed half my storage. I'm running out of room to keep food properly. It isn't a crisis yet, but it's heading there."

Fayne drifted in on the edge of the conversation, sheepish. "I've run the numbers. We need at least twice the storage we have—and dedicated workshop space if we intend to maintain our gear properly."

As if summoned, others gathered.

"A proper infirmary would help," Halden said. "The curtain works, but it isn't ideal."

"Forge is squeezed," Grimjaw added. "Can't expand without eating the commons."

"And a secure place for intelligence work wouldn't hurt," Vera said. "The mess hall isn't private."

"All reasonable," Veyra said. "The Watchpost has served us well, but we're outgrowing it."

"It was always meant to be temporary," Thorne agreed. "We simply outpaced our plan."

"Growth—even uncomfortable growth—means we're alive," Aldwin mused.

Elba huffed. "Lovely. I still need a place to store bread."

"Fair," Veyra said. "Options?"

Fayne produced folded sketches, a spark back in his eyes. "Rough ideas: modular builds, better layout, movable partitions. Efficient over fancy."

Grimjaw studied the drawings. "Sensible. The real question's site—where do we put it?"

"Defensible and accessible," Thorne said. "Close for response, far for privacy."

"And secure from eyes," Vera added. "After what we've learned about the Hand, we can't be careless."

"We make do while we search," Veyra decided. "Growing pains, not a crisis."

The room shifted from pressure to planning.

"One step at a time," Aldwin said. "Work here while we look for something permanent. Investigate the Silent Hand methodically. And don't let perfect strangle good."

"Agreed," Veyra said. "We've managed this long; we can manage longer."

"I'll refine designs with Fayne," Grimjaw offered. "When we find the spot, we build it right."

"I'll keep eyes on our watchers," Vera added. "Better to know who's interested—and why."

As afternoon slid toward evening, Veyra took the highest parapet and let the city settle beneath her. The lantern in her hand cast a small circle of warmth that held the dusk at bay. Below, the Company's routines braided into a comfortable rhythm.

Thorne joined her as she knew he would. For a time, they watched Waterdeep kindle its lights.

"Lot to consider," he said.

"Vera's intelligence changes everything," Veyra answered. "We're not only rescuers anymore. We might be the ones positioned to hit the Silent Hand."

"And that doesn't worry you?"

"Of course it does." She traced the lantern's rim with her thumb. "But the alternative is letting them keep taking people. Letting families like Vera's stay broken."

He studied the dark line of the northern road. "I may be called back to the Watch soon. Grimsby's quiet. That usually means something's coming. If it does..."

"Then you go," she said. "It's who you are. We'll manage."

"And if this investigation pulls us beyond what a rescue company should handle?"

"Then we handle it anyway," she said. "Because that's who we are now—the ones who step forward when others can't or won't."

"The Last Light Company."

"The Last Light Company," she echoed.

Night took the Watchpost in careful stages. Somewhere in the dark, enemies arranged their pieces; somewhere else, families counted the names that hadn't come home. On the parapet of a borrowed fortress, a found family prepared for both.

The lantern's flame flickered, steadied, and burned bright against the night.
