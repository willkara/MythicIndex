This is a detailed art direction request for Chapter 3: "The First Spark". I need to:

1. Process the 6 candidate moments from the Visual Story Analyst
2. Pull canonical character visuals from the provided imagery.yaml files
3. Select appropriate moods for each image based on the decision framework
4. Ensure visual variety across the chapter
5. Output production-ready imagery.yaml

Let me analyze each moment and assign moods:

**Moment 01: Veyra cleaning lantern (ritual)**
- Narrative function: Tension before action, establishing character
- Setting: Interior barracks, evening
- Position: Opening scene
- Character state: Fragile comfort, anchoring ritual
- **Suggested Mood: INTIMATE** - This is a quiet, personal moment. The warmth of the barracks, the ritual nature, the single lantern light - all point to intimate. Soft warm amber tones, gentle shadows.

**Moment 02: Veyra ripping bandage**
- Narrative function: Pivotal choice, defiance
- Setting: Same barracks, but with fire visible through window
- Position: First pivot point
- Character state: Defiant resolve
- **Suggested Mood: SOMBER transitioning to KINETIC** - Actually, this is about defiance and agency. The split lighting suggests drama. Let me think... The moment itself is about determination, not action yet. Given the fire visible through the window and the weight of the choice, I'd say **SOMBER** with hints of coming conflict. The emotional weight, the Rembrandt-style lighting, the significance of the gesture.

**Moment 03: Burning tenement (establishing shot)**
- Narrative function: Establishing the crisis
- Setting: Dock Ward, exterior, chemical fire
- Position: Chapter's central crisis begins
- Character state: N/A - environmental
- **Suggested Mood: OMINOUS** - The white-green chemical fire is explicitly unnatural. This is "wrongness" made visual. 

The sickly palette and unnatural lighting perfectly capture the dread and impending chaos. Oily smoke and eerie chemical colors create a sense of profound unease, signaling something fundamentally wrong is about to unfold.

**Moment 04: Water hitting phosphorus (eruption)**
- Narrative function: Action climax, vindication
- Setting: Same fire scene
- Position: Proving Veyra's expertise
- Character state: Terrifying vindication
- **Suggested Mood: KINETIC** - This is pure violent action. The geyser of flame, guards thrown back, chaos. Diagonal energy, harsh contrast, fire orange, dramatic baroque drama.

**Moment 05: Building collapse**
A devastating moment of crushing defeat emerges through silent aftermath. The scene embodies helplessness - shadows deepening, action suspended, emotional weight pressing down like architectural ruins. Somber tones reflect total emotional and physical destruction, where even cries have been silenced by overwhelming collapse.

**Moment 06: Fayne's sketch**
Intimate transformation occurs through quiet creation. Warm firelight illuminates a private moment of identity formation, capturing hope emerging from destruction's ashes. The sketch becomes a tender, Vermeer-like interior scene of personal resilience and quiet rebirth.

**Mood Distribution Check:**
The chapter's emotional landscape moves with deliberate, nuanced progression. An intricate emotional arc unfolds from comfort through gravity, dread, chaos, defeat, and ultimately hope. Each moment carefully calibrates emotional intensity, creating a complex narrative rhythm that guides the reader's internal experience.

Characters span multiple scenes, with key figures like Veyra Thornwake and Thorne Brightward anchoring critical narrative moments. Supporting characters populate the chapter's periphery, some directly engaged, others referenced but not centrally present.

Location dynamics shift between intimate interior spaces and chaotic exterior environments, amplifying the emotional trajectory through physical setting transformations.

The emerging structure demands precise character placement, verbatim appearance descriptions, and meticulous mood token selection to capture the chapter's nuanced emotional architecture.
