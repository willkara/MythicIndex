The Westwall Watchpost barracks smelled of old leather, whetstone dust, and Venn's questionable stew—a combination that had somehow become comforting in its familiarity. Veyra sat at a small table apart from the main group, meticulously cleaning the glass of her lantern with a soft cloth. The ritual had become her anchor, each careful wipe a small victory against the chaos that still flickered at the edges of her vision.

Thorne's patrol had adopted her into their orbit without question or ceremony. They treated her with a careful balance of respect and normalcy—acknowledging what she'd survived without making her a monument to it. Their boisterous energy formed a protective barrier she hadn't known she needed.

"Heard a new one for you at the tavern, Veyra," Venn announced, stirring his pot with a wooden ladle that had seen better decades. "They're calling you 'The Lanternlight Lass' now. Got a nice ring to it, don't you think?"

Darric snorted from the bench where he was mending a broken strap. "I heard 'The Ash-Marked' down at the docks. More fitting, if you ask me. Has gravity to it."

"I am not a story," Veyra said quietly, not looking up from her work. The words carried weight but not heat.

"Too late for that," Kelen grunted from where he was oiling his sword. "You're already in three different drinking songs. Heard one last night that had you wrestling a dragon with your bare hands."

"Just the one dragon?" Veyra's lips twitched slightly. "I'm insulted."

Before anyone could respond, a deep, resonant *thump* echoed from the direction of the Dock Ward—heavy enough to rattle the mugs on the table and send Venn's ladle clattering to the floor. A heartbeat later, the frantic, brazen peal of fire alarm bells cut through the evening air like a blade through silk.

The transformation was instant. The comfortable soldiers became professionals in the space of a breath. Thorne was on his feet, voice crisp and commanding. "Dock Ward fire response. Standard formation, perimeter control. Move!"

His men responded without hesitation, jokes forgotten, hands already reaching for gear. But as they moved, Thorne's eyes found Veyra. She hadn't moved from her table, but her knuckles were white around the lantern's handle.

He approached her, expression firm but gentle—the look of someone who understood the weight of trauma. "Stay here. Rest. Heal. That's an order..." he paused, softening slightly, "...from a friend."

Veyra's gaze shifted from his concerned face to the window, where a column of greasy black smoke was already rising over the city rooftops. The color was wrong—too dark, with an oily sheen that spoke of alchemical acceleration. Her body recognized it before her mind did, muscles tensing with remembered heat.

Without a word, she reached up to the bandage on her forearm—the one Dokra had wrapped just that morning—and deliberately, methodically, ripped it away. The healing skin beneath was pink and raw, but whole enough.

"The canyon taught me something," she said, standing with only a slight wobble. "Some wounds don't heal by staying still. They heal by moving forward."

She grabbed her walking stick and her ever-present lantern, limping toward the door with grim determination.

Thorne watched her for a heartbeat, recognizing the futility of argument. That particular set to her jaw was immovable as mountain stone. With a short, resigned sigh that spoke volumes, he moved to the wagon and offered her a hand up.

"Try not to die," he said quietly. "Dokra will resurrect you just to kill you again."

"Noted," Veyra replied, and for a moment, she almost smiled.

The scene in the Dock Ward was organized chaos given form. A three-story tenement writhed in flames, vomiting thick, acrid smoke that made the very air seem diseased. One wall had partially collapsed, revealing the building's wooden bones like a carcass split open. The air tasted of burnt chemicals and human fear—a combination that made Veyra's scars ache with memory.

The City Watch had already arrived, doing exactly what they were trained to do: establishing order from chaos. They pushed back the gathering crowd with practiced efficiency, creating clear zones, shouting commands that had been drilled into them through years of training. They were soldiers bringing discipline to disaster.

As Veyra stepped down from the wagon, aided by Thorne's steady hand, a wave of whispers followed her progress like ripples in a pond.

"Gods above, that's her... the one from the canyon."

"Look at her face... the scar's real as death."

A mother pulled her child close, whispering, "Don't stare. That's the Canyon Ghost. She walks between the living and the dead."

Veyra ignored them all, her focus absolute. While Thorne directed his patrol to reinforce the perimeter, she moved to the edge of the controlled chaos, every sense drinking in details. The color of the flames—white-green at the base, wrong for wood or oil. The hiss of the smoke—too sharp, almost acidic. The smell—sulfur and copper and something else, something that made her burns throb with recognition.

"Get a bucket line from the harbor!" a Watch sergeant was shouting. "Water! We need water now!"

"NO!" 

Veyra's voice wasn't particularly loud, but it cut through the noise with the sharp edge of absolute certainty. Every head turned to her.

"Sand, not water!" she commanded, already moving despite her limp. "It's white phosphorus mixed with alchemical accelerant. Water will make it explode!"

As if to prove her point, a stray bucket of water—already in motion from an overeager volunteer—arced through the air and splashed against the blaze. The fire erupted with a furious roar, a geyser of white-hot flame that sent guards scrambling backward, several crying out as the heat singed exposed skin.

The sergeant who'd given the water order stood frozen, his face pale with the realization of what could have happened if they'd formed that bucket line. In that instant, every soldier present understood that she knew this particular hell in ways their training never covered.

Another captain arrived with the clipped step of official authority—Grimsby, a man who wore regulations like armor and viewed flexibility as weakness. He stopped short of the active zone, maintaining a safe distance while fixing Thorne with a disapproving stare.

"Captain Brightward," he said, each word measured and recorded. "Control your scene. You have a civilian—an injured civilian—wandering into an active emergency zone. Do you want a commendation or a funeral procession?"

Thorne's response was measured, showing no emotion. Around them, ropes thudded against walls and boots scraped on cobblestones as the rescue continued its desperate rhythm.

"That's Veyra Thornwake," Thorne said simply. "She understands what this fire can do. We listened. People are alive because of it."

Grimsby's jaw worked as if chewing something bitter. "Your 'listening' sets dangerous precedent. Procedure exists because improvisation kills." His voice dropped, and for a moment, something raw flickered behind his eyes. "I've seen it, Brightward. Three years ago, a fire in the Trades Ward. Young lieutenant thought he knew better than protocol—led his men into a building the manual said was compromised. Saved two people in the front room. Lost four of his own when the floor collapsed exactly where our assessments said it would." He straightened, the vulnerability closing over like a wound. "Those four men had families too. Procedure isn't about cowardice. It's about not trading lives on a gamble."

Thorne was quiet for a moment, the accusation hitting harder than expected. When he spoke, his voice was less defiant. "I understand the cost of getting it wrong, Captain. But tonight, we had specific knowledge—"

"Knowledge you couldn't possibly verify in the moment," Grimsby cut in, though his tone had shifted from accusatory to something almost instructional. "You got lucky. She was right. What happens next time, when someone claims expertise and leads your men into a death trap?" He shook his head. "I'm not saying she was wrong tonight. I'm saying the precedent is dangerous. There has to be a system, or we're just gambling with lives based on whoever speaks loudest."

The words landed differently than Thorne expected. Grimsby wasn't wrong—not entirely. The captain had seen men die following instinct over protocol, just as Thorne had seen them die following protocol over instinct.

"Then help us build a better system," Thorne said finally. "One that can account for specialized knowledge without throwing the manual out entirely."

Grimsby studied him for a long moment, then gave a single, curt nod. "Put it in writing. I'll review it." He turned to leave, then paused. "For what it's worth, Brightward—I'm glad you were right tonight. Just don't expect me to celebrate procedure being ignored, even when it works out."

Meanwhile, Veyra had taken informal command of the actual rescue. Her voice carried over the chaos, each order precise and unquestionable.

"Venn! That beam's compromised—it'll fall in thirty seconds. Get those people out now!"

"Kelen! Sand from the mason's yard, two streets over. Run!"

"Halden! Wet cloths for smoke, but keep them away from the flames themselves!"

They worked as a fluid unit, Thorne's tactical authority executing Veyra's strategic vision. They pulled three people from an upper window, Venn guiding a terrified family across a groaning rooftop with steady hands and steadier words. In the thick, choking smoke, Veyra's lantern seemed to cast its light into pockets of clearer air, showing them the safest paths through the chaos—though whether it was luck, experience, or something else, she couldn't say. 

But their limitations quickly became apparent, each one a bitter lesson. Halden, despite his medical training, could do little for a man whose lungs were seared by chemical smoke beyond offering water and hollow comfort. A panicked child bolted from the building into the maze of alleys, and Veyra's wilderness tracking skills were useless against the city's stone labyrinth—the child vanished like smoke itself.

Worst of all were the cries from the basement workshop, where a family was trapped behind a collapsed wall. Thorne's men attacked the debris with desperate strength, but they were soldiers, not engineers. They didn't know which stone was load-bearing, which beam was decorative, which movement would bring the entire structure down.

The building groaned—a deep, final sound like a dying giant's last breath. Veyra heard it first, her head snapping up.

"BACK!" she roared. "Everyone back NOW!"

Thorne didn't hesitate. "You heard her! Full retreat!"

They scrambled backward, some dragging victims, others dropping tools. Ten seconds later, the entire facade collapsed inward with a roar that shook the street. Dust billowed outward in a choking cloud, and when it cleared, the basement entrance was sealed beneath tons of rubble.

The cries from below had stopped.

The barracks were tomb-quiet, thick with the smell of smoke and the heavier weight of incomplete victory. The patrol cleaned their gear in silence, each lost in their own thoughts about what they'd saved and what they'd lost.

It was Sergeant Kelen who broke the silence, addressing Thorne but looking at Veyra with something approaching reverence.

"Captain, her call on the phosphorus saved us from walking straight into death. If we'd formed that bucket line..." He trailed off, but everyone could finish the sentence.

"And the beam," Venn added, his usual humor absent. "I was three steps from being under it when she called the collapse. Three steps from being paste." He glanced at the lantern on the table, its flame steady and sure. "Noticed something else, too. That light of yours seemed to know which way to shine in the smoke. Like it was looking for safe paths."

"She saw the stress fractures," Darric said, voice full of professional awe. "Said the wood was 'screaming.' How do you hear wood scream?"

"You survive enough collapses," Veyra said quietly, speaking for the first time since they'd returned. "You learn the language of breaking things."

Thorne didn't make a grand speech. He simply stated a new truth that had been forged in the fire. "From now on, when we're facing something beyond our training, we listen to experience. Even if—especially if—that experience comes from outside the Watch."

He picked up a flask from the table, uncorked it, and raised it solemnly. "To the Watchmen who held the line."

The patrol drank, a shared moment of professional pride.

Then Thorne looked directly at Veyra, his expression carrying new understanding. He raised the flask again. "And to the light that shows us where the line needs to be crossed."

The men understood the shift that had just occurred. They raised their own cups to her—not to a superior officer, but to someone they would follow into hell itself. It was a pledge made without words, sealed with cheap whiskey and absolute conviction.

"It wasn't enough," she said, her voice steady despite the emotion beneath. "We have the will, we have the courage, but we don't have the right tools. We need more than soldiers."

"What do we need?" Thorne asked, though his tone suggested he already knew.

"Specialists," Veyra said, her tactical mind already working through the problem. "Someone who understands medicine beyond battlefield trauma. Someone who can read a building's bones before it falls. Someone who can track through city streets as easily as I track through wilderness."

She paused, meeting each of their eyes in turn. "We need people who understand that rescue isn't about protocols or politics. It's about bringing everyone home, no matter the cost."

"Then we find them," Thorne said simply.

"Or we become them," Kelen added, and the others nodded agreement.

Fayne had been sketching throughout the conversation—his way of processing. He turned his notebook around, showing a rough design: a lantern surrounded by reaching hands, with the words beneath: *No One Left Behind*.

"If we're doing this," he said quietly, "we should do it right. New name, new purpose, new promise to the city."

"The Last Light Company," Veyra said, testing the words. They felt right, heavy with purpose and promise.

"To the Last Light Company," Thorne said, raising his flask one final time. "May we be the light that guides them home."

They drank, and in that moment, something fundamental shifted. They were no longer just city guards maintaining order. They were something new, something necessary.

Something forged in fire and tempered by loss.

Outside, the city slept uneasily, unaware that its newest protectors had just been born from smoke and determination. In the corner, Veyra's lantern burned steady and sure, a small light against the vast darkness of all the disasters yet to come.

But it would be enough. They would make it enough.

Because now they understood: the light wasn't just about seeing in the dark.

It was about refusing to let the dark win.
