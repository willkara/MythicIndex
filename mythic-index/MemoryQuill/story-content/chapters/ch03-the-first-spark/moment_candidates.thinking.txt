Let me analyze Chapter 3 "The First Spark" systematically using the Visual Story Analyst framework.

## First Pass: Emotional Arc Analysis

The chapter progresses through three distinct scenes:
1. **Scene 1 (scn-03-01)**: A fragile normalcy → sudden crisis (alarm bells)
2. **Scene 2 (scn-03-02)**: Chaotic rescue operation → bitter limitations → tragedy
3. **Scene 3 (scn-03-03)**: Reflection, formation of the Last Light Company

**Emotional Journey**: Comfort → alarm → competence → helplessness → grief → resolve → hope

**Visual Thesis**: From the warm intimacy of found family to the harsh white-green of chemical fire, ending in the solemn amber glow of shared purpose.

**Dominant Mood Progression**:
- Comfortable camaraderie
- Sharp alarm/urgency
- Desperate competence
- Crushing limitation
- Quiet resolve
