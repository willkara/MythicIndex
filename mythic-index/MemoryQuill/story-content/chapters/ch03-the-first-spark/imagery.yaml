        chapter_context: |
          A utilitarian military interior transformed by lived-in warmth. Worn wooden tables scarred by knife marks and mug rings. A central stone hearth providing amber firelight that softens the hard edges of weapon racks and armor stands. The smell of leather, whetstone dust, and old woodsmoke. Practical—no decoration except company banners and functional equipment—but made home by the patina of daily use.

        chapter_context: |
          A three-story wooden tenement structure actively dying by fire. One wall has partially collapsed, revealing the building's timber frame skeleton like a split carcass. The fire burns wrong—white-green at the base where the alchemical accelerant burns, transitioning to normal orange-red above. Oily black smoke boils upward, thick and acrid. The street below is chaotic: bucket brigades forming uselessly, Watch establishing perimeter. Cobblestones slick with thrown water.

    visual_description: |
      A study in quiet ritual. Veyra sits at a small wooden table apart from the main group, her scarred hands methodically cleaning the glass of her battered lantern with a soft cloth. Her dark eyes are focused but distant. The burn scar on her face catches the lantern's amber glow. In the soft background blur, the shapes of patrol members gather near the hearth.
    composition_notes: |
      Close framing on Veyra's hands and face. Rule of thirds: hands with lantern lower-left, face upper-right. Shallow depth of field. Lantern illuminates face from below/side.
    visual_hook: "The reflection of steady flame in the glass she cleans, mirrored in the sharp focus of her dark eyes"

      The pivot point. Veyra stands with only a slight wobble, the torn bandage falling from her scarred hand, revealing pink raw healing skin on her forearm. Her jaw is set. Behind her, through a small window, the orange-red glow of distant fire paints the night sky. The warmth of the barracks lights one side of her face; the approaching fire colors the other. Thorne watches from the background with resigned understanding.

On the street below, chaotic response. A single figure in blue cloak (Thorne) directs the perimeter.

      A close-up shot of the partially collapsed tenement wall. The timber frame is exposed like a skeletal carcass, blackened and soot-covered. Caught in the jagged splinters is a single, small, clean wooden toy horse, perfectly preserved. Weak morning light filters through acrid smoke haze.
    composition_notes: |
      Tight square framing. Charred timber frame creates jagged lines. Unburnt toy is focal point. Shallow depth of field.

      The patrol gathered in the barracks, cleaning gear, now pausing to raise flasks. Thorne stands central, raising his flask to Veyra. Veyra stands slightly apart but included, holding her own cup. The hearth fire casts warm light on their faces, highlighting soot streaks and exhaustion, but also a new resolve. Kelen, Venn, Darric, and Fayne are all present, raising their cups.

      Vision crystallizes into symbol.
