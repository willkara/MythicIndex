Dragonsbreath still chased her through sleep. 

In the dream, she stood again in the canyon, but the physics were wrong—walls of glass rose like vertical rivers, and her friends walked through them as if through water. She tried to follow, but the glass was solid for her, always solid.

"Lysander! Behind you! The fire—" she screamed, but the words emerged as ash, crumbling from her lips.

The canyon's molten sky folded over and over like a blacksmith working steel, each fold a fresh wave of heat that never quite reached her. At the dream's edge stood a shadowed watcher—not cultist, not comrade—simply present, arms folded in contemplative stillness. 

"They are gone," the watcher's voice echoed, calm as stone. "You remain. This is the weight."

"No—I can save them," she fought back, dream-logic making it seem possible. "One more try—"

"The fire has already chosen," the watcher would say, its form unwavering. "As have you."

The dream always burst there, flinging her into wakefulness with a gasp. Her lungs clawed for air that tasted of thyme and healing herbs instead of ash. The transition was almost painful—the medicinal scent too clean, too alive.

She lay in Brightstone Healers' Hall beneath white gauze and soft light from dwarven rune-lamps. Bandages wrapped her ribs with professional precision; fresh salve cooled the worst of the cheek burn but could not hide the ragged starburst of scar tissue forming there. On the nightstand, her battered lantern glowed—someone had trimmed the wick and polished the glass. A small miracle of orderly light in a world that had turned to chaos.

"Easy, Commander," a gruff voice rumbled from the doorway. 

Dokra Ironvein stood silhouetted against the morning light—a dwarf built like a fortress, all solid angles and immovable presence. Her iron-gray hair was pulled back in severe braids, and her hands bore the calluses of someone who had set more bones than she could count.

"You're in Brightstone. You're safe."

"Safe?" Veyra's voice came out as a dry rasp, the word bitter on her tongue. "There's no safe. The fire finds everything."

"The fire's three days cold," Dokra said, her tone firm but not unkind. She stepped into the room, her presence somehow making the space feel more solid, more real. "You survived. That's what matters now."

"Four didn't," Veyra said flatly.

"No," Dokra agreed, pulling up a chair with a scrape of wood on stone. "They didn't. And you'll carry that. But you'll carry it forward, not in circles."

Dokra arrived the next morning with her rolling tray of implements—bone-handled shears, rune-etched forceps, a mortar that smelled of juniper sap and something sharper, medicinal. Trailing her came a lanky apprentice in spotless linen robes, his eyes bright with theoretical knowledge and zero practical experience with trauma.

"Morning, Commander," Dokra rumbled, her voice like gravel rolling in honey. "Time to change the wrappings before they fuse to the burn."

The apprentice—Journey-Healer Loran—lifted a phial of shimmering jade fluid with the reverence of someone handling liquid gold.

"This is restoration essence, derived from troll blood and blessed spring water," he recited with eager pride. "It encourages the body to forget its wounds, to return to its original state. The scarring would vanish within days, perhaps hours. You'd be whole again. Beautiful again—"

Veyra's good eye fixed on the phial with an intensity that made him step back. Her hand shot out, clamping his wrist with surprising strength.

"No."

Loran blinked, genuinely confused. "But... but the scarring is extensive. Without intervention, it will be permanent. The contracture alone will limit movement—"

"I was never beautiful," Veyra said, her voice low and dangerous. "I was useful. The scars keep me useful."

"I don't understand—"

"This," she touched her ruined cheek with her free hand, "is Lysander's shield. The mark where he stood between me and death. This," she traced the burns down her neck, "is Ignis's wild magic, the price of his desperate courage. Every mark is a memory. You want to erase them?"

"Whole is a story we tell ourselves," Dokra interjected, her voice a low rumble of understanding. "Scars are the truth we live."

Veyra released the apprentice, her hand falling to her lap. "They died unmarked. Perfect. I'll live marked. Imperfect. It's all I can give them now."

Loran swallowed hard. "I—I understand." But his gaze drifted to her ruined cheek, and professional instinct warred with newfound respect.

Dokra set down a thick poultice—a gritty mixture of troll-moss paste and crushed silverleaf, with micron-thin silver filings that caught the light. "This won't make you pretty," she said bluntly. "But it'll keep the tissue flexible, prevent the worst of the contracture. You'll have your range of motion, and the pain will fade to something manageable."

"Pain is good," Veyra said through gritted teeth as Dokra began applying the mixture. "Pain means I'm still here."

"Pain means you're healing," Dokra corrected, her hands surprisingly gentle despite their size. "There's a difference between remembering and punishing yourself."

"Is there?"

"Aye. One serves the living. The other serves nothing."

The salve burned—not like dragonfire, but like ice, a cold so intense it circled back to heat. Veyra's hands clenched the sheets, but she made no sound.

As they worked, Dokra spoke quietly, her words meant only for the three of them.

"Some wounds are made of iron, some of ink. The forge leaves marks on the blade to remember the hammer that shaped it." She tapped Veyra's bandaged forearm where healing skin bore the shadows of words that would become scars. "Don't shame the steel by trying to polish away every blow."

Loran absorbed this wisdom as he worked, his movements gaining confidence. When he reapplied the gauze, each fold was precise, respectful—not trying to hide the damage but to honor the healing.

"The body remembers everything," he murmured, half to himself. "Every wound leaves a map."

"Maps, not weaknesses," Dokra corrected. "This one's map just happens to be written in fire."

A ghost of something—not quite a smile—twitched at Veyra's mouth. "Only if the cartographer was drunk and angry."

Dokra barked a laugh that rattled the medicine bottles. "Best maps always are. Sober folk don't explore the interesting places."

Twilight painted the hospital room in shades of amber and shadow when Captain Thorne Brightward appeared at the threshold. He paused there, helm tucked under one arm, as if asking silent permission to enter. 

Veyra lifted two fingers from the bed—enter—and he crossed the room with measured steps.

"How fares the ward?" she asked, testing her voice. It came out stronger than that morning, though still rough.

"Less orderly since you started threatening the medical staff," he said, setting down a wrapped parcel on her bedside table. Steam filtered through the cloth—something that smelled of actual food, not hospital fare. "Bribed the kitchens. Spiced barley stew, fresh bread."

The aroma curled around her, warm and real and impossibly normal. "You'll spoil me, Captain."

"Strategic investment. Well-fed commanders make better decisions than starving ones."

Before she could respond, a series of crisp raps sounded at the doorframe. Thorne's patrol entered single-file, each carrying something.

Sergeant Kelen bore a flask of lamp oil, the good kind that burned clean and long. "Fresh oil for the lantern, Commander," he said, his gruff voice unusually gentle.

"You're maintaining it?" Veyra asked, genuinely surprised.

"Someone has to," Kelen replied. "Thing saved your life. Least we can do is keep it burning."

Corporal Darric unfolded a small pennon—blue and silver, with a lantern embroidered at its heart. "Blue for water, silver for moonlight," he explained. "Water quenches fire, moonlight guides through darkness."

"Water over flame..." Veyra murmured, touching the fabric. "We needed water. There was none."

"There is now," Darric said simply.

Archer Venn balanced a slim ashwood case containing new arrows, each fletched with cerulean feathers. "Cerulean fletching from storm-petrel feathers," he said with a slight grin. "Steadier flight in harsh winds. Figured your next shots deserve better than standard issue."

"I don't deserve—" Veyra started.

"Not about deserving," Venn interrupted gently. "It's about tomorrow. Tomorrow needs you armed."

Medic Halden set down a bucket of river stones in ice water. "For the burn memories," he explained in his clinical tone. "When the phantom heat comes—and it will—submerge your hands. Ten breaths. The cold shocks the nerves, tells them the fire's gone."

Veyra tested the water with one finger, hissing at the cold. "Gods, that's like winter's own bite."

"Good. Fire's opposite. Your body needs to remember things other than burning."

Finally, Quartermaster Fayne stepped forward, placing four smooth river pebbles on the blanket. Each bore a letter etched in copper: L, E, B, I.

"For remembrance," Fayne said quietly. "Small enough to carry, heavy enough to matter."

Veyra's throat tightened. She picked up the 'L' stone, thumb tracing the letter. "Lysander always said I overthink everything."

"Was he wrong?" Fayne asked gently.

"Never. Bastard was never wrong." Her voice cracked slightly on the last word.

The patrol stood in comfortable silence for a moment, their presence filling the room with something warmer than sympathy—solidarity.

Thorne finally spoke. "There's water now. And food. And time."

"Time for what?" Veyra asked, looking up at him.

"To decide what comes next."

She looked at each of them, these soldiers who had become something more. Then her gaze fell to the lantern, its light steady and sure.

"They'd want me to keep going," she said, not quite a question.

"Then we keep the light burning," Kelen said, his voice a low rumble of agreement.

Venn raised an imaginary cup. "To the ones who can't drink with us."

"To the fallen," the patrol echoed quietly.

Before departing, Thorne set his helm on the stool beside her lantern—iron keeping watch over light. "Rest, Commander. We'll hold the watch tonight."

"Don't let the light go out," she whispered.

"Never on our watch," he promised.

The hospital settled into its nighttime rhythm—soft footsteps, distant coughs, the whisper of robes on stone. Veyra lay awake, watching the lantern's flame paint shadows on the ceiling.

"Should have seen it," she whispered to the flame. "Ritual drainage channels. Classic cult configuration." She traced the memory of them on her blanket with one finger. "You saw it, didn't you? You tried to warn me with that flare."

The flame flickered twice—almost like a nod—and for a moment she could swear she heard Lysander's voice, warm and teasing: *"Trust your instincts, Scout. Even when they're inconvenient."*

"I did," she answered the ghost. "They were wrong."

*"Were they? You're alive."*

"That's not a victory."

*"Isn't it? Ask Elara if she'd rather you died too."*

"I can't ask her anything," Veyra said bitterly. "She's dead."

*"And you're not. That means something."*

"It means I failed."

*"It means you get to try again."*

The flame steadied, growing brighter for just a moment, as if emphasizing the point. Veyra unconsciously turned the lantern toward the window—toward the city beyond, where others might need help.

"Talking to ghosts, Commander?" 

Dokra stood in the doorway, a cup of something steaming in her weathered hands. She entered without waiting for permission, setting the cup on the nightstand. The smell of chamomile and something earthier, more medicinal, filled the air.

"They're louder than the living sometimes," Veyra admitted.

"Aye," Dokra said, settling into the chair Thorne had vacated. "The dead have nothing left to lose, so they speak plain. What do they say to you?"

"That I should have died with them."

"That's not the dead talking. That's guilt wearing their faces."

Veyra turned to look at her. "How do you know?"

"Because I've buried enough people to know what the dead really want." Dokra's eyes were ancient, full of griefs Veyra couldn't imagine. "They want us to live. To remember them, yes, but to live. Your friends didn't die so you could follow them into the dark."

"They died because I led them into a trap."

"They died because cultists set a trap. You survived because you're too stubborn to die easy." Dokra stood, pressing the warm cup into Veyra's hands. "Drink. Sleep. Heal. Tomorrow you can decide if you want to waste their sacrifice or honor it."

"And if I can't carry this weight?"

"Then we help you carry it," Dokra said simply. "That's what the living do for each other. We share the load until it gets lighter, or we get stronger. Either way, we don't let each other fall."

After she left, Veyra sipped the tea—bitter, medicinal, but somehow comforting. She looked at the four stones on her nightstand, at the lantern's steady glow, at the pennon draped over the chair.

"Alright," she whispered to the flame, to her ghosts, to herself. "I'll try. But if I fall—"

The flame flickered, and she could almost hear Borin's gruff voice: *"Then we'll catch you, lass. That's what family does."*

For the first time since the canyon, she let herself believe it might be true.

Morning came with Dokra changing her bandages and Thorne arriving with breakfast—actual eggs, not the gray porridge the hospital usually served. 

"You're spoiling me again," Veyra said, but she ate with something approaching appetite.

"Building your strength," he corrected. "For what comes next."

"And what's that?"

Thorne set down a rolled parchment. "Transfer orders. Grimsby wants you declared medically unfit for duty. Says the trauma has left you unstable."

"He's not wrong."

"He's not right either." Thorne's jaw tightened. "You saved lives at that fire. Your instincts, your experience—we need that."

"The City Watch doesn't need broken scouts who see ghosts."

"No," Thorne agreed. "But maybe something new does. Something that isn't bound by Watch protocols and politics."

Veyra studied him. "What are you suggesting?"

"I'm suggesting that 'no one left behind' shouldn't just be a dying woman's vow in a canyon. It should be a promise the city makes to everyone who needs rescue."

"Pretty words. The Lords would never fund it."

"The Lords fund what they have to. If we prove the need, show the results..." He trailed off, but his eyes were bright with possibility.

"We'd need specialists," Veyra said slowly, her tactical mind already working despite herself. "Not just soldiers. Healers who understand trauma. Engineers who can breach collapsed buildings. Trackers who can work in urban environments."

"Then we find them."

"We'd need a charter. Legal standing."

"I know a clerk who owes me favors."

"We'd need a base of operations."

"There's an old watch station in the Trades Ward. Been empty for years."

Veyra realized he'd thought this through. "You're serious."

"As dragon fire." He leaned forward. "The question is: are you?"

She looked at the lantern, at the stones on her nightstand, at the scars forming on her hands. The weight was still there—would always be there. But maybe, with help, she could carry it forward instead of in circles.

"What would we call ourselves?" she asked.

Thorne smiled, the expression transforming his usually stern face. "You carried a light through three days of darkness. You brought them home when everything said it was impossible. What else could we be but the Last Light Company?"

The name settled over her like a mantle—heavy but right.

"Alright, Captain," she said, sitting up straighter despite the pull of healing skin. "Let's bring them home. All of them."

Outside, morning bells began to toll across Waterdeep, and for the first time since the canyon, they sounded like a beginning rather than an end.
