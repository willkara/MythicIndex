      A surreal dreamscape. Veyra stands with her back to the viewer, hands pressed against a towering vertical wall of rippling glass. Through the glass, distorted figures of her friends walk away as if through water. The sky above is a folding, molten sheet of orange and ash-gray. A shadowy watcher stands at the far edge of the frame, arms folded. Veyra's silhouette is sharp, desperate, while the world beyond the glass is fluid and unreachable.
    composition_notes: |
      Ultra-wide shot. Veyra's small, dark figure in the center-left foreground against the massive scale of the glass wall. The molten sky dominates the upper third. The shadow watcher is a subtle detail in the periphery.

A phial of glowing jade liquid is held in the healer's hand, caught mid-air. In the background, slightly out of focus, Dokra Ironvein watches with a knowing, approving expression. Veyra's face is partially visible, fierce and resolute, the fresh burn on her cheek prominent.

Thorne with his helm, Kelen with oil, Darric with the pennon, Venn with arrows, Halden with the bucket, Fayne with stones. The room is painted in amber sunset light coming through the window, mixing with the warm glow of Veyra's lantern on the bedside table.

      Wide shot of the hospital room filled with bright, clean morning light streaming through the open mullioned windows. Dust motes dance in the air. Veyra sits on the edge of the bed, feet on the floor, looking at Thorne who stands nearby leaning against the wall with a smile. The lantern sits unlit now, but gleaming in the sun. The mood is crisp, airy, and hopeful. A view of the city roofs is visible through the window.
