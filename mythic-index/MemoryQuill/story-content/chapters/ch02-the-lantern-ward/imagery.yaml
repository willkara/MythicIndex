        chapter_context: |
          A healing institution built of pale ashlar stone—blocks fitted with dwarven precision. Tall mullioned windows diffuse soft light through gauze privacy screens. Dwarven rune-lamps mounted in brass brackets cast steady, shadowless illumination throughout the ward—a warm amber glow that doesn't flicker like torchlight. The air carries notes of thyme, dried lavender, and antiseptic compounds. The atmosphere is clinical but not cold—pragmatic healing rather than spiritual comfort. Veyra's private room features a sturdy wooden bed with clean linen, a bedside table bearing her battered lantern (still glowing), and a mullioned window that faces east toward the harbor.

        chapter_context: |
          A surreal, distorted version of the canyon where Veyra's comrades died. In the nightmare, the walls have become vertical sheets of glass—transparent but impenetrable. The sky above is molten, folding over itself like a blacksmith working steel—amber and orange and black. Scale is wrong—vast and oppressive simultaneously. Ghostly figures walk through the glass as if through water. The atmosphere is suffocating, dreamlike, wrong. Color palette: sepia, molten amber, ash-gray, obsidian black.

      Veyra stands trapped behind a wall of vertical glass in a nightmare version of Undershade Canyon. Her palms press against the transparent barrier as ghostly figures of her fallen comrades walk through the glass ahead of her. Her mouth is open in a scream, but the words emerging have become ash—gray particles crumbling and falling from her lips. Above, the sky folds over itself in impossible geometries.

      Wide establishing shot. Veyra positioned left-of-center, pressed against glass. Dutch tilt to emphasize disorientation. Rule of thirds: Veyra left, ghosts center.

      An extreme close-up of the polished oak nightstand in Veyra's room at Brightstone. Her battered, rusty metal lantern sits in the center, its glass recently 'trimmed and polished,' casting a steady, pale gold halo across the wood. Beside it, a simple ceramic bowl of clear, cooling broth and a neatly folded stack of white gauze bandages. A small drop of amber oil has spilled onto the wood.

      Tight square framing on the nightstand surface. The lantern is the central focal point. Shallow depth of field.

    visual_description: |
      A POV shot from Veyra's perspective within the 'nightmare version' of Undershade Canyon. Her 'deep earth-brown' palms are pressed flat against a 'transparent barrier' of vertical glass that fills the frame. Through the 'rippled' and distorted surface of the glass, the blurry, 'ghostly' shapes of her fallen comrades are visible. The air is thick with falling 'gray ash particles.'
    composition_notes: |
      Extreme close-up perspective. The palms of the hands and the glass barrier occupy the immediate foreground. High contrast between the 'molten amber' reflections and the 'cold gray' of the ash.
    visual_hook: "Dark, tattooed palms pressed against a rippled glass wall, through which the ghosts of the dead walk like memories through water."

      An intimate, charged confrontation in a hospital room. Veyra's bandaged hand grips Journey-Healer Loran's wrist with white-knuckle intensity. Between them, a jade-green phial of restoration essence trembles, its shimmer casting a sickly-beautiful glow across their skin. Veyra's expression is fierce, dangerous.
