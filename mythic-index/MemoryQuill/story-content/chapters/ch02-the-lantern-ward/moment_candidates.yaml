    source_excerpts:
      - "'Alright, Captain,' she said, sitting up straighter despite the pull of healing skin. 'Let's bring them home. All of them.'"
      - "Outside, morning bells began to toll across Waterdeep, and for the first time since the canyon, they sounded like a beginning rather than an end."
      - "'What else could we be but the Last Light Company?'"
    
    selection_rationale: "The narrative milestone that closes the chapter's arc. Transitioning from lantern-lit night to bell-rung dawn, from survivor to commander, from grief to purpose. The visual captures both the cost (healing skin pulling) and the commitment (sitting up anyway)."
