Let me analyze this chapter systematically using the Visual Story Analyst framework.

## First Pass - Read and understand the emotional arc

Chapter 2: "The Lantern Ward" follows Veyra's recovery in Brightstone Healers' Hall after the canyon incident. The chapter moves through:

1. **Scene 1 (scn-02-01)**: Veyra wakes from nightmare/dream of the canyon, meets Dokra who grounds her
2. **Scene 2 (scn-02-02)**: Medical treatment scene - the pivotal choice to keep her scars
3. **Scene 3 (scn-02-03)**: The patrol's vigil - bringing tokens and support
4. **Scene 4 (scn-02-04)**: Night conversation with "ghosts" and Dokra's counsel
5. **Scene 5 (scn-02-05)**: The dawn decision - founding the Last Light Company

Emotional arc: Trauma/nightmare → painful choice/defiance → community/support → acceptance/hope → purpose/beginning

I'll continue analyzing the key characters who support Veyra's transformative journey. Thorne Brightward emerges as a crucial supportive ally, with his weathered appearance and symbolic lantern representing hope and guidance. Sergeant Kelen represents the practical, grounded military perspective, his scarred hands and regulation appearance suggesting discipline and shared experience of survival.

The patrol support team reveals fascinating character dynamics through their distinctive visual identifiers and symbolic gifts. Corporal Darric, a shield dwarf with stern determination, carries a pennon - a small banner symbolizing unit pride. Archer Venn, a wood elf with a confident demeanor, offers an arrow, potentially representing precision and strategic intent. Medic Halden, with his nervous energy and medical background, brings an ice stone, suggesting healing and preservation.

Quarter Master Fayne emerges as a rock gnome intellectual, characterized by brass spectacles and ink-stained fingers, bearing memorial stones that hint at historical preservation. Journey-Healer Loran appears as a young, eager apprentice, holding a jade restoration essence phial that symbolizes potential and nascent healing capabilities.

The scene's initial moment focuses on a haunting nightmare involving Lysander traversing a glass canyon, with words dissolving into ash and a mysterious shadowed watcher observing - suggesting deep psychological complexity and potential metaphysical tension.

The scoring system evaluates narrative moments across multiple dimensions: emotional resonance, visual distinctiveness, narrative progression, character development, and symbolic density. This systematic approach allows for nuanced scene selection and thematic exploration.

1. Veyra's forceful intervention with Loran represents a critical character-defining instant. Her physical restraint of the wrist communicates profound emotional resistance, marking a transformative narrative pivot.

2. Her exploration of personal scars reveals deep psychological complexity. By narrating each wound as a personal story, Veyra transforms physical trauma into a powerful metaphorical landscape of identity and survival.

3. The emerging scene suggests intense interpersonal dynamics, with moments of physical and emotional tension that illuminate character motivations and internal struggles.

The patrol's entrance introduces a communal dimension, each member bearing symbolic gifts that suggest intricate social rituals and shared cultural practices. Their synchronized movement hints at underlying collective purpose and interconnectedness.

Veyra's intimate interaction with the 'L' stone reveals profound personal history. Her tactile connection to the object, coupled with Lysander's remembered critique, suggests deep emotional complexity and introspective tendencies.

Thorne's placement of his helm beside her lantern creates a powerful visual metaphor. The juxtaposition of iron and light symbolizes protection, vigilance, and the delicate balance between martial strength and illumination.

The fragmentary toast - "To the ones who can't drink with us" - implies unspoken loss and remembrance, hinting at deeper narrative threads of sacrifice and memory.

In the night scene, Veyra's whispered confession to the flame becomes a haunting ritual of guilt. Her tracing of patterns on the blanket and the flame's responsive flicker suggest a supernatural intimacy, with her words "They died because I led them into a trap" revealing profound emotional weight.

Dokra's gesture of pressing a warm cup into her hands offers a subtle moment of comfort and connection, bridging the chasm of her internal turmoil.

The dawn scene marks a transformative decision. Veyra, prompted by morning bells, sits straighter and declares her resolute intention: "Let's bring them home. All of them." This moment represents hope emerging from previous darkness, a founding pivot in her journey.

Key scene candidates reveal emotional depth. The nightmare sequence establishes visual and emotional groundwork. Veyra's interactions with the 'L' stone and her scars demonstrate intimate grief and personal revelation. Her whispered communication with flame and ghosts underscores profound character complexity.

The top moments blend bureaucratic tension with deeply personal emotional landscapes, each scoring above 18 and revealing critical narrative turning points. Selecting key narrative moments across different scenes, focusing on unique character and symbolic interactions. Prioritizing moments that reveal depth without redundancy. Carefully balancing scene representation to capture essential emotional and narrative progression.

Potential selections include pivotal character revelations, symbolic interactions, and foundational narrative beats that illuminate Veyra's journey. Tracing thematic connections between moments while maintaining scene diversity.

Considering scene-specific nuances and avoiding overrepresentation from single narrative segments. Strategic selection emphasizes character development, emotional turning points, and symbolic significance. The helm moment can be subtly integrated into visual design elements, avoiding a dedicated card. 

I'll finalize the seven moments, carefully balancing narrative depth and visual storytelling. Each moment captures a distinct aspect of the scene - from heroic landscape to intimate character interactions, from community mood to symbolic gestures. The selection provides a comprehensive yet focused visual narrative that highlights key emotional and thematic elements without overwhelming the composition.

The moment types reveal a nuanced approach: establishing wide shots, pivotal changes, intimate revelations, atmospheric scenes, specific details, and metaphorical symbols. This strategic categorization ensures a rich, layered storytelling experience.

I'll organize these seven moments to create narrative depth, balancing surreal establishing shots with intimate character revelations and symbolic transitions. The sequence captures emotional progression through carefully selected visual and thematic moments.
