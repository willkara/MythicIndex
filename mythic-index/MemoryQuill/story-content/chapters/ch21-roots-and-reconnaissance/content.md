A week had passed since Lady Blackwater's briefing, and Marcus Heartbridge found himself staring at a collection of documents spread across his private workspace on the mezzanine level of the main warehouse. The high windows cast shifting patterns of light across the papers that represented dead ends—every contact, every favor called in, every discreet inquiry about Korrath had yielded the same result: nothing current.

The latest frustration had come just an hour ago. He'd met with a contact at the Silken Siren, a tavern known for discrete information exchanges. The man, a fence who specialized in magical items and knew most of the arcane engineers in the city, had promised information about Korrath's current whereabouts.

Marcus had arrived to find the fence nervous, constantly glancing at the door. "Can't help you," the man had said quickly, sliding Marcus's gold back across the table. "That name... it's poison. Anyone asking about him gets visits from unpleasant people. I've got a family."

"Who's protecting him?" Marcus had pressed.

"Not protecting. Warning off. Someone doesn't want him found, but I don't think it's him doing it." The fence had left quickly after that, leaving Marcus with another dead end and more questions.

Now, back at the warehouse, Marcus muttered, "He's good at staying hidden. Too good. Or someone's keeping him hidden."

Veyra approached from the Briefing Circle below, noting the frustration in his usually composed demeanor. "What do we know?"

"Korrath Threnx was active in Waterdeep's arcane engineering circles about five years ago," Marcus replied, tapping one of the documents. "Brilliant work, innovative designs. He and Cidrella Vexweld were partners in several high-profile projects. Then... nothing. No contracts, no commissions, no public work."

"People don't just vanish," Thorne observed, joining their conversation. "Especially not specialists with that level of skill."

"Exactly. Which means either he's dead, he's left the city entirely, or..." Marcus paused meaningfully.

"Or he's found work that doesn't require public records," Veyra finished. "The kind of work the Silent Hand might need."

Marcus nodded grimly. "I have three more contacts to try, but if they turn up empty, we may need to consider a more direct approach."

"Through Cid?" Thorne asked quietly.

"It may come to that. But we need to be extremely careful. If Korrath is involved with the Silent Hand, approaching him through her could put her in danger."

From across the warehouse came the rhythmic hammering of Grimjaw's forge and the quiet conversation of team members settling into their new routines. The contrast between the domestic normalcy and their dangerous mission planning felt surreal.

"Keep trying," Veyra decided. "We have time. Lady Blackwater said they wouldn't relocate for weeks yet."

Three days later, the warehouse doors echoed with a cheerful knock that cut through the mid-morning bustle. Finn, who had been practicing his archery at targets set up in the loading area, called out, "I'll get it!"

The woman who entered was a force of barely contained energy. Copper-red hair escaped from practical braids, her left arm gleamed with intricate mechanical construction, and her eyes lit up as they swept across the cavernous space with professional interest.

"Oh, this is wonderful!" she exclaimed, stepping inside without invitation. "Just wonderful! You're the new company everyone's been talking about, aren't you? The ones from Westwall? I heard about it at the party—well, not at the party exactly, but about the party. The Azure Pavilion gathering? Everyone's been talking about it. I wasn't invited, of course—arcane engineers rarely are unless someone needs something specific—but the stories that came out of it!"

Veyra emerged from the planning area, instantly alert. She recognized the description from Vera's intelligence reports—Cidrella Vexweld had just walked into their headquarters.

"I'm Commander Veyra Thornwake," she said carefully. "And you are?"

"Cidrella Vexweld! My friends call me Cid." She gestured enthusiastically at the warehouse. "I heard a new organization had taken over this space, and I just had to see it for myself. I specialize in arcane engineering and logistical optimization. This space has such potential!"

Marcus appeared from the shadows, his expression carefully neutral as he took in their unexpected visitor. Thorne followed, his hand resting casually near his sword hilt.

"Services?" Veyra asked, playing ignorant.

"Oh yes! Workflow analysis, structural modifications, magical infrastructure—that sort of thing." Cid bounced slightly on her toes, her enthusiasm infectious despite the tension in the room. "You've got excellent bones here, but your current setup is... well, functional but hardly optimized."

She launched into an impromptu tour, pointing out load-bearing supports, ventilation patterns, and spaces that could be better utilized. Her assessment was purely professional, free of any hidden agenda—just a craftsperson excited about a challenging project.

"The lighting could be dramatically improved with some reflective enchantments," she continued, examining the high windows. "And if you ever need secure meeting spaces, the acoustics in here would make sound dampening relatively straightforward."

Aldwin, attracted by the animated discussion, joined the group. "Secure meeting spaces would be valuable," he said mildly. "Some of our work involves... sensitive discussions."

Cid's expression grew more serious, the bubbly enthusiast replaced momentarily by a focused professional. "Ah, confidentiality concerns. Yes, I can work with that. Magical suppression fields, sound dampening, scrying protection—all quite doable in a space this size."

"That's quite a skill set," Marcus observed casually.

"Oh, I love the technical challenges!" Cid replied, her brightness returning. "Each project is like a puzzle. You have to understand not just the magic and the engineering, but how people actually use spaces. What are their patterns? What do they need to feel secure and productive?"

She paused, looking around at the assembled Company members with genuine interest. "You all have such an interesting energy. Very... purposeful. I bet you're the sort of people who need flexible spaces that can adapt quickly."

"You could say that," Veyra replied with a slight smile.

She paused in her assessment, her gaze falling on Veyra, and her expression shifted to something more serious, almost sympathetic. "Commander, I don't mean to be forward, but... your scarring. The pattern is consistent with magical burning, isn't it? Not ordinary fire."

Veyra stiffened slightly, but Cid continued, seemingly oblivious to the tension.

"I only ask because I understand magical... mishaps." She raised her mechanical arm. "This wasn't by choice. Wild magic surge when I was younger. My entire left arm was transformed into living crystal. Pretty, but completely useless. Took three years and seven different artificers to create this replacement." She flexed the mechanical fingers with obvious pride. "Now it's better than the original in many ways, but the process... well, magical injuries leave more than physical scars, don't they?"

There was a moment of unexpected connection—two women marked by magical trauma, finding brief understanding.

"They do," Veyra said quietly.

Cid nodded, then immediately brightened again, her natural enthusiasm returning. "Well! I should let you get back to your work. But if you're interested in some optimization consulting, I'd love to come back with some preliminary sketches. No obligation, of course—I just can't resist a good challenge!"

After she left, the Company leadership gathered around the planning table in contemplative silence.

"Well," Marcus said finally. "That was unexpected."

"She's exactly as Vera described her," Veyra observed. "Brilliant, enthusiastic, and completely focused on the work."

"Which makes her either the perfect innocent or the perfect cover," Thorne added skeptically.

Marcus shook his head. "I've been reading people's motivations for twenty years. That woman is driven by pure curiosity and professional pride. If she's involved in something dark, she has no idea."

"So we have an opportunity," Veyra concluded. "The question is how to use it without putting her in danger."

The marketplace accident happened on a day when Finn, Darric, and Halden had ventured out on the fifteen-minute walk to purchase supplies for Mistress Elba's expanding kitchen. The Artisan Quarter was bustling with late morning commerce—merchants hawking their wares, street performers drawing crowds, children darting between the legs of adults, and the general controlled chaos that marked Waterdeep's commercial heart.

The crash, when it came, cut through the noise like a thunderclap.

A heavily loaded cart carrying stone blocks for a nearby construction project had lost a wheel. The sudden stop had caused the load to shift, and several tons of stone were now sliding inexorably toward a group of children who had been playing in the market square.

Finn reacted first, his ranger reflexes sending him sprinting toward the children. "Move! Everyone move!" he shouted, but there wasn't time for all of them to escape.

Without hesitation, Finn threw himself against the largest stone block, his lean frame straining against the impossible weight. He couldn't stop it, but he slowed it just enough for three of the children to scramble clear.

"Push!" he screamed to anyone who would listen. "Help me push!"

Two burly merchants joined him, adding their weight, but the stone was winning.

Darric was right behind him, his soldier's training taking over. He grabbed a long wooden beam from a nearby stall and jammed it under the stone, creating an improvised lever. "Halden! Help me with this!"

The medic abandoned his supply purchases and threw his weight against the beam. Together, the three Company members managed to redirect the stone's momentum, sending it rolling harmlessly into an empty fountain.

The market fell silent for a moment, then erupted in grateful chaos. Children cried, parents rushed forward, and merchants began talking all at once.

But Halden was already moving. One child had a deep gash on his leg from flying debris. The medic dropped to his knees, pulling supplies from his ever-present kit.

"Hold still, lad," he said calmly, his hands already working. "This'll sting a bit, but you'll be running again in no time."

He cleaned the wound with practiced efficiency, applied a healing salve, and wrapped it with clean bandages, all while keeping up a steady stream of reassuring chatter that kept the boy from panicking.

A crowd had gathered by now, watching the three Company members work with growing admiration. The cart's owner, a grizzled mason, approached the three men with tears in his eyes.

"My grandson," he said simply, gesturing to one of the children they'd saved. "I... how can I thank you?"

"No thanks needed," Finn replied, still breathing hard from the exertion. "Anyone would have done the same."

But that wasn't true, and everyone in the market knew it. Most people would have watched in horror, helpless to act. These three had moved without thinking, putting themselves at risk for strangers.

Word spread quickly through the Dock Ward. Within an hour, a small crowd had gathered to thank them personally. An elderly woman pressed a basket of fresh bread into Finn's hands. A jeweler offered to repair any damaged equipment for free. The mason whose grandson had been saved simply stood there, tears streaming down his weathered face, unable to speak his gratitude.

By evening, the story had grown in the telling—three heroes from the new company had saved a dozen children from certain death. Mistress Elba returned from her own market errands with enough free vegetables "for those brave boys" to feed the entire Company for a week.

"We're becoming part of the community," Veyra observed that evening as she listened to the exaggerated retellings from various Company members. "That's good. It means we belong here, not just exist here."

"It also means we'll be noticed more," Marcus added pragmatically. "Both by friends and enemies."

"Let them notice," Grimjaw growled from his forge. "Better they know we're the sort who help rather than harm."

Two weeks into their residence in the warehouse complex, the Last Light Company had developed rhythms. Mornings began with Mistress Elba's breakfast in The Mess and a briefing around the Briefing Circle. Days were spent on training in the Loading Bay area, maintenance work flowing between all three buildings, and increasingly, intelligence work conducted in the privacy of the mezzanine offices. Evenings brought shared meals and the comfortable exhaustion of productive work.

Grimjaw's forge in Building B had become the heartbeat of the entire complex, its rhythmic hammering marking time like a metallic clock that carried through the covered walkways. The dwarf had discovered a genuine gift for more than just weapons—he'd crafted hinges for the interior doors, repaired decades of small breakages throughout all three buildings, and was halfway through building a proper kitchen expansion for Mistress Elba in The Mess.

"You're nesting," Fayne observed one evening, watching Grimjaw carefully file the edges of a new spoon he'd made.

"I'm creating functional tools," Grimjaw replied with dignity. "Tools we need."

"Uh-huh." Fayne's smirk was gentle. "And the decorative scrollwork on the handles?"

Grimjaw paused in his filing, examining the elaborate knotwork pattern he'd carved into the spoon's handle. It was, he had to admit, somewhat more ornate than strictly necessary.

"The scrollwork," he said slowly, as if explaining to a child, "serves multiple purposes. First, it provides a better grip. Second, it identifies the utensil as Company property, preventing theft. Third..." He paused, searching for another justification.

"Third?" Fayne prompted, clearly enjoying this.

"Third," Grimjaw continued with great dignity, "it demonstrates that we're not just some ramshackle mercenary group. We have standards. We have... craftsmanship."

"So the little flowers around the edge?"

"Those are not flowers," Grimjaw protested. "They're... geometric rosettes. Completely different thing. Traditional dwarven design element."

"They look like flowers to me."

"Then you need your eyes checked."

Fayne laughed, a warm sound that filled the forge area. "Grimjaw, it's okay to admit you want this place to feel like home. We all do."

The dwarf grumbled something unintelligible and returned to his filing, but there was a softness to his expression that hadn't been there before. After a moment, he spoke again, quieter this time.

"My workshop back in the mountains... I had tools there that my grandfather made. Each one with his mark, his patterns. Made the place feel... connected to something bigger." He held up the spoon, examining his handiwork. "Suppose I'm trying to start something similar here."

"It's working," Fayne said simply. "Every piece you make, every improvement... it's all adding up. We're becoming more than just colleagues sharing a space."

"Aye," Grimjaw agreed, then added with a return to his gruff manner, "Now get out of my forge before I put you to work on the bellows."

Finn had claimed a corner of the main space for his archery practice, setting up targets and a small workbench where he maintained his equipment and helped others with their own. His quiet competence had made him an unofficial quartermaster for smaller items—everyone knew to ask Finn if they needed arrows, bowstrings, or simple leather repairs.

Aldwin had established the most organized corner, creating a proper infirmary with shelves for supplies, a clean workspace for treating injuries, and a small herb garden in containers near the windows. The space felt peaceful, a refuge within the larger industrial environment.

Thorne split his time between training sessions with the combat-focused members and wrestling with paperwork at a desk Marcus had somehow acquired. The administrative requirements of their provisional status were endless, but Thorne approached them with the same methodical determination he brought to everything else.

Veyra found herself moving between all these spaces, checking in with her people, ensuring everyone had what they needed. It was during one of these evening rounds that she realized something important had happened without her noticing.

This felt like home.

Not the desperate camaraderie of a siege, or the temporary shelter of an inn between missions. This felt like a place they belonged, work they were meant to do, people they were meant to be with.

The realization was both comforting and terrifying. Comfort could make you soft. Attachment could make you hesitate when decisiveness was needed. But it also gave you something worth fighting for beyond mere survival.

When Cid returned four days later, she brought a leather portfolio stuffed with sketches, measurements, and architectural plans. Her enthusiasm had only grown during her absence.

"I couldn't stop thinking about your space," she announced, spreading papers across the central table. "You have such interesting requirements—flexible, secure, but also functional for daily life. It's a fascinating challenge!"

Her sketches were impressive. She'd designed modular wall systems that could create private meeting rooms when needed but fold away for large gatherings. Her plans for the infirmary included magically regulated climate control that would preserve Aldwin's supplies while maintaining sterile conditions for treatment.

"This secure briefing room," Marcus said, examining one drawing with professional interest, "you're confident it would defeat magical surveillance?"

"Absolutely," Cid replied with professional pride. "Though for complete impenetrability, you'd need deeper integration of structural warding and environmental magic. That level of sophistication requires... well, it requires someone who really understands both the magical theory and the practical applications."

She paused, her expression brightening. "I have a partner who's brilliant with that sort of work. We design some truly elegant security systems together."

Grimjaw looked up from where he'd been examining her sketches with professional interest. "Your structural support modifications are clever," he said, his tone carrying the respect of one craftsperson to another. "Though I notice you're assuming standard load calculations. This warehouse is older—the stone settles differently."

"Oh, you're absolutely right!" Cid exclaimed, immediately pulling out another sheet to make notes. "You must be the company's structural engineer. Your reputation from the library rescue has spread through the entire Mason's Guild."

"I handle structural matters," Grimjaw said carefully. "Though my expertise is more in... geological structures. Mines, caves, mountain fortifications. This above-ground work is newer to me."

"But the principles translate beautifully, don't they?" Cid began sketching rapidly, her mechanical hand moving with precision. "Load distribution is load distribution, whether it's holding up a mountain or a ceiling. Though I imagine you miss having proper stone to work with instead of these composite construction materials."

"Every day," Grimjaw admitted, warming to someone who understood the work. "Give me honest granite over this pressed-timber-and-mortar nonsense."

They fell into a rapid technical discussion that left most of the others behind, debating compression ratios and load-bearing calculations with the enthusiasm of scholars discussing ancient texts.

"You know," Cid said after a few minutes, "my partner would love this conversation. Korrath is brilliant with structural integration—finding ways to make the engineering and the magical elements support each other rather than just coexist. He's the best structural architect I've ever worked with."

Veyra and Marcus exchanged a careful glance. This was the opening they'd hoped for.

"Korrath?" Veyra asked casually.

"Oh yes, we work together on almost everything," Cid said, her enthusiasm evident. "He handles the grand design, the structural integrity, the theoretical soundness. He's the architect. I'm the artificer—I take his brilliant plans and figure out how to actually build the impossible parts. We complement each other perfectly."

"He sounds like a master of his craft," Marcus prompted gently.

"The best," Cid confirmed with a proud smile. "Korrath Threnx. He's been pushing me to think bigger with my projects for years. These plans, for instance—they're better because of his input."

As Cid continued her presentation, Veyra found herself genuinely impressed with the woman's skill and vision. More importantly, she felt confident in their earlier assessment. Cidrella Vexweld was exactly what she appeared to be—a talented engineer driven by curiosity and a desire to build things that helped people.

Which made her unwitting partnership with the people misusing her work a serious vulnerability.

After Cid left with promises to refine the designs based on their feedback, the Company leadership reconvened.

"She works with Korrath regularly," Marcus observed quietly. "They have an active partnership. She trusts him completely. They both seem to be entirely in the dark about how their work is being used."

"Which means they are both in incredible danger," Thorne concluded. "If the Silent Hand learns that we're asking questions, their 'brilliant engineers' might be considered loose ends."

"We'd be painting targets on two people who deserve protection, not endangerment," Veyra finished. "We need to find a way to approach them that doesn't expose them to that risk."

"Or we need to find a way to learn what we need without involving her directly," Marcus said thoughtfully. "There might be a way to investigate Korrath without putting her at risk. But it will require patience and subtlety."

Outside the warehouse, the sounds of Waterdeep's evening were settling into familiar rhythms. The Company had spent two weeks building their place in this community, earning trust and establishing themselves as protectors rather than threats.

Now they would have to decide how much of that trust they were willing to risk in pursuit of their mission.
