    lighting_suggestion: "Classic silhouette composition. Deep shadow in foreground, amber and pale gold on the eastern horizon behind them. The riders are dark shapes carrying the night's secrets into the coming day."

    source_excerpts:
      - "They mounted their horses in the pre-dawn darkness, the familiar weight of saddles and gear a comfort after the tension of the night."
      - "As they rode away from the facility, disappearing into the forest like the ghosts they'd proven themselves to be, the first hint of dawn touched the eastern horizon."
      - "They were returning to the Windborne Roost with their prize: the keys to the most secure prison in the region, and the terrible understanding of what would be required to use them."
    
    selection_rationale: "The closing image that bookends the chapter's visual journey. From moonlit determination to pre-dawn departure, the team has transformed from planning to proven. The silhouette composition against dawn light is a classic 'mission accomplished' image, but weighted with the knowledge of Rill's killing and the facility's true horrors. They're leaving as changed people."
