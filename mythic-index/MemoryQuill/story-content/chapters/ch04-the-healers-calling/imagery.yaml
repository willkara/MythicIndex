      A close study of hands and their object—Veyra's scarred fingers resting on the edge of a child's drawing. The mottled burn scars on her hands catch the candlelight. The drawing itself is simple but defiant: a child's interpretation of a rescue lantern on crinkled parchment. Behind her hands, the scarred wooden table surface shows honey-toned grain.
    composition_notes: |
      Tight framing on the hands and drawing. Child's drawing occupies lower center. Veyra's hands frame it. Shallow depth of field.
