I'll meticulously construct the imagery.yaml, mapping out a comprehensive visual narrative through precise specifications. The process demands careful architectural design, translating narrative essence into visual language.

My approach centers on crafting six distinct image specifications that capture character states, emotional resonance, and visual storytelling. Each specification will require strategic composition: technical parameters, mood rationales, and evocative stylistic elements.

The first image focuses intimately on Veyra's hands, suggesting vulnerability and resilience through scarred skin - a microcosm of her deeper journey.

The second image presents a compelling visual dichotomy: warm autumn light embracing the team, contrasted against a shadowed, ominous village landscape. This lighting split symbolizes transition, hope against despair, creating a powerful narrative tension through visual metaphor.

The palette and lighting choices will strategically communicate emotional subtext, transforming technical specifications into profound storytelling instruments.

The dominant mood remains unequivocally ominous, anchored by visceral details: the tar-black skull sign, oppressive silence, and the village's cold, sickly atmosphere. The team's warm light represents a final moment of safety before confronting inevitable darkness.

The emotional essence is "grim resolve" - a deliberate choice to advance despite clear signs of impending danger. The scene captures human courage at its most raw and vulnerable.

Precise visual elements underscore the mood: neat rows of wrapped bodies impose a chilling order on death, while desaturated grays punctuated by candlelight warmth suggest resilience amid overwhelming despair.

The tea ceremony scene balances spiritual depth with physical intimacy. Reverent peace emerges through a ritual grounded in a barn hospice, where mercy manifests as active compassion. Amber lanterns and herb smoke create a sacred space, transforming a simple act into something transcendent yet deeply human.

Aldwin's ceremony carries an almost magical quality - luminous, spiritual, where the tea itself tastes like renewal and hope emerges through compassionate presence. I'll illuminate the scene's emotional landscape through precise visual composition. The campfire gathering transforms the bronze brazier from a symbol of mortality to one of communal healing, casting warm amber light against a cool starlit backdrop. This visual metaphor weaves connection and comfort, using contrasting temperatures and tones to suggest emotional transition and shared resilience.
