The child's drawing of the lantern lay in the center of the barracks table, a spot of defiant yellow against the scarred wood. The parchment was crinkled at the edges, smudged with soot—a gift pressed into Veyra's hands by a girl who'd lost everything but gratitude. The smell of the gifted bread still lingered in the air, yeast and warmth mixing with the ever-present smoke that seemed to cling to everything since the Dock Ward fire. The debrief was over, but the weight of it remained, settling into the spaces between words like ash in the lungs.

Outside, the evening watch bell tolled, its bronze voice carrying across the Westwall compound. The sound seemed to pull everyone from their private thoughts.

It was Halden who spoke first, setting down his medical kit with more force than necessary. The leather satchel's buckles rattled against the table, a sharp punctuation to the silence. His voice emerged clinical but laced with a frustration that ran bone-deep, the kind that came from facing limits you couldn't overcome with effort alone.

"Captain, Commander," he began, his knuckles white as he gripped the table's edge. His eyes moved from Thorne to Veyra, seeking understanding. "My report is filed, but it's incomplete. I can stitch a wound and set a bone. I can keep a man from bleeding out on the field—done it more times than I can count. But those burns, the lung-rot from that smoke..." He paused, his jaw working as if chewing on bitter words. "That's a different kind of enemy. I was just patching holes in a sinking ship, watching good people drown in their own bodies. We need a true healer, someone who understands the *why* of an illness, not just the *how* of an injury."

The silence that followed was heavy with shared memory. They'd all seen the victims—children whose lungs rattled like broken bellows, adults whose burns refused to heal clean despite Halden's best efforts.

Veyra nodded slowly, her scarred fingers tracing the edge of the child's drawing with unexpected gentleness. "You did everything you could, Halden. More than most would have. You stayed when others fled." Her voice carried the weight of command, but underneath lay something softer—recognition of one soldier's limits meeting another's expectations. "But you're right. Our mission isn't just to pull people from the fire. It's to care for them after. To make survival mean something."

Thorne leaned forward, the candlelight casting deep shadows across his weathered face. His expression had shifted, memory pulling at the corners of his eyes. "I know a man," he said, his voice dropping to that particular register reserved for speaking of the lost or the legendary. "Or I did. From the Border Wars. A halfling medic named Aldwin Gentleheart. We called him 'Brother' Gentleheart, though he belonged to no temple."

He paused, gathering threads of memory like a man sorting through old letters. The others waited, recognizing the look of someone excavating the past.

"He wasn't just a healer. He was... a philosopher. Could bring a strange kind of peace to the most hellish field hospital. Places where men screamed themselves raw, where the smell of gangrene fought with burning flesh for dominance." Thorne's eyes grew distant. "He had these tea ceremonies. Said he was healing the *war* out of the soldiers, one cup at a time. Mad, we thought at first. But then you'd see it work. Men who'd been breaking apart inside would sit with him, sip his strange brews, and find... something. Not happiness, but acceptance. He could sit with a dying man and make it feel not like a defeat, but like a passage home."

"Sounds like exactly what we need," Veyra said quietly. "Someone who heals more than flesh."

"So where is he?" Venn asked, ever the pragmatist, cutting through sentiment to logistics.

Thorne's shoulders sagged, the energy leaving him like air from a punctured waterskin. "That's the problem. After the war, after seeing what we'd done to each other for lines on a map... he said he was done with the world's suffering. Vanished back to his village somewhere in the Greenfields. Haven't heard from him in three winters. He might not want to be found, and even if he did, the Greenfields stretch for leagues. I wouldn't know where to start looking."

"The Greenfields," Fayne mused, their voice thoughtful. "That's halfling country. Small villages, each one proud of its isolation. Finding one halfling who doesn't want to be found..." They shook their head. "Like finding a specific grain of wheat in a granary."

The streets of Waterdeep's Trades Ward were thick with the morning commerce—merchants hawking wares, cart wheels grinding over cobblestones, the distant ring of hammer on anvil from the smithy quarter. But inside Brightstone Healers' Hall, the world fell away into antiseptic quiet. The air hung heavy with the scent of medicinal herbs and something vaguely like cinnamon mixed with copper—blood and healing in equal measure.

The hall itself was a study in contrasts: elegant marble columns supporting a ceiling painted with scenes of Ilmater's mercy, while the floors bore the permanent stains of countless medical emergencies. Cots lined one wall, half occupied by patients in various states of recovery. A young apprentice moved between them, checking bandages with practiced efficiency.

Dokra Ironvein didn't bother with pleasantries when she emerged from the dispensary, her thick fingers still stained with some viscous green poultice. She moved with the rolling gait of a dwarf who'd spent too many years on her feet, but her grip when she grabbed Veyra's arm was iron-steady, immediately finding the still-tender burns beneath the commander's sleeve.

"So, the 'Lanternlight Lass' is collecting scars again," she rumbled, her touch surprisingly gentle as she peeled back fabric to examine the fresh burns. "Thought I told you that heroics were for folks with spare skin. These are going to mark you worse than the last ones."

"It was necessary," Veyra said simply, not flinching as Dokra prodded a particularly raw patch.

"It always is with you soldier types," Dokra grunted, reaching for a jar from her belt—a practiced motion that spoke of decades tending battlefield wounds. The salve she produced was pungent enough to make eyes water, smelling of mint and sulfur and something distinctly fungal. "Hold still. This'll sting like a devil's kiss before it numbs."

She wasn't wrong. Veyra's jaw tightened as the salve hit raw flesh, but she made no sound.

"We need a favor, Dokra," Thorne said, getting to the point while the dwarf worked. "We're looking for a healer. A halfling. Aldwin Gentleheart."

Dokra's hands stilled for just a moment, her bushy eyebrows climbing toward her hairline. "Gentleheart? That philosophical fool who thinks suffering is a teacher?" She snorted, a sound like rocks grinding together. "Course you'd be looking for him. Like calls to like among you martyrs."

"You know where he is?" Veyra asked, hope threading through her voice despite the pain.

"Know where he went," Dokra corrected, resuming her ministrations with perhaps more force than necessary. "The idiot walked into a plague zone. Deliberately. Said something about 'being where the need was greatest.' Gray Rot, they call it. No cure that I know of, and I know plenty. Only comfort to be offered, and precious little of that."

"Then he's exactly where he should be," Veyra said, her voice quiet but firm as granite.

Dokra looked up at her, searching the commander's scarred face. "It's a death sentence, girl. The Gray Rot doesn't just kill—it kills ugly. Turns the lungs to paper, the blood to water. Even being near the infected is a roll of dice with your life."

"So was the canyon," Veyra countered, meeting the dwarf's gaze steadily. "I'm still here."

"Stubbornness doesn't cure plague," Dokra grumbled, but something in her expression had shifted—perhaps respect, perhaps resignation.

"No," Veyra agreed. "But kindness might ease it. And that's what we need—someone who understands that healing isn't always about cure."

Dokra studied them for a long moment, her ancient eyes moving from Veyra's scarred determination to Thorne's steady loyalty. Whatever she saw made her sigh—a sound like wind through deep caves. She disappeared into the back of the hall, her footsteps echoing off the marble. The wait stretched, punctuated only by the soft moans of patients and the clink of glass vials from the dispensary.

When she returned, she held a scrap of parchment that looked like it had been torn from a larger map. Her expression was grim as old stone.

"There are whispers," she said, her voice dropping low enough that they had to lean in to hear. "Nasty plague, the Gray Rot, up in the foothills past the Westwood. Village called Oakhaven. Quarantined by the Lords' decree three weeks back, which is a polite way of saying abandoned to die. No one in or out, on pain of joining them." She pressed the parchment into Thorne's hand with unnecessary force. "They say a lone halfling healer walked *into* the quarantine zone a week ago. Walked right past the warning signs and the ward markers. Sounds like something that fool Gentleheart would do."

The crude map showed a winding path through the Westwood, ending at a skull marker with "PLAGUE – DEATH TO THOSE WHO ENTER" beneath it.

"If you're going, go now," Dokra continued, her voice rough with something that might have been concern. "Every day you wait is another day the disease spreads, another day he might..." She trailed off, then finished gruffly, "Try not to bring the plague back with you. I've got enough patients without adding you lot to the pile."

The journey preparations took six hours of preparation. This wasn't a rescue mission where they could charge in with swords drawn—this required different tools, different thinking. Veyra organized with quiet efficiency, her commands precise and economical.

"Halden, gather all the medical supplies we can spare. Focus on comfort items—clean cloth, willow bark for fever, anything for pain relief."

"We're not trying to cure them?" Halden asked, uncertain.

"If Dokra says there's no cure, we trust that," Veyra replied. "We're going to help a healer, not play at being one."

Thorne supervised the selection of the team. "Small group. We don't know what we're walking into, and too many people increases the risk of exposure. Veyra, myself, Halden for medical knowledge, and Venn for security."

"I should go," Darric protested. "You need more swords."

"We need the Watchpost defended," Thorne countered. "If something happens to us, the Company continues. That's an order, Corporal."

The sun was already tilting toward late afternoon when they set out at three in the afternoon, taking a covered supply wagon to avoid attracting attention. The last thing they needed was panic about plague-seekers in the city. As Waterdeep's walls fell behind them, the reality of their mission settled in like morning fog—thick and inescapable. The two-hour journey through Westwood to the quarantine boundary brought them to Oakhaven as evening shadows lengthened around five in the evening.

The journey to the quarantined village of Oakhaven led them through the Westwood, where autumn had already begun its work. The trees formed a canopy of gold and rust overhead, beautiful in its decay. But as they traveled deeper, following Dokra's crude map, the beauty gave way to wrongness.

The birds fell silent first. Then the insects. Soon, the only sounds were their wagon wheels grinding through fallen leaves and their own breathing, unconsciously held shallow as if the very air might carry contagion.

"Captain, what kind of healer walks toward death?" Halden asked, his voice muffled by the cloth mask they'd all donned as a precaution. The question had been building in him for miles, pressing against his training like a splinter.

"The kind who understands it," Thorne replied, his gaze fixed on the narrowing road ahead where brambles had begun to reclaim the path.

"Death is the enemy," Halden stated with the certainty of someone who'd been taught this truth since his first day of medical training. "Everything we do, every skill we learn, is to defeat it."

"Death is inevitable," Thorne countered gently. "It comes for everyone—king and beggar, soldier and healer. The only choice is whether we face it with dignity or fear. Suffering, though... suffering isn't inevitable. That's what can be fought."

"That's... dark," Venn muttered from his position at the wagon's rear, hand never straying far from his sword hilt.

"That's Aldwin," Thorne said simply. "He sees the world different from most. Sees death as a doorway, not a wall. Says the real tragedy isn't dying—it's dying alone, afraid, in agony, without meaning."

Veyra, who had been silent for most of the journey, finally spoke. Her voice carried the weight of personal experience, each word chosen with care. "In the canyon, I watched my friends burn. Watched them scream until their throats gave out, then watched them continue screaming silently. There was no mercy, no dignity, no meaning to it. Just pain and then nothing." She paused, her scarred hands tightening on the wagon's bench. "If this man can offer peace when all else is lost... that's a skill worth more than any sword. That's the difference between dying and being destroyed."

The philosophical debate ended as they crested a hill and saw it below—the village of Oakhaven, surrounded by a hastily erected barricade of sharpened stakes and yellow warning flags. The Lords' mark of quarantine was painted in tar on a massive sign: a black skull with "PLAGUE – DEATH TO THOSE WHO ENTER" beneath it. Beyond the barricade, no smoke rose from chimneys despite the evening chill. No movement in the streets. It was a village holding its breath, waiting for death to finish its work.

The theoretical had become viscerally real.

They left the wagon outside the barricade, tying the horses where they could graze but not wander. The barrier itself was more symbol than substance—anyone determined could climb over or through it. Its real power was fear.

"Last chance to reconsider," Veyra said quietly, looking at each of her companions.

"We've come this far," Halden replied, though his face was pale above his mask.

"Together," Thorne added simply.

They crossed the barricade into a world of unnatural silence. Oakhaven had been a prosperous village once—neat cottages with thatched roofs, a market square with a well-maintained fountain, gardens that had probably bloomed with pride. Now it was a careful arrangement of the dying. Bodies wrapped in stained sheets lay in neat rows outside homes, waiting for a burning that might never come. The few windows with candles were marked with red X's—houses of the infected, still clinging to life.

The smell hit them even through their masks—sweet rot and sour fever-sweat, the copper of blood and the acrid tang of bile. It was the smell of bodies failing, systems shutting down one by one.

From the largest building—a barn converted with obvious haste into a hospice—they heard something unexpected: singing. Not strong or beautiful, but persistent. A low, steady hum that might have been a lullaby or a hymn, the words lost but the melody continuing like a heartbeat.

They approached the open doorway and stopped, taking in the scene within.

-->

The barn's interior had been transformed with careful purpose. Cots lined both walls in neat rows, each with a small table beside it holding water, cloth, and personal effects—a child's toy here, a wedding ring there, small anchors to identity in the face of dissolution. Lanterns hung from the rafters, their warm light fighting back the gray pallor of disease. The singing came from the patients themselves, those who still could, maintaining the melody in shifts as voices failed and recovered.

And moving among them with unhurried grace was a small figure in robes that had probably been cream-colored once but were now stained with the evidence of countless hours of care. A halfling, his movements deliberate and calm, as if he had all the time in the world despite the death surrounding him.

They watched as Aldwin Gentleheart—for it could be no one else—knelt beside a cot where an old woman lay, her breathing shallow and liquid. He didn't rush. Didn't check her pulse with clinical efficiency. Instead, he simply took her hand and waited until her eyes focused on him.

"What's your name, dear one?" he asked, his voice warm as summer sunshine, clear enough to carry to the doorway.

"Mara," she rasped, the word costing her visible effort.

"Mara," he repeated, as if tasting the name, finding its flavor. "A beautiful name. It means 'bitter' in the old tongue, did you know that?"

"Fitting... for the end," she whispered, attempting a smile that became a grimace.

"Or the beginning," he countered gently, producing a small cloth to wipe the sweat from her brow with practiced tenderness. "Bitter makes the sweet sweeter. The first breath after drowning is the sweetest air. The first warmth after winter's cold is the most welcome fire."

"There's... no sweet left," she managed, tears tracking down her hollowed cheeks.

Aldwin reached into his satchel and withdrew a small bronze brazier, no larger than a teacup. With economical movements, he lit it, adding pinches of herbs that released a sweet, complex smoke—lavender and something earthy, mint and perhaps sage. The scent cut through the hospice's miasma like a blade of memory.

"There's this moment," he said, beginning to prepare tea with the same deliberate ritual Thorne remembered from the war. Each movement was precise but unhurried—warming the cup with hot water, measuring leaves with careful attention, pouring in a spiral pattern that seemed almost hypnotic. "This breath. This heartbeat. That's sweet enough for anyone, if we pay attention to it."

"Will it... hurt?" she asked, and everyone watching knew she wasn't asking about the tea.

"No, dear one," he said, his voice carrying absolute certainty, the kind that came not from hope but from experience. "I promise you, it won't hurt. It will be like falling asleep in your mother's arms after a long day's play. Warm and safe and loved."

"I... I'm afraid," she admitted, her fingers tightening weakly on his.

He squeezed back, his touch anchor-steady. "I know. Fear is the mind's way of saying goodbye. It's natural as breathing. But I'm here. You're not alone. You won't be alone for even a moment."

"Tell my son—" she began, urgency giving her voice momentary strength.

"I'll tell him you loved him," Aldwin promised, lifting the cup to her lips. "That you thought of him at the end. That you wanted him to remember your smile, not this moment. That you said his name like a blessing."

She sipped the tea, and something shifted in her expression—tension leaving her face like water from a broken dam. "It tastes like... like spring," she whispered, wonder in her voice. "Like the morning Thomas proposed by the old oak. Like... like beginning."

Her breathing steadied, slowed, gentled. The ragged, painful rasp became something softer. Her eyes remained on Aldwin's face as he began to hum—joining the barn's continuing melody—and gradually, peacefully, like a candle burning down to nothing, she stopped.

The silence that followed was profound, but not empty. It was the silence of completion, of a sentence properly ended rather than cut short.

Halden let out a sharp, involuntary breath that was nearly a sob. "You... you killed her," he whispered, his voice cracking with shock and something that might have been betrayal. Everything in his training, every instinct, screamed against what he'd witnessed.

Aldwin looked up, his eyes ancient in his young-seeming face. There was no guilt there, no defensiveness—only a deep, abiding sadness that had worn grooves in his soul. "I freed her," he said quietly.

"That's not medicine!" Halden protested, taking a step forward as if to physically intervene in something already complete.

"No," Aldwin agreed, rising slowly, his knees creaking from hours of kneeling. "It's mercy. Medicine fights disease. Mercy acknowledges when the fight is over and chooses compassion over prolonged suffering."

"Brother Aldwin," Veyra said, stepping into the barn, her voice soft but carrying the authority of someone who understood necessary choices.

Aldwin turned, and a small smile creased his weathered face—the first hint of anything beyond gentle sorrow they'd seen. "Veyra Thornwake. I heard you walked through fire for strangers."

"And you walk through plague for the same," she replied, moving closer despite the obvious risk.

"We each have our paths," he said with a slight shrug that somehow conveyed both humility and purpose. "Though I admit, I didn't expect mine to cross with yours again, Thorne."

"Hello, Brother," Thorne said, emotion thick in his voice. "It's been too long."

"Has it?" Aldwin asked, but his eyes were warm. "Time moves strangely in places like this. Days feel like years, years like moments." He gestured to the barn full of dying. "As you can see, I've been keeping busy."

"We need you, Brother," Thorne said, cutting to the heart of it.

"For what?" Aldwin asked, his gaze moving across the cots where several patients watched with fever-bright eyes. "To abandon these people in their final hours? My place is here."

"Your place is wherever suffering exists," Veyra corrected gently. "And there's more suffering than just this plague. We're building something—a company dedicated to pulling people from their darkest moments. But we're learning that rescue isn't enough. People need healing after. They need what you offer."

"You save souls," she continued when he remained silent. "That's harder and more necessary than saving lives."

"Most don't see it that way," he murmured, his fingers unconsciously moving to the tea service he'd used for Mara. "Most see what your medic sees—failure where there should be fighting."

"We're not most," Thorne said firmly. "We've all walked through our own deaths, one way or another. We know the value of what you do."

Aldwin looked around the quiet barn, at the faces of those he'd been comforting. Several of the more cognizant patients were nodding, making gentle shooing gestures.

"Go," one man wheezed. "We've had... our comfort. Others need... you now."

"My work here is almost done," Aldwin said with quiet certainty. "But peacefully. The village healer—she died yesterday—taught her daughter enough. They'll manage the end."

He gathered his few possessions—the tea service wrapped carefully in oiled cloth, his herb collection in labeled jars, a journal worn soft with use, and surprisingly, a small defensive blade that looked well-maintained despite probably never being drawn in anger.

"I'm ready," he announced, though his eyes lingered on the barn that had been his world for seven days.

They spent that night in the plague village, against all sense and safety. But somehow, it felt necessary—a commitment made not just to Aldwin but to the principle he represented. 

Halden, his medical training warring with what he witnessed, gradually found himself drawn into Aldwin's work. He watched the halfling prepare each tea with meticulous care, varying the herbs based on the patient's needs—more poppy for those in pain, lavender for the anxious, mint for those struggling to breathe.

"It's not just the herbs, is it?" Halden asked quietly, helping to support an elderly man while Aldwin administered the brew.

"No," Aldwin confirmed. "The herbs help, but the ritual matters more. The careful attention, the beauty of the ceremony even here—it tells them they matter. That their death matters. That someone will remember."

Through the night, they witnessed three more passages. Each one Aldwin attended with the same unhurried grace, learning names, listening to final words, ensuring no one crossed that threshold alone or afraid. Venn stood watch, Thorne helped move bodies with military reverence, and Veyra simply sat with the living, her scarred presence somehow comforting—proof that survival, however marked, was possible.

As dawn approached, painting the sky the color of hope and flame, only three patients remained, and these were sleeping peacefully, their breathing no longer the tortured rasp of the plague's grip.

"The others?" Veyra asked.

"Will pass within the day," Aldwin said with quiet certainty. "But peacefully. The village healer—she died yesterday—taught her daughter enough. They'll manage the end."

He gathered his few possessions—the tea service wrapped carefully in oiled cloth, his herb collection in labeled jars, a journal worn soft with use, and surprisingly, a small defensive blade that looked well-maintained despite probably never being drawn in anger.

The journey back to Waterdeep was marked by the strange lightness that follows intense experience. The morning air tasted sweet after the plague village's miasma, and even their exhaustion felt clean somehow. Aldwin rode a sturdy pony they'd procured from the village's abandoned stable, his small frame dwarfed by the packed supplies but sitting with surprising grace.

The silence lasted until they were well clear of the quarantine zone, the yellow flags disappearing behind the Westwood's embrace. It was Venn who broke it, pulling alongside the halfling to offer a piece of dried jerky from his rations.

"It's not much, Brother, but it's better than plague rations."

Aldwin accepted it with a gentle smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes. "Thank you, friend. A kindness is never a small thing, especially from a stranger."

"Not strangers," Veyra corrected from her position at the wagon's reins. "Not anymore."

They rode on for another mile, the sun climbing higher, burning away the morning mist. The normal sounds of the world were returning—birds calling, insects buzzing, the distant low of cattle from some hidden farm. Life continuing its ancient rhythm.

Finally, Halden spoke, his voice tentative but determined. He'd been wrestling with his thoughts since witnessing that first peaceful death, trying to reconcile everything he'd been taught with what he'd seen.

"Brother Gentleheart... back in the village," he began, choosing his words like a man picking his way through a minefield. "What you did for that woman, for all of them... I'm a medic. I was trained to fight for every last breath, to see every death as a failure. The academy taught us that surrendering to death was betraying our oath. How do you... reconcile what you do with the duty to heal?"

Aldwin was quiet for a long moment, his gaze on the horizon where Waterdeep's towers would soon appear. When he spoke, his voice carried the weight of years of similar questions, self-doubt conquered through experience rather than philosophy.

"A worthy question, Halden, and one I asked myself many times before finding peace with the answer." He shifted slightly in his saddle, settling into teaching mode—something in his bearing suggesting this was a familiar role. "Tell me, when you set a broken bone, do you simply force it back into place?"

"No," Halden replied, confused by the tangent. "You have to assess the break first, sometimes clean the wound, align it properly—"

"Exactly," Aldwin interrupted gently. "You cause pain to prevent greater suffering. You acknowledge that healing sometimes requires difficult choices. My duty is not to the breath, but to the person drawing it. I fight with all my skill, everything I've learned, for every life that can still be *lived*—where there's hope not just for survival but for meaningful existence after."

He paused, letting that sink in before continuing. "But when all that remains is agony that eclipses everything else, when the disease has won and will take its victory slowly and cruelly... my duty shifts. I no longer fight the ending, because that fight would be for my comfort, not theirs. Instead, I can make the passage gentle. Suffering is the enemy, my friend, not death. Death is merely a doorway we all must pass through. Suffering is the thief that robs that passage of dignity."

"So... it's a mercy," Venn said, his voice uncharacteristically subdued. "Like putting down a horse with a broken leg, but... with more respect."

Aldwin nodded, though his expression suggested the comparison was imperfect. "It's a choice a soldier sometimes has to make on the battlefield," Thorne added, his voice firm with personal experience. "A hard one. To end a comrade's suffering when there's no hope, when leaving them means a slow death in agony. Brother Aldwin just has the courage and skill to do it with compassion instead of a blade."

Veyra had been listening intently, her scarred hands steady on the reins. When she spoke, her voice carried absolute conviction. "You don't just save people from death, Brother Gentleheart. You save them from dying alone, afraid, and in agony. You transform an ending into a completion. That is not a failure to heal. That *is* healing—perhaps the deepest kind. And it is exactly what we need at the heart of what we're building."

"The Last Light Company," Aldwin mused, testing the name. "A light for those in darkness. Yes, I can see the need for such a thing. The world creates more darkness daily."

"Will you help us hold up that light?" Thorne asked.

"I've been holding it alone for some time," Aldwin replied with a small smile. "It would be good to share the weight."

That evening, as they made camp still a half-day from Waterdeep, Aldwin quietly unpacked his tea service. The bronze brazier caught the firelight as he lit it, the familiar ritual beginning again but in a new context. He prepared the brew with the same meticulous care he'd shown in the plague barn, but this time the herbs were different—mint and chamomile, honey and something that smelled of home.

As he poured the steaming, fragrant liquid into small ceramic cups—he seemed to have exactly enough for everyone, as if he'd known—he saw the hesitant looks on their faces. The last tea they'd seen him serve had ushered someone into death.

A small, knowing smile touched his lips, and his eyes skyrocketed with the first real humor they'd seen from him. "Don't worry," he said, his voice warm with gentle mischief. "It's just mint. I save the special blends for special occasions. This is simply for sharing, for marking the beginning of something new."

Veyra accepted her cup first, raising it slightly in a toast. "To the healer who understands that sometimes the greatest medicine is presence."

"To the company that's learning rescue means more than just pulling people from danger," Aldwin responded, raising his own cup.

"To the light that burns even in plague villages," Thorne added.

"To the crazy bastards who walk into them," Venn contributed, earning a laugh from everyone.

"To mercy," Halden said quietly, understanding dawning in his eyes. "The hardest healing of all."

They drank together as the stars emerged overhead, and for the first time since the canyon, Veyra felt something she'd thought lost forever—the warmth of belonging, of purpose shared with others who understood that sometimes the greatest strength was knowing when to be gentle.

The Last Light Company had found its healer. More importantly, it had found its heart.
