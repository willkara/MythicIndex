Departure preparations reveal the team's tension and resolve. Darric's forced exclusion highlights the mission's critical nature, while the wagon's departure symbolizes a journey into uncertainty. The visual of Waterdeep's walls receding captures the narrative's transition from static planning to active pursuit.

The Westwood Road scene suggests an emerging dynamic between Veyra, Thorne, and Halden, with unspoken interactions and mounting anticipation for their healer recruitment mission.

The forest's eerie silence becomes a harbinger of impending danger. An autumn canopy of gold and rust frames their approach to Oakhaven, where the quarantine barricade transforms their theoretical mission into a stark, visceral reality. The skull sign and abandoned landscape signal the profound human cost of the unfolding plague.

Entering the village reveals a haunting tableau: bodies wrapped in stained sheets lie in meticulously arranged rows, red X marks scarring windows like silent warnings. The converted barn-hospice becomes a unexpected sanctuary, where faint singing emerges - a delicate thread of hope amid overwhelming desolation.

Aldwin moves through the space with deliberate, unhurried grace, performing a precise tea ceremony beside Mara. His bronze brazier, small as a teacup, becomes a focal point of ritual and mercy. When Halden accuses "You killed her", Aldwin's calm response - "I freed her" - reveals a profound understanding of compassion beyond simple survival.

The scene pulses with quiet tension: Mara's peaceful passing, eyes locked on Aldwin's face; the smoke cutting through disease's miasma; whispered accusations and measured responses creating a complex emotional landscape of survival and dignity.

Throughout the night, Veyra's scarred presence transforms from potential threat to unexpected comfort. She sits among the living, her body a testament to survival's brutal mathematics. Thorne moves bodies with military precision, while Venn stands vigilant guard against further darkness.

As dawn paints the sky in hope's flame-like hues, Aldwin carefully gathers his possessions - tea service, herbs, journal, blade - each item a fragment of a journey marked by profound human choices.

The road from Oakhaven carries a different weight now. Morning air tastes of renewal after plague's miasma, with Aldwin perched small but resolute on his pony, surrounded by supplies that speak of continued purpose.

The evening's tea ceremony becomes a ritual of connection, not mercy. Under starlight, raised cups symbolize something deeper than survival - a collective heartbeat of the Last Light Company finding its true rhythm.

Key moments crystallize: Aldwin's knowing smile, the shared herbs, the philosophical discussions that transform simple travel into a journey of meaning. Each gesture builds toward understanding - not just of survival, but of shared humanity.

The most potent symbol emerges in those quiet moments around the fire, where ritual transcends mere survival and becomes a testament to resilience. Firelight, emerging stars, and shared cups tell a story beyond words.

The quarantine barricade represents more than physical defense - it's a psychological threshold where hope and terror intersect. Skull signs and yellow warning flags create a stark landscape of impending challenge, marking the group's irreversible commitment.

Rows of carefully arranged bodies speak volumes about dignity in the face of overwhelming loss. Red X marks on windows, stained sheets waiting for burning - these are not just details, but a silent narrative of community's last desperate acts of compassion.

The tea ceremony transforms trauma into connection. Firelight, raised cups, and Aldwin's wry humor weave disparate individuals into a unified purpose. This ritual becomes a profound healing moment, redefining survival not as mere endurance, but shared renewal.

Veyra's nighttime vigil embodies quiet resilience. Her presence among survivors suggests a profound commitment to witnessing, to holding space when words fail and hope trembles.

Her scarred hands tracing a child's drawing reveal a tender vulnerability beneath her hardened exterior. The contrast between her battle-marked fingers and innocent artwork speaks to her preserved humanity, a delicate testament to survival's complexity.

The scene's emotional weight centers on connection - how even a commander carries fragments of hope and gentleness. Her touch becomes a silent narrative of resilience, transforming physical scars into a map of survival and compassion.

The medical interaction reveals vulnerability, with the dwarven healer's clinical approach contrasting the intimate moment of treatment. Visual details highlight the patient's physical journey, showing healing as both physical and emotional restoration.

Mara's gaze lingering on Aldwin's face captures a profound transition. Her focused eyes and the soft candlelight suggest a moment of deep trust and peaceful acceptance, symbolizing a transformative threshold of connection.

Aldwin's careful preparation reflects his entire existence - gathering a few meaningful possessions like tea service, herb jars, journal, and a hidden blade, representing a quiet yet deliberate departure.

His life as a traveling healer emerges through these carefully selected items, embodying a profound commitment to service and compassionate transition.

The barn interior reveals Aldwin's character through its meticulously maintained space - cots with personal effects, lanterns casting gentle light, and a collective melody sustaining humanity amid suffering. This environment becomes a powerful testament to order emerging from chaos.

For scene selection, I'm prioritizing moments that illuminate the healer's journey:
1. Veyra's scarred fingers tracing a child's drawing
2. First glimpse of the quarantine barricade
3. Bodies arranged in precise, respectful rows

These scenes capture the emotional landscape of care, transformation, and quiet dignity.

The key moments trace a progression from intimate personal trauma through systemic challenge to collective human experience. Each scene reveals layers of Veyra's healing mission - from individual connection to broader humanitarian response.

I'm scrutinizing the potential redundancy between Veyra's vigil and Aldwin's hero moment. They share spatial and temporal proximity, which risks narrative overlap. The challenge is distinguishing their unique emotional and thematic contributions to the story's healing arc.

Analyzing the moments reveals critical differences: Aldwin focuses on ceremonial ritual with the dying, while Veyra embodies quiet solidarity with survivors. Her presence symbolizes resilience - her physical scars demonstrate survival's possibility, offering silent hope to those recovering from trauma.

The scenes, though geographically and chronologically adjacent, represent distinct emotional landscapes. Moments 4 and 5 are confirmed as separate scenes, ensuring narrative diversity. I'm confident in maintaining six moments that capture the chapter's emotional progression.
