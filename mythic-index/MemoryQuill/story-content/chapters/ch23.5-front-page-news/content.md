> "Success in the public eye is a double-edged gift. Competence displayed becomes competence expected, and those who prove themselves capable of solving one problem inevitably find themselves handed every problem that follows. Achievement brings opportunity—but it also brings the focused attention of those who would prefer problems remain unsolved."

*The Chronicle's printing room, evening of the rescue*

The ink was still wet when Master Aldrich Quillworth held up the broadsheet, his weathered fingers careful not to smudge the urgent typeset. Around him, the Chronicle's printing room hummed with the controlled chaos of breaking news.

"Read me the headline, Tamsin," he called to his senior reporter, a sharp-eyed woman with ink-stained cuffs.

"'SPECIALIST SKILLS PROVE DECISIVE IN GREAT LIBRARY RESCUE,'" she began, her voice carrying over the mechanical sounds.

"And the lead?"

"'The Last Light Company, Waterdeep's provisional civic asset for special rescue, lived up to its purpose today, extracting a trapped scholar from the ruins of the Great Library in a fraction of the time conventional methods would have required. Master Cassius Valerius was rescued in just under six hours from a scene the City Watch had deemed too unstable for a standard, non-specialist recovery operation.'"

Aldrich nodded approvingly. The article painted a picture not of magic, but of method. It detailed how the City Watch had correctly identified the situation as requiring unique expertise and made the call to bring in the Company. It highlighted Grimjaw Ironbeard's "surgical" approach to debris removal and Rill Vossari's "efficient management of floodwaters" that allowed the rescue to proceed.

The story's power wasn't in myth, but in professionalism. It quoted a Watch officer who praised the Company's seamless coordination. "They operate with a level of precision you rarely see outside of elite military units," the officer was quoted as saying. "Every member knew their role. No wasted time, no duplicated effort. They were in and out before our own engineers had finished their preliminary shoring calculations."

"The part about the crowd?" Aldrich asked.

"'A cheer erupted from the gathered crowd when the team emerged with Master Valerius. The mood was one of profound relief, and a testament to the city's wisdom in cultivating such specialized talent.'"

Aldrich smiled. It was a good story. It made the City Watch look smart for calling them in, and it made the Lords look smart for funding them. Most of all, it sold the public on the idea that competence, not just brute force, was what kept Waterdeep safe.

"Print run?" he asked his press master.

"Three thousand copies for the morning edition, sir."

"Make it four thousand. This is the kind of good news the city needs. Competence is a story worth telling."

*A tavern in the Dock Ward where working folk gather*

The Merchant's Rest was packed, the air thick with pipe smoke and the excited buzz of the day's events.

"I tell you, I saw it," declared Jorik One-Eye, a longshoreman. "That dwarf, Grimjaw—he didn't just smash his way in. He walked right up to that pile of stone, put a hand on it, and just... listened. Like he was checking its pulse."

"Listened to it?" scoffed Marta Cooperwright, the barrel-maker. "You've had too much ale, Jorik."

"I'm serious!" he insisted. "He stood there dead still for a minute, then pointed and said, 'That one.' His lads put their bars on one rock, gave a nudge, and the whole mess just... settled. Made a perfect tunnel, neat as you please. The city engineer near swallowed his own tongue."

"My cousin Bess was there," added Tam the carter. "She said the water mage—the blue-skinned one—didn't do some grand spell. She just sort of... coaxed the water. Guided it away from the rescue path. It was strange. Quiet-like, but it worked."

The crowd murmured appreciatively. These details felt realer than grand magic.

"And the commander?" asked a young woman. "The scarred one, Thornwake."

"All business," said an older man with carpenter's stains on his apron. "Stood there with the Watch captain, got the report, and sent her people in. You hear stories about her, sure—dragon fire, the canyon, all that. But today, she was just a professional getting a job done."

"That's what makes it impressive, ain't it?" nodded Jorik sagely. "It ain't about gods and monsters. It's about knowing your trade. And their trade is bringing people home."

"To a job well done!" called someone, raising a tankard.

"To a job well done!" the tavern roared back.

*Lady Argenthorne's salon, Castle Ward*

"One must admit, it was a tidy piece of work," observed Lord Caelynn Ravenshollow, swirling his brandy. "And a rather effective demonstration of their value, just as their provisional status comes under review."

"It was a calculated risk on the Watch's part," Lady Cordelia Blackmere noted, adjusting her jewelry. "Calling in a private company for such a high-profile incident. If they had failed, it would have reflected poorly on everyone. But since they succeeded, the Watch appears decisive and the Lords appear wise for funding them."

"Which raises the question of their autonomy," interjected Lord Aldric Thann. "They are not Watch, not military. They are a private entity with unique capabilities. Who directs them? To whom are they ultimately loyal?"

The room fell thoughtfully quiet.

"Their charter places them under the Lords' authority for civic matters," Lady Argenthorne said, her voice carrying the weight of carefully gathered intelligence. "But their operational command is their own. It's a delicate balance."

"For now," Lord Thann countered. "But such organizations have a tendency to attract... private contracts. What happens when a guild or a noble house hires them for a task that doesn't align with the city's interests? Their success today makes them a very powerful tool, and I should like to know who, precisely, will be wielding it."

The group exchanged knowing glances. The Last Light Company wasn't a threat, not yet. But they were a new and influential piece on the great board of Waterdeep politics, and their every move would be watched.

*City Watch headquarters, tactical briefing room*

"It was the right call," Captain Grimsby stated, his tone leaving no room for argument. He stood before a map of the library collapse in the tactical briefing room. "Our protocols for a collapse of this magnitude call for a slow, methodical shoring-and-clearing operation. Best case, we would have reached the victim in eighteen hours, with a significant risk of secondary collapse. It was too slow and too dangerous for our people."

Commander Atlock nodded from the head of the table. "And the Company?"

"They treated it like a targeted strike," Grimsby replied, with a grudging professional respect. "Their specialist, Ironbeard, bypassed the entire shoring process with a technique I've only read about in dwarven engineering texts. He identified the structural keystone and shifted it. Unorthodox, risky as hell, but it worked. It saved us a day and likely saved the scholar's life."

"Their other specialists performed to the same standard," he continued. "The genasi's water control prevented the lower levels from becoming a death trap. Their medic stabilized the victim on-site. Their command and control was seamless."

Lieutenant Colonel Vayne leaned back. "So, your assessment?"

"They are not a replacement for the Watch," Grimsby said firmly. "They are a specialized tool that we must learn how and when to deploy. They are the scalpel to our sword. Today, we needed a surgeon, and we made the right call."

"Agreed," said Atlock. "I want cross-training exercises scheduled. If they have techniques that can save lives, I want our people learning them."

*The Spire of Learning, evening faculty meeting*

"The practical application of keystone theory in a chaotic debris field is what's so fascinating," declared Professor Aldara Stoneforge of Engineering Studies. "It suggests a level of intuitive structural analysis that goes beyond our standard models. I've already begun drafting a proposal for a formal case study."

"The hydro-elemental interaction was similarly noteworthy," added Master Theron Wavelight. "Not a display of raw power, but of subtle guidance. It implies a cooperative paradigm. It's a technique worth documenting."

Professor Mirabelle Thornwick of Historical Analysis leaned forward. "What interests me is the command structure. We witnessed a successful deployment of what I'm terming 'specialist-deferred command.' Captain Grimsby of the Watch maintained strategic oversight of the scene, but deferred tactical methodology to the relevant expert on the ground. It's a highly effective model for inter-agency cooperation."

"A fascinating case study indeed," Master Cordelia Brightwater, the Spire's senior magical theorist, concluded. "A reminder that theory and practice are often two very different things. We should endeavor to learn what we can from this."

The consensus was clear. The rescue was not a miracle to be awed by, but a complex event to be studied, documented, and learned from.

*Location unknown, Silent Hand operatives*

The chamber was windowless and unremarkable. Three figures sat around a scarred wooden table, their faces obscured by deep hoods.

"The reports are consistent," said the first figure. "The Last Light Company's reputation for efficiency grows. Today's rescue has solidified their position with the City Watch and the Lords."

"They are becoming an obstacle," said the second, his voice a low whisper. "Their tracker, the Moonwhisper girl, has been asking questions near the northern routes. Now they have the trust of the Watch. The Shepherd will need to be informed. This complicates our timeline."

"Direct action against them is foolish," said the third figure, a woman with a cultured accent. "It would make them martyrs. But their very competence makes them predictable. They respond to crises. They follow leads. They can be... guided."

She slid a map across the table, circling a district far from their current operations. "If a new crisis were to emerge, something that demands their unique talents, it would draw their attention. And their resources."

The whisper-voiced man considered it. "A diversion."

"More than that," the woman replied. "An opportunity. To study their methods. To identify their weaknesses. And to remind them that there are more dangers in this city than collapsing buildings."

The candle flickered, casting their shadows long across the walls. The Last Light Company had earned the city's respect today. But in doing so, they had also earned the focused, analytical attention of its most dangerous enemies.
