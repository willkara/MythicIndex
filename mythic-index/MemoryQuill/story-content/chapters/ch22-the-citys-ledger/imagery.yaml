      CHAPTER 22 VARIATIONS (TRAUMA REVELATION ARC):
      - SCENE 02 (The Trigger): Composed commander suddenly stricken—color draining from face,
        papers scattering from nerveless fingers, wide eyes recognizing the name Cassius Valerius.
        Professional calm shattering in an instant.
      - SCENE 03 (The Breakdown): Slumped in chair, gray pallor, cold sweat on forehead.
        Tears finally breaking free as she speaks of Lysander. Hands clenching and unclenching
        with physical memory of digging. Stomach heaving at the weight of memory.
      - SCENE 04 (Recovery): Spine straightening, trembling stopped by force of will.
        Touching lantern for strength. Commander Thornwake restored—the vulnerable woman
        compartmentalized for later.
      - Throughout: Dark mohawk with feathered braids, burn scar on left face, tattoos on
        neck and arms, weatherworn leather coat, battered metal lantern at hip that glows
        with soft gold light.

          The industrial space of Building A transformed by emotional weight. Chairs
          scraped across concrete to form a protective circle around the stricken commander.
          High clerestory windows cast long afternoon shadows that seem to enfold the
          gathering, turning cold warehouse geometry into intimate sanctuary. The round
          map table pushed aside, the Briefing Circle becomes a space of confession and
          family support. Light falls in shafts through the lancets, pooling on faces
          wet with shared tears. The usual bustle is silenced—even the distant rhythm
          of Grimjaw's forge in Building B has stopped, as if the entire complex holds
          its breath.

          The transition space where the Company gathers gear for the rescue mission.
          Practical activity resuming after the emotional storm. Veyra stands here,
          spine straightened by will, touching her lantern for strength. The space
          represents the return to duty—the moment when Commander Thornwake reasserts
          control over the woman who wept for Lysander's memory.

      The warehouse briefing area, afternoon light slanting through high clerestory
      windows. Veyra stands frozen at the moment of impact—the name "Cassius Valerius"
      still hanging in the air. Papers flutter from her nerveless fingers, suspended
      mid-fall. Her face has gone pale beneath the burn scar, dark eyes wide with
      recognition and horror. The color drains visibly from her cheeks. Behind her,
      other Company members are beginning to turn, sensing catastrophe. A messenger
      in grey Castle livery stands uncertainly at the edge of frame, scroll in hand.

      Medium close-up on Veyra, slightly off-center. Papers caught mid-scatter create

      the falling papers and her expression in sharp focus. The moment of impact.

      The vast warehouse interior of Building A, transformed. High clerestory windows
      cast long diagonal shafts of afternoon light that fall across a loose circle
      of chairs. At the center, Veyra sits slumped, gray and shaken. Around her,
      the Company has gathered—Grimjaw's solid dwarven presence, Aldwin's gentle
      concern, Vera still weak but reaching out, Finn's young face stricken with
      empathy, Mistress Elba's grandmother fury at suffering, Fayne's quiet practicality,
      Rill's serene water-genasi calm. The industrial stone and timber recede into
      shadow, leaving only this pool of faces and light. The circle is imperfect,
      organic—people drawn by love, not formation.

      Ultra-wide hero shot emphasizing the circle geometry. Veyra at center but
      slightly lower than surrounding figures, emphasizing vulnerability and protection.
      Light shafts create visual structure, falling across different faces. The industrial

      The full circle visible, faces turned toward Veyra at center. Each person
      shows their own version of the same resolve—Grimjaw's solid certainty,
      Aldwin's gentle determination, Vera's knowing nod, Finn's fierce young
      loyalty. The warehouse architecture rises above them, but they are the
      focus. Light falls across them like a benediction.

      Wide shot showing full circle geometry. Veyra at center, the axis around
      which everyone is oriented. Multiple faces at different depths and lighting
      conditions create visual interest. The industrial architecture frames but
      doesn't dominate.

      The talisman that anchors her. Veyra's hand touching the lantern—
      drawing strength from its familiar weight, from its connection to
      survival, from its soft gold light that never went out. The symbol
      of her endurance becoming the source of her renewed strength.

      Close-up of Veyra's scarred hand touching her battered metal lantern
      at her hip. The flame inside pulses warm and steady, casting soft
      gold light on her fingers. The leather of her belt and coat visible.
      Her hand is calloused and scarred, but the touch is gentle—almost
      reverent. The lantern's metal is worn smooth from years of handling.

      Tight portrait framing on hand and lantern. The flame's glow provides
