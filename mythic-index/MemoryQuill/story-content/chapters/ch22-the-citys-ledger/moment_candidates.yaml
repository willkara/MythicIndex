    source_excerpts:
      - "But instead of dispersing, the Company instinctively drew closer to their stricken commander. Chairs were quietly moved across the concrete floor, the scraping sounds echoing in the cavernous space as they formed a loose circle around where Veyra sat slumped in Grimjaw's steady grip."
      - "The high windows cast long shadows that seemed to enfold their small gathering, transforming the industrial coldness into something unexpectedly intimate."
    
    selection_rationale: "The CHARACTER moment of the chapter. This is where the Company reveals who they ARE—not through dialogue but through the physical act of drawing close. The composition (warm intimate cluster against vast cold space) visualizes the chapter's core theme: family forged from shared wounds."

    narrative_beat: "After the confession and commitment, Veyra sits alone a moment longer. She watches her hands tremble, then touches her lantern. The flame pulses once, warm and steady. She rises, forcing her spine straight, the commander returning."
    subtext: "The dead light her way. The flame is memory made useful."

    source_excerpts:
      - "Veyra touched her lantern briefly, drawing strength from its familiar weight at her hip. The flame inside seemed to pulse once, warm and steady."
      - "She rose, forcing her spine straight, forcing her breathing to steady. Grimjaw caught her eye from across the room and gave the slightest nod—not of pity, but of understanding."
      - "Commander Thornwake was back in control. The woman who had wept for Lysander's memory could wait."
    
    selection_rationale: "The closing symbol shot. After the emotional storm, this moment of private resolve completes the arc. The lantern—Veyra's signature item, her connection to the fallen—becomes the visual anchor for her transformation from broken survivor back to capable commander. The intimate framing contrasts with the wide circle shot, bookending the confession sequence."
