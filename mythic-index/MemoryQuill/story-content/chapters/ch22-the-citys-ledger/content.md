Two weeks of intelligence gathering had yielded some progress, but still too many unknowns. The core team was gathered around the Briefing Circle in the main warehouse—no longer dusty and chaotic, but organized and functional after their settling-in period.

"We've learned about their defenses, but we're still missing crucial pieces," Thorne said, tracing the outer wall with a practiced finger. "Without more information about the water systems Rill analyzed, we're planning blind."

Veyra stared at the drawing, her arms crossed. "We need a way in that avoids their main defenses. The water tunnels are our best option, but—"

A weak but clear voice echoed from the cavernous entrance behind them.

"...but you need someone who understands how water wants to flow."

Every head snapped up. Chairs scraped against the concrete floor. Standing in the doorway, leaning heavily on a staff and the steadying arm of Rill Vossari, was Vera Moonwhisper. She was pale, thinner, and moved with careful deliberation, but her eyes held their familiar sharp intelligence.

For a heartbeat, there was stunned silence. Then, "Vera!" Finn's joyous shout broke the spell, and the room erupted.

The reunion was a flood of unrestrained emotion. Finn reached her first, stopping just short of a hug he clearly wanted to give. "We were so worried! The druids wouldn't let us visit after the first week, and—"

"I'm fine, Finn," Vera said gently, though she swayed slightly.

Mistress Elba bustled over, her dwarven stature somehow making her presence larger as she fussed immediately. "Fine nothing! You're skin and bones, child. When did you last eat properly? Those druids and their vegetable broths—that's not food for recovery! Stone's teeth, you look worse than my grandson Kili after his first week at the mines."

Fayne appeared with a chair, quietly practical as always, sliding it behind Vera just as her legs began to tremble. "The walk from the grove was longer than you expected?"

"Perhaps," Vera admitted, sinking gratefully into the seat.

Grimjaw stomped over from his forge, looking her up and down with a critical eye. "Hmph. Thought you'd still be howling at the moon," he grumbled, the closest he could get to saying *I missed you*. "Good to see you on two feet."

Veyra embraced her carefully but fiercely. "The druids finally released you?"

"After two and a half weeks, they finally cleared me for light duty," Vera replied with a weak smile. "Rill volunteered to keep an eye on me and help with the transition back." She gestured to her companion. "I believe some of you met her during your visit to the grove?"

"Good to see you again, Rill," Aldwin said warmly, stepping forward. Marcus nodded his greeting, remembering their productive conversation about water systems.

For those who hadn't visited the grove—Finn, Grimjaw, Fayne, and the others—Vera made introductions. "This is Rill Vossari. She's been helping with my recovery, and she knows more about water magic than anyone I've met."

Rill offered a serene bow to the group. "Vera has told me much about all of you. Your headquarters has... excellent ventilation," she observed diplomatically, taking in the organized space with its established work areas.

"It's an improvement," Vera added, her voice still slightly raspy. "The last one had too many holes in the walls."

The dark humor broke the last of the tension, and weary laughter rippled through the group. Vera slowly made her way to the table, Echo swooping down from somewhere in the rafters to land on her shoulder with a gentle caw.

"I'm not cleared for combat duty," Vera said, cutting off the inevitable questions. "But I can advise. And more importantly, Rill has been studying the water patterns around that facility for days now."

The team gathered around the table, the joy of the reunion settling into focused professionalism. Rill was just beginning to point out specific intake points on their map when a sharp, official rap echoed from the main door.

All heads turned. A man in the crisp, grey livery of a Castle Waterdeep functionary stepped hesitantly inside, clutching a scrolled parchment. He blinked, his gaze sweeping over the collection of scarred warriors before finding Thorne.

"Captain Brightward," the clerk said, his voice tight. "A directive from the Lords' Committee for Civic Security. There has been a structural failure at the Great Library. A section has collapsed into the sub-archives, trapping Master Cassius Valerius, a senior scholar. The city engineers have deemed it beyond their purview."

The sound that escaped Veyra's lips was sharp and involuntary—a gasp that cut through the warehouse like a blade. The papers in her hands scattered to the floor as she stared at the messenger with wide, stricken eyes.

Every head in the room turned toward her. Thorne's gaze snapped from the clerk to his commander, instantly recognizing that something was very wrong.

"Messenger," Thorne said, his voice carrying the weight of military authority. "Confirm that name. Slowly and clearly."

The clerk blinked, startled by the sudden intensity in the room. "Master Cassius Valerius of House Valerius, Captain. Senior researcher in the Antiquities and Genealogies section."

The confirmation hit Veyra like a physical blow. She stumbled backward, her hand grasping for something to hold onto. The world tilted sideways, and suddenly she wasn't in the warehouse anymore.

*She was back in the canyon. Lysander's face, streaked with blood and dust, determined even as the ceiling pressed down on his shield. He could see it all—the blocked exits, the inevitable collapse. His eyes met hers, and impossibly, he smiled. "Live," he said, just that one word. Then louder: "GO! Veyra, GO! Take them and GO!"*

*The sound of stone grinding against metal. The smell of sulfur and charred flesh. Ignis's screams behind the wall of molten glass.*

Grimjaw reached her first, his thick arms catching her before she hit the floor. "Easy, Commander. Easy now." His voice was a low rumble, steadying.

She sank into the nearest chair that someone—Fayne?—pushed behind her, one hand pressed to her forehead, her breathing shallow and quick. Her skin had gone pale beneath the scars, a sheen of cold sweat breaking across her forehead. The strong, composed commander who had faced down Black Hawks and political machinations was suddenly, visibly shaken.

Aldwin moved immediately to her side, his healer's instincts kicking in, while Halden stepped closer with quiet concern.

From across the room, Rill watched with growing alarm. She'd seen this before—the way trauma could ambush someone when they least expected it. She moved closer to Vera, speaking quietly. "She needs grounding. The memory has her."

Vera, despite her own weakness, shifted forward. "Commander," she said, her voice carrying the steady rhythm of someone who understood being lost in dark memories. "Listen to my voice. You're in the warehouse. You're safe. Feel the chair beneath you, the floor under your feet." Across the room, Marcus watched with sharp eyes, clearly recognizing that something significant was happening but lacking the context to understand it.

"Continue," Thorne commanded the messenger, though his attention remained partially focused on Veyra. "What else do we need to know?"

The clerk, sensing the tension but pressing forward with his duties, unrolled the scroll. "As a Provisional Civic Asset, the Last Light Company is hereby directed to effect a rescue. The collapse occurred approximately two hours ago. Master Valerius was conducting research in the lower archives when the structural failure occurred. You have the full support of the City Watch in securing the perimeter."

"Timeline?" Thorne asked briskly, all business now.

"The Committee requests immediate response, Captain. Every hour increases the risk of further collapse."

"Understood." Thorne stepped forward, his bearing radiating professional competence despite the undercurrents in the room. "Inform the Committee that the Last Light Company accepts this contract and will be en route within the hour."

As the messenger turned to leave, Thorne's voice cut through the air with military precision. "Soldier." The man froze. "You will speak nothing of what you witnessed here. Only that we received the message and will respond. Are we clear?"

The authority in Thorne's voice was absolute—not threatening, but carrying the weight of unquestionable command. Even Marcus, accustomed to political power plays, found himself impressed by the sheer presence behind those words.

"Y-yes, Captain. Understood." The messenger nodded quickly and hurried out into the afternoon bustle of Waterdeep, moving noticeably faster than when he'd arrived.

The moment the door closed, the warehouse fell into heavy silence. All eyes were on Veyra, who remained slumped in her chair, struggling to compose herself. The revelation had shattered her professional calm, leaving her looking more vulnerable than any of them had ever seen.

The moment the door closed behind the messenger, the vast warehouse fell into heavy silence—even the distant rhythmic hammering from Grimjaw's forge in Building B had stopped, as if the entire complex held its breath. But instead of dispersing, the Company instinctively drew closer to their stricken commander. Chairs were quietly moved across the concrete floor, the scraping sounds echoing in the cavernous space as they formed a loose circle around where Veyra sat slumped in Grimjaw's steady grip. The high windows cast long shadows that seemed to enfold their small gathering, transforming the industrial coldness into something unexpectedly intimate.

Aldwin guided her to a slightly more comfortable position while Halden brought water. Vera, despite her own weakness, shifted her chair closer, and Rill followed. Finn moved forward with wide, concerned eyes, while Mistress Elba bustled near with the protective instincts of a grandmother who had raised three children, seven grandchildren, and now watched over this found family—someone who had seen too many people carry too much pain alone. Even Fayne, usually practical and distant, drew near with their notebook forgotten.

In the background, Kelen, Darric, and Venn stood quietly. They knew enough of the story to understand what was coming, but they positioned themselves as silent supporters—close enough to help, far enough to give her space.

Thorne caught Marcus's eye and nodded toward one of the makeshift offices. The diplomat understood immediately—there were political implications to discuss, but this moment belonged to the Company as a whole. They slipped away quietly as Veyra began to speak.

"Commander," Aldwin said gently, settling cross-legged on the floor beside her chair. "Take your time."

Veyra's hands were shaking slightly as she accepted the water. For a long moment, she simply stared at the cup, aware of the circle of faces around her—some knowing fragments, others understanding nothing yet. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper.

"Lysander had an older brother." She looked up at them, her eyes bright with unshed tears. "Cassius. Always buried in his books, even as children. While Lysander dreamed of adventure and heroism, Cassius dreamed of dusty libraries and ancient scrolls."

"The scholar we're going to rescue," Halden said quietly, understanding immediately.

Finn's young voice was full of confusion. "Who's Lysander?"

Vera answered softly. "The leader of Veyra's first company. The Gilded Compass."

"Lysander used to joke about it," Veyra continued, a sad smile flickering across her face. "Said Cassius was the one with the real courage—facing down centuries of accumulated knowledge every day, trying to make sense of it all. He... he was proud of his brother's work."

She paused, her hands clenching and unclenching as the memories surged. "When Lysander held up that ceiling... he could see it. Could see that we were all going to die. The exits were blocked, the whole mountain was coming down, but he looked right at me anyway. Right through me. And he smiled." Her voice broke slightly. "The mountain falling on him, his shield already cracking, and he smiled. Then he said one word. 'Live.' Just that. 'Live.' And he brought the ceiling down."

Grimjaw's breath caught slightly. He'd never heard the details before, only knew that something terrible had happened.

The words started pouring out, as if a dam had broken. Words she'd never spoken aloud, not even to Thorne.

"The first day after... I dug. But not at first. At first, I just watched them through the glass." Her voice became hollow, distant. "The explosion had fused the stone into a barrier. I could see everything—Borin trying to break through with his hammer, his hands bleeding. Elara... stopping. And I couldn't help. Couldn't reach them. Could only watch.

"Then I started digging. I used Lysander's shield—it was all I had. As a wedge, as a shovel, whatever I needed. My fingers bled. My nails tore off. But the shield... the shield held. Like he was still protecting us." Her hands clenched involuntarily. "I was convinced I could reach them. That somehow, if I just worked fast enough, they'd still be... but I could still hear the echoes of screaming, even though the screaming had stopped hours before."

From the back, Darric's voice was quiet but clear. "When we found you, you were still moving stones. Boulders twice your size."

Finn's face had gone pale. "You were alone? For how long?"

"Three days," Veyra answered, her voice growing distant. "Three days."

Mistress Elba made a small sound of dwarven distress, wringing her hands anxiously. "Child, you didn't eat anything? Drink anything? By my grandmother's rolling pin, three days without water..."

Veyra's skin had taken on a grayish pallor that alarmed Aldwin. "The second day, the thirst came. I hadn't brought water—why would I? It was supposed to be a day's expedition. The lantern... the lantern never went out. Three days, three nights. It became my only companion. I talked to it because there was nothing else left that still had light." She laughed, a broken sound. "I started seeing things. Lysander standing beside me, telling me to rest. Elara's ghost, picking the locks on doors that weren't there. Borin offering me water that turned to sand in my mouth."

Rill nodded with quiet understanding, her water genasi nature recognizing something deeper. "When the body loses its connection to water's flow... the spirit seeks it in other forms," she said softly.

"I knew they were hallucinations," Veyra continued, "but I talked to them anyway. What else was there to do?"

Her breathing had become irregular. Aldwin quietly prepared a calming draught, but didn't interrupt. Around the circle, faces showed different degrees of horror and understanding—Vera nodding with the recognition of someone who had lost control, Grimjaw's jaw set in protective anger, Finn looking like he might be sick.

"The third day, I finally accepted they were gone. That's when I found them—what was left. I... I gathered what I could. Made the markers." Her voice grew quieter, more fragmented. "But Ignis... I never found Ignis. Just a circle of scorched stone where he'd tried some desperate spell. Dead? Escaped? I don't know. I built him a cairn anyway, but it felt... empty."

She looked down at her scarred hands. "I carved their names. All four names. Cut myself with obsidian and wrote them in my own blood—on his shield, on the stone wall. Had to make them permanent. Had to make sure someone would know they existed." Her voice broke slightly. "I laid them on his shield. It became... everything. Tool, stretcher, altar. In the end, it was all they had for dignity."

From behind them, Venn spoke quietly. "The lantern was still burning when we arrived. You'd been feeding it for hours, piece by piece."

"I don't even remember the patrol finding me," Veyra admitted. "Thorne says I was still talking to the ghosts, asking Lysander if the markers were straight enough, if he approved."

Fayne's logical mind was struggling. "Three days... the timeline doesn't... how did you survive?"

She looked up at them, her eyes haunted. "Three days. Three days of absolute failure. I couldn't save them. Couldn't recover Ignis's body. Couldn't even die with them. Just... existed. Survived. And now his brother is trapped, and if I fail again—"

Her stomach suddenly heaved. She lurched forward, and Halden barely got a bucket to her in time. The physical reaction to the memories was violent, her body rejecting the weight of the trauma as surely as it would poison.

The circle tightened around her—Aldwin supporting her shoulders, Halden steadying the bucket, Vera's hand on her back, Rill quietly providing a damp cloth. Even Finn moved closer, his young face stricken with understanding.

"But he doesn't know," Veyra's voice cracked as she wiped her mouth. "Cassius doesn't know how his brother really died. The family... they think it was just another adventuring accident. They don't know about his sacrifice, about how he saved us all."

"Then we'll make sure they learn the truth," Halden said firmly, supporting her as the nausea passed. "After we bring him home safely."

Grimjaw, who had remained close throughout, spoke with unusual gentleness. "Commander, you're not in that canyon. You're here, with us. And this time, you're not alone. This time, we dig together."

From the back, Kelen added quietly, "All of us."

Vera reached over and squeezed Veyra's hand. "I know what it's like to carry the weight of survival when others didn't. But Grimjaw's right—you're not alone anymore."

Mistress Elba, tears in her amber eyes, bustled forward with the stubborn determination of a grandmother who would not be denied. "And you're going to eat a proper meal before we go anywhere, child. Can't rescue anyone if you collapse from hunger. Learned that feeding my own family through hard times—food first, everything else second."

Despite everything, Veyra managed a weak smile at that. The circle around her had transformed into something stronger—not just colleagues, but a family united by understanding their leader's deepest pain.

"This isn't just a civic duty anymore," she said, looking around at all of them.

"It never was," Aldwin replied with gentle certainty. "Everything we do honors those we've lost. Today, we get to honor Lysander by saving the family he loved."

Twenty minutes later, both groups reconvened at the central table. Veyra had composed herself, though the emotional weight was still visible in the set of her shoulders and the careful control of her expression. Marcus now understood the stakes, and the entire room held a different energy—this was no longer routine civic duty.

"The Last Light Company accepts this contract," Veyra announced, her voice steady but carrying undertones of personal determination. "We'll effect the rescue of Master Cassius Valerius."

Thorne stepped forward. "Equipment check. Grimjaw, structural assessment capabilities. Aldwin, Halden—full medical kit for potential trauma injuries. Darric, Venn—heavy lifting and debris clearing."

The team moved with practiced efficiency, but there was something different in their movements. Each member paused by Veyra's chair as they passed—Darric with a firm hand on her shoulder, Venn with a quiet nod, Fayne efficiently checking that she had water within reach. It was wordless support, but powerful in its simplicity. They'd all seen their commander's vulnerability, understood that this mission carried weight beyond their professional obligations.

"Commander, if I may... rescue operations have their own rhythm. Don't let the personal stakes rush your judgment. The best way to honor the dead is to bring the living home safely."

Veyra met her eyes, finding strength in the tracker's quiet wisdom. "Understood."

Rill, who had been observing the proceedings with the careful attention of someone learning new group dynamics, stepped forward. "The water analysis of the Silent Hand facility can wait. Lives take precedence over intelligence gathering."

"Thank you," Veyra said simply. "All of you. This... this means more than I can express."

Marcus moved to stand beside her as the team dispersed to gather their equipment. "Personal stakes can be a strength," he said quietly. "They can also be a weakness. The trick is knowing which one you're experiencing at any given moment."

"I know," Veyra replied, watching her people prepare with the fluid efficiency that marked them as professionals. "Today, it's strength. Today, we bring Lysander's brother home."

Outside the warehouse, the sounds of Waterdeep's afternoon continued their familiar patterns. But within the Last Light Company's headquarters, the mission that had started as civic obligation had transformed into something deeper—a chance for redemption, a way to honor the past while protecting the future.

They had proven themselves as warriors, as tacticians, as professionals. Now they would prove themselves as something more: the kind of people who would move heaven and earth to save a single life, especially when that life connected to someone they had loved and lost.

The rescue of Master Cassius Valerius would be many things—a test of their engineering capabilities, a demonstration of their civic value, a foundation for their growing reputation in Waterdeep.

But most importantly, it would be Veyra Thornwake's chance to finally save someone Lysander Valerius had cared about.

As the team dispersed to gather equipment, Veyra remained seated for a moment longer. Her hands, she noticed distantly, were trembling. She watched them shake against her thighs—these hands that had held dying friends, that had carved names into stone, that had dug through rubble until her nails tore away.

*Not now,* she told herself, clenching her fists until the trembling stopped. *The mission first. Fall apart later. You can fall apart later.*

She rose, forcing her spine straight, forcing her breathing to steady. Grimjaw caught her eye from across the room and gave the slightest nod—not of pity, but of understanding. He'd seen soldiers do this before. Compartmentalize. Box away the pain until the job was done.

Veyra touched her lantern briefly, drawing strength from its familiar weight at her hip. The flame inside seemed to pulse once, warm and steady.

*Hold it together,* she thought. *These people need you. Cassius needs you.*

She walked toward the equipment area, her stride betraying nothing of the storm inside. Commander Thornwake was back in control. The woman who had wept for Lysander's memory could wait.
