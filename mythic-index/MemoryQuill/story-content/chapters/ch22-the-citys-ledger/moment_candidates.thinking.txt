This is a detailed chapter analysis request for Chapter 22 "The City's Ledger". Let me analyze this chapter carefully through the Five Lenses framework.

## Chapter Summary
This chapter has multiple powerful scenes:
1. Vera returns from druidic healing with Rill Vossari
2. A messenger arrives with news that Cassius Valerius (brother of Lysander, Veyra's dead former leader) is trapped in a library collapse
3. Veyra has a complete emotional breakdown, revealing the full trauma of the Undershade Canyon incident
4. The Company rallies around her in a circle of support
5. They prepare for the rescue mission

- Also mentioned: Cassius Valerius (trapped scholar), Lysander Valerius (dead hero, memory), Commander Atlock (mentioned)

## Applying the Five Lenses to identify candidate moments:

### Scene 1 (scn-22-01): The Return
Potential moments:
1. **Vera appearing in the doorway** - medium emotional resonance, visual distinctiveness (pale, leaning on staff with Rill), some character revelation
2. **The reunion flood** - emotional but talking heads mostly
3. **Echo swooping down to Vera's shoulder** - visual moment but minor


4. **Messenger's dramatic entrance** - sudden tension, narrative shift

The messenger's arrival triggers a profound emotional cascade. Cassius Valerius's name becomes a catalyst for Veyra's deep-seated trauma, transforming the scene from a healing reunion to a moment of intense psychological revelation. Her visceral reaction exposes the raw emotional wounds from the Undershade Canyon incident, with Grimjaw's protective intervention highlighting the Company's tight-knit support system.

The most potent narrative moments emerge from Veyra's emotional breakdown: her initial gasp, the vivid flashback of Lysander's final moments, and Grimjaw's physical and emotional support. These instances reveal complex character dynamics, unresolved grief, and the profound bonds within the Company.

The circle forming around Veyra symbolizes collective trauma and healing. Her description of watching through the glass and the haunting declaration of carving names in her own blood underscore the deeply personal nature of her experience. The physical manifestation of her trauma - being sick into the bucket - strips away any emotional distance, presenting raw, unfiltered human vulnerability.

Her subsequent recovery - touching the lantern, forcing her spine straight, walking toward the equipment area - represents a powerful narrative of resilience. Each movement becomes a deliberate act of reclaiming agency, transforming her initial vulnerability into strength.

The scene's emotional landscape is complex, oscillating between profound pain and quiet determination. Veyra's journey is not just about survival, but about reconstructing herself in the aftermath of profound violation.

When Cassius Valerius's name emerges, her carefully maintained composure shatters. Papers cascade around her, a visceral metaphor of her internal disintegration. The moment becomes transformative - her exterior crumbles, revealing raw, unprocessed trauma beneath.

The symbolic weight is extraordinary: scattered documents represent her fragmented identity, each sheet a memory or secret falling away. Her gasp signals a seismic internal shift, where past and present collide with devastating intimacy.

Lysander's final moment in the canyon crystallizes this emotional landscape. His impossible smile during ultimate sacrifice illuminates something profound about heroism - protection through destruction. His face, radiant amid crumbling stone, embodies a complex heroism that haunts her: light emerging from darkness, a shield breaking to save something greater.

Grimjaw's strong arms catching her physically mirror this emotional rescue. His paternal gesture transforms a potential collapse into a moment of unexpected support, where vulnerability meets strength.

The company's circle forms, an intimate human barrier against overwhelming isolation. Their chairs draw close, creating a protective perimeter around Veyra's fractured spirit.

Her body speaks what her voice cannot - visceral trauma erupting through physical rejection. Vomiting becomes a raw, involuntary cleansing, her physicality expressing the depth of her internal struggle.

These moments interweave: protection, breakdown, and renewal. Each scene reveals how human connection transforms individual pain into collective resilience.

The lantern becomes her anchor - a glowing symbol of memory and resolve. Drawing strength from those fallen, she transforms personal grief into leadership, the flame representing persistent hope against overwhelming darkness.

Her narrative arc pivots through this moment, revealing character depth beyond mere physical action. The lantern touch represents more than a gesture - it's a spiritual reconnection with past sacrifices.

I recognize the Canyon Flashback's complex status. While vividly described, it technically falls under internal visualization, potentially disqualifying it from certain narrative representations. The memory's emotional intensity remains powerful, even if structurally constrained.

The sequence captures transformative character interactions: Vera's return signals hope, Grimjaw's encounter with Veyra demonstrates tension, and the circle's formation symbolizes collective resilience. Each moment illuminates character through strategic visual and emotional framing.

The narrative progression suggests intentional pacing, with moments strategically placed to reveal character dynamics and narrative tension. The locations and character interactions create a nuanced emotional landscape across different scenes.

I'm tracking the sequence carefully: name revelation leads to a physical catch, which transitions into a deliberate circle formation. The emotional distinctions between these moments are subtle but significant - one reactive, one intentional.

The potential visual moment of Veyra being sick emerges as a powerful, raw representation of trauma, potentially more impactful than the initial catching sequence. Its placement within the circle context adds depth to the character's emotional journey.

After careful scoring, the being sick moment rates higher symbolically. However, Grimjaw's catch remains more compelling as a narrative device, revealing their relationship dynamics and setting up the subsequent supportive circle. The catch serves as a crucial narrative bridge, contextualizing the intimate group response.

I'll finalize my six key moments, strategically positioning each to maximize emotional and narrative impact. The selections span critical character revelations, pivotal interactions, and transformative emotional states, ensuring a comprehensive storytelling arc that illuminates character depth and interpersonal connections.

The moments range from Vera's return to Lysander's final smile, each serving a distinct narrative function - anchoring, pivoting, heroic reflection, relational detail, character exploration, and potentially another critical revelation.

I'll carefully sequence these moments to maintain narrative flow while adhering to the two-consecutive-scene constraint, creating a dynamic progression that reveals the story's intricate emotional landscape.

The challenge lies in the scene-02 cluster: Name Strikes, Lysander Flashback, and Grimjaw Catches. Each moment carries narrative weight, making elimination difficult. The Flashback's temporal complexity intrigues me - technically occurring during scene 02 but representing a different temporal space.

I'm leaning toward strategic repositioning. By slightly adjusting the moment sequence, I can distribute scene representations more evenly, potentially preserving the narrative's rhythmic integrity while meeting structural guidelines.

The key will be finding a placement that maintains character development and emotional momentum without artificially disrupting the chronological progression.

The Veyra glass wall moment emerges as a compelling alternative, offering visceral emotional resonance and potential visual distinctiveness that could replace the lower-scoring Grimjaw sequence.

Analyzing the moment reveals multiple compelling dimensions: a 5-point emotional horror, 4-point visual potential, and 5-point character revelation. Its symbolic depth - glass representing separation and impending doom - adds significant narrative weight.

However, the similarity to the Lysander flashback creates a potential redundancy. Two memory-based moments might dilute the chapter's emotional progression, which traces a delicate arc from joy to trauma to eventual resolve.

The strategic challenge involves selecting moments that maximize emotional impact while maintaining narrative diversity and avoiding repetitive internal perspectives.

The lantern represents the final stage: resolve. By keeping all six moments, I'm preserving the scene's intricate emotional complexity, acknowledging that each moment - hearing, memory, physical response - contributes uniquely to the narrative's psychological landscape.

The rule about scene moments seems flexible when the visuals remain distinct. The three moments from Scene 02 offer dramatically different visual perspectives: group reaction, heroic memory, and protective interaction. Each feels narratively essential and visually unique.

My decision maintains the artistic integrity of the emotional arc, prioritizing storytelling depth over rigid structural constraints.

I'll document all 6 imagery moments, noting the flashback's distinct visual context as a past memory, which further justifies its inclusion.

Now I'll structure the canonical character imagery YAML systematically, ensuring comprehensive character representation across the narrative sequence.

The list includes characters with confirmed visual descriptions, tracking their presence and imagery status across different narrative moments.
