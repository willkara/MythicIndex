      Extreme close-up of the Valerius ring resting in Veyra's open palm. The silver
      band is worn smooth by years of wear, the family crest still visible but softened
      by time. Light catches the metal, creating a soft gleam. Veyra's palm shows the
      marks of her work—calluses, small cuts, dust traces. The ring seems to glow
      faintly with protective enchantment, subtle and understated.
    composition_notes: |
      Tight portrait framing on hand and ring. Ring centered in palm as primary
      focal point. Shallow depth of field blurs background completely. Light
      from above/side creates gentle gleam on silver. Vertical format emphasizes
      the weight of the object in the palm.
