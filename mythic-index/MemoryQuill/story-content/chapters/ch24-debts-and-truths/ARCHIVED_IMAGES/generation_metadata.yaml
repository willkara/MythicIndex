    and weather resistance

    - **Body Language**: Alert, observant, tends to scan environments constantly

    - **Physical Condition**: Cleared for light duty after 2.5 weeks of druidic healing
    - still pale and thinner than normal, requires walking staff for longer distances,
    but maintaining sharp intelligence and analytical abilities


    Vera Moonwhisper is a half-elf with a lean, rangy build suited to a life in the
    wilderness. Her dark brown hair is kept in a practical braid threaded with feathers
    and bone beads. Her hazel eyes shift to amber when she uses her druidic abilities.
    She wears practical, earth-toned leather and canvas clothing designed for silent
    movement. She is often accompanied by her raven, Echo.. Symbolic emphasis: Growth
    through survival, beast and human in harmony, wisdom from wilderness.'
