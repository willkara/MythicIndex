The Last Light Company limped through Waterdeep's empty streets like the survivors of a war that no one else had fought yet. Limestone dust clung to every surface—hair, clothes, the creases around their eyes where sweat had carved tracks through the grime. Marcus's appearance showed signs of the chaotic scene, his fine clothes dusty but otherwise intact from coordinating the crowd control. Grimjaw walked with stone chips still embedded in his beard, muttering calculations about load distributions under his breath. Aldwin supported Kelen, whose persistent cough spoke of too much smoke inhaled in the depths of the collapsed library.

The few souls still wandering the streets at this late hour stopped and stared. A drunk nobleman in purple silk stumbled backwards at the sight of them, wine sloshing from his goblet. "Gods above, were you caught in a flour mill explosion?"

"Something like that," Thorne replied tiredly, his armor showing only light dust from the long day of managing the rescue site.

Near the Dock Ward, a group of late-night revelers outside a tavern fell silent as the Company passed. One pointed with obvious concern. "Should we... should we call a healer?"

"We have one," Veyra said, nodding toward Aldwin. Her voice was hoarse from shouting orders through dust and debris. She absently touched her chest where Cassius Valerius had gripped her shirt with desperate strength, his recognition cutting through the chaos of falling stone and rising panic.

A City Watch patrol recognized them near the warehouse district. "Last Light Company?" the sergeant asked, his expression shifting from casual alertness to something approaching awe. "What in the nine hells happened to you?"

"Library collapse," Grimjaw grunted. "We got them out."

The patrol exchanged glances. "All of them?"

"All the living ones," Veyra confirmed, and something in her tone discouraged further questions. The sergeant offered an escort, but she waved them off. They were almost home.

The warehouse complex had never looked more welcoming. Warm light spilled from the windows of all three buildings, and as they approached the main entrance, the door swung open. Mistress Elba stood silhouetted in the doorway, her dwarven frame filling the space despite her relatively small stature, her usual stern expression replaced by something softer—relief mixed with grandmother's concern.

"About time, children," she said gruffly, but her amber eyes catalogued their injuries with the practiced efficiency of a grandmother who'd tended three children and seven grandchildren through countless scrapes. "Hot water's ready. Bandages laid out. Food keeping warm—just like when my little ones used to come home from their adventures."

They stumbled inside like drunks, the familiar cavernous space feeling surreal after the chaos of the rescue. Fayne collapsed into a chair near the Briefing Circle and immediately began sketching, trying to capture details before exhaustion claimed them. Finn sat heavily on a crate, staring at his hands as if surprised to find them still attached. The newer recruits—Darric, Venn, Kelen—looked shell-shocked, the reality of their chosen profession settling into their bones along with the dust.

"How many?" Marcus asked, settling into his chair at the large map table. Despite managing the press and crowd for hours, his diplomat's composure remained intact, though weariness showed around the edges.

"Four survivors," Aldwin reported quietly, setting down his medical kit. "Three we couldn't reach in time—they were already gone when we found them." He didn't elaborate on the state they'd found the bodies, and no one asked.

"Four people who go home to their families," Veyra said, sinking into her own chair. "Four people who don't become names on a memorial stone." She touched her chest again, feeling the phantom grip of desperate hands. One of those four had known her face, had whispered a dead man's name in the dark.

Mistress Elba moved between them, pressing warm cloths into their hands, checking wounds that hadn't been properly tended in the urgency of the rescue. "The city doesn't know yet, child," she said quietly, crossing her arms thoughtfully. "No word's gotten out about what happened. But it will."

"Tomorrow," Thorne agreed, already dreading the attention that would follow. They weren't just a Watch patrol anymore. Tonight had changed that.

Grimjaw pulled a chunk of carved stone from his pocket—a piece of the library's facade that had broken off in his hands as he'd repositioned a crucial support beam. He set it on the table with careful reverence. "Good architecture," he said simply. "Built to last. Took something mighty to bring her down."

"And something mightier to hold her up long enough," Fayne added, their sketch showing the dwarf braced against a tilted column, muscles straining as people fled beneath the improvised support.

They sat in the warm light, too tired to celebrate, too aware of what they'd lost to feel victorious. But four families would wake tomorrow to loved ones who might not have come home. For now, that was enough.

Veyra's fingers found the collar of her shirt again, pressing against the place where a dying man's brother had recognized something in her face. Tomorrow would bring questions she wasn't ready to answer. Tonight, she was simply grateful to be sitting in a chair instead of buried under stone.

One by one, they drifted toward rest—some to actual beds on the mezzanine level, others to wherever exhaustion claimed them in the vast main warehouse. The weight of victory, Veyra reflected, was heavier than anyone expected.

*Two days after the library rescue...*

The warehouse complex buzzed with an energy it hadn't known since the frantic preparations before Westwall, though the Company members themselves moved with the careful deliberation of people still nursing injuries. Copies of the _Waterdeep Daily Chronicle_ were scattered across every table in the main warehouse, their bold headlines catching the morning light streaming through the tall windows. **"MIRACULOUS RESCUE AT GREAT LIBRARY"** dominated the front page, accompanied by an artist's dramatic rendering of Grimjaw directing a massive stone slab into place.

From Building B, the rhythmic hammering of Grimjaw's forge provided a steady backdrop to the morning's activities, while the sound of Mistress Elba bustling about The Mess drifted through the covered walkways connecting the buildings.

Kelen still coughed occasionally, a lingering reminder of the smoke they'd breathed. Finn flexed his bandaged hands as he read, the cuts from handling broken stone not yet fully healed. Even Veyra moved with slight stiffness, her shoulder protesting where debris had struck her during the rescue.

Mistress Elba moved between the tables with unusual cheer, her dwarven stature somehow making her presence even more bustling as she served breakfast alongside congratulations. "Twenty-three well-wishers at the door this morning," she announced proudly, straightening her apron with satisfaction. "Including three marriage proposals for Commander Thornwake and one rather odd one for Master Ironbeard. Reminds me of when my Dain's bakery got mentioned in the guild newsletter—couldn't keep the admirers away!"

Grimjaw grunted from his corner table near the entrance to the workshop building, where he was meticulously cleaning his gear. "Hmph. Must be someone who appreciates a dwarf who knows his structural mechanics."

"It was a masterful bit of work, Grimjaw," Fayne said, holding up a sketch she'd been working on. "The way you used that fallen pillar as a counter-lever? The Masons' Guild will be studying that for years."

"Aye," the dwarf rumbled, a rare hint of a smile touching his lips. "Sometimes the best tool is the one the disaster gives you."

Marcus leaned back in his chair, a copy of the _Chronicle_ spread before him. "Listen to this description: 'Commander Thornwake, her face marked by the sacred scars of her canyon ordeal, led her team through dangers that would turn seasoned adventurers to ash.'" He looked up with amusement. "Sacred scars, Veyra? I don't recall you mentioning the religious significance."

"Journalists," Veyra replied, shaking her head but not entirely displeased. "What else are they saying?"

Thorne folded his paper and set it aside. "Three different tavern ballads are already being composed. The City Watch has received seven formal requests for our services. And apparently, Lady Silverhand wants to invite us to a dinner party."

"Given the nature of noble dinner parties," Marcus observed dryly, "there's often very little difference between being guests and being entertainment."

Just then, Finn hurried in from the main entrance, looking flustered. "Commander, there's a reporter here. A Tamsin, from the _Waterdeep Wasp_. She's very... insistent."

Marcus's smile tightened into something between disapproval and admiration. "The _Wasp_ is less a newspaper and more a collection of creative rumors. Allow me." He rose smoothly, but there was a resigned set to his shoulders. "She won't leave without something to print. I'll handle this—give her just enough to satisfy her while keeping the real story intact. No one else speaks to her. Understood?"

A few minutes later, Marcus returned, escorting a woman with aggressively sharp spectacles and a quill that seemed to twitch with predatory hunger. His expression carried the look of a man who had just negotiated with a particularly persistent merchant.

"Tamsin, a pleasure," Marcus said, his voice dripping with professional charm. "As you can see, the Company is in the midst of post-operational analysis. We have very little time, but I understand your readers are quite interested in our recent success."

"Of course, Master Heartbridge," Tamsin said, her eyes scanning the cavernous space. "My readers are just so captivated! Commander Thornwake, is it true you spoke to the ghost of the library's founder to find the survivors?"

Veyra blinked. "No."

"And Master Ironbeard," Tamsin continued, undeterred, "did you truly wrestle a stone golem that had animated from the rubble?"

"It was a load-bearing column," Grimjaw growled. "And I didn't wrestle it, I moved it."

Marcus stepped smoothly between the reporter and the team. "Tamsin, your enthusiasm is admirable. The Last Light Company is a team of professionals who combine established engineering principles, advanced medical knowledge, and specialized arcane talents to achieve our goals. The 'miracle' was one of hard work and expertise. Now, if you'll excuse us, we have a city to protect."

He gently but firmly guided the sputtering reporter back towards the door. When he returned, the team was silent for a moment.

"This is new," Thorne stated, his expression serious. "We're not just a Watch patrol anymore. We're a public story. And stories can be twisted."

"Don't like it," Darric grumbled into her mug. "Folk staring. Asking questions. It ain't right."

"But it has its uses," Venn countered, ever the optimist. "Think of the support we could get. The city is on our side. That's a powerful ally."

"Venn's right," Halden added. "Out there, people are scared. If they see us as heroes, they'll trust us when every second counts. That saves lives." He gestured to the pile of supply requests on his desk. "Though I'll be working overtime to meet all these new demands for equipment."

"They printed nonsense about golems when the real story was the engineering," Grimjaw muttered. "They focus on the flash, not the foundation." He held up a letter with the seal of the Masons' Guild. "At least some folk want to discuss the actual technique."

From her corner, Darric shifted uncomfortably. "Had a woman stop me yesterday, wanted to touch my cloak for luck. Felt wrong, somehow. I was just doing my job."

"I've been sketching portraits of 'the heroic rescue team' all morning," Fayne said with a wry smile. "Apparently half the noble houses want commemorative pieces. The coin's good, but..." They gestured at their drawing of Grimjaw. "They want him looking more 'heroically dwarven' and less 'covered in stone dust and swearing about load calculations.'"

"Which is precisely why we must control the narrative," Marcus said, retaking his seat. "The _Wasp_ prints fantasy. The _Chronicle_ prints competence. We will feed the _Chronicle_ and starve the _Wasp_. Our reputation is now a strategic asset, and we will manage it as such."

"It also means we have influence," Veyra said, picking up Marcus's point. "But to use it, we need to be ready for what comes next. We need to be at full strength." Her gaze swept the room, noting the missing members of their core team. "Any word from Vera and Rill?"

Aldwin looked up from his tea. "They returned to the grove this morning. Rill felt the city's energy was too much for Vera's final stages of recovery. A few more days of quiet, and she'll be fully back."

"Good," Veyra nodded. "Let her rest. We'll need her." She then turned her attention back to Aldwin. "Speaking of recovery, you said Master Cassius is doing well?"

Aldwin's expression grew more serious. "He is. And he's asking questions. About the rescue. And about you, Veyra."

The room fell thoughtfully quiet. The victory was sweet, but it had unearthed a past Veyra had yet to fully confront.

"He recognized you, didn't he?" Thorne asked softly. "In the library."

Veyra gave a slight nod. "I have to see him. But I don't know... I don't know how much to tell him."

"The truth is a heavy stone, Veyra," Grimjaw said gruffly. "Sometimes you don't have to lift it all at once."

"Grimjaw's right," Marcus added. "But while you're dealing with that, remember the other clock is ticking. The library rescue put us in the spotlight. The Silent Hand will have noticed. We should assume they're accelerating their plans."

The reminder cast a shadow over the morning's celebrations.

"Then I'd better not wait," Veyra said, her decision made. "Aldwin, will you come with me?"

"Of course, Commander."

*Three days after the rescue...*

The Temple of Tyr rose like a beacon of order, its white stone walls reflecting the late morning sun. Veyra walked the corridors with a knot in her stomach that had nothing to do with her healing ribs and everything to do with the conversation ahead. Aldwin was a steady, calming presence at her side, his healer's instincts picking up on her tension.

"You don't have to tell him everything today," he said quietly as they approached the recovery chambers. "Sometimes healing happens in stages."

Veyra nodded, but her fingers still found the collar of her shirt, pressing against the spot where desperate hands had gripped her in the dark.

They found Cassius in a private chamber overlooking a garden. He was sitting up in bed, looking far stronger than Veyra expected—the pallor was gone from his cheeks, and his eyes held the clear focus of someone who had processed trauma and emerged intact. When he saw her, his expression shifted from polite courtesy to something deeper.

"Commander Thornwake." His voice carried weight she hadn't expected. "I've been hoping you'd visit. Please, sit." He gestured to chairs Aldwin had already arranged. "Both of you. Master Gentleheart, your healing touch saved my life as surely as Commander Thornwake's leadership."

But his eyes never left Veyra's face, and she could see recognition there—not just of her as his rescuer, but something more personal, more complicated.

Veyra sat carefully, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. Cassius leaned forward slightly, his expression thoughtful.

"I remember your voice," he said quietly. "In the dark, under the stone. You called my name—not just 'survivor' or 'hold on,' but my actual name. Cassius Valerius." His eyes searched her face. "How did you know who I was when you couldn't even see me?"

The question hung in the air. Aldwin remained silent, recognizing this was between them.

"I remember other things too," Cassius continued when she didn't immediately answer. "The sound of stone being moved with precision, not just brute force. Orders given by someone who understood structural collapse. And underneath it all, a voice that seemed... familiar. Like an echo of something I'd heard described before."

Veyra's breath caught. She could feel Aldwin's concerned gaze on her, but her focus remained on Cassius.

"You seem to carry a great weight for someone so recently hailed as a hero," Cassius observed gently. "Is there something you need to tell me?"

She swallowed, her throat tight. "The official reports... about the Gilded Compass..." she began, her voice barely a whisper. "They were true. The mission in Undershade Canyon... it went south."

Cassius's expression softened with sympathy, though not yet with understanding. "Every mission carries risk. My brother knew that better than anyone. You mustn't carry the burden of that failure alone."

He paused, a thought slowly connecting in his mind. The way she looked at him in the library. Her presence here now. "The Gilded Compass... that was Lysander's company." His eyes widened slightly as the final piece clicked into place. "Gods... you were with him. You're Veyra. The survivor."

Veyra could only nod, the name hanging in the air between them.

Cassius fell silent, the cheerful gratitude replaced by a profound, somber respect. He didn't press for details, seeing the raw pain she held just below the surface. When he spoke again, his voice was thick with emotion.

"He wrote about you constantly in his letters," he said softly. "The steadfast ranger who could find a path through anything. The woman who never left anyone behind, no matter how dark the trail became." He paused, his eyes distant with memory. "In his last letter, he said you were the finest soldier he'd ever served with. That you had a gift for seeing the way forward when everyone else saw only walls."

Veyra's hands trembled slightly. "He trusted me," she whispered. "And I—"

"You survived," Cassius interrupted gently but firmly. "And that means part of him survived too. The part that saw something in you worth believing in."

He reached for something on the bedside table—a simple silver ring bearing the Valerius family crest, its surface worn smooth by years of wear. "He would want you to have this. It was his shield, in a way."

"Cassius, I can't—" Veyra began, but he gently pressed the ring into her palm.

"It won't stop a dragon's breath," he continued, his voice growing stronger, more certain. "But it has a way of turning a fatal blow into a survivable one. A flicker of protective force when you need it most. He said it was like having an ancestor's hand on his shoulder during the darkest moments." His eyes met hers. "He would have wanted that protection to go to someone who saves people the way you saved me. The way you tried to save him."

Veyra stared at the ring, its silver band catching the morning light. The weight of it in her palm felt enormous—not just the physical weight, but the weight of trust, of legacy, of a friendship that had ended in failure and was now being offered a chance at redemption.

"I couldn't save him," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

"But you didn't abandon him either," Cassius replied, and something in his tone made her look up. "That's what he wrote about most—not your tactical skills or your ranger training, but the fact that you never gave up on anyone. Even at the end." His voice grew soft. "He knew what kind of person you were, Veyra. That's why he trusted you with his life. And that's why I'm trusting you with his legacy."

She closed her fingers around the ring, feeling its warmth spread through her palm. "Think of it not as a debt," Cassius added, his voice carrying the same sad warmth that had made his brother so easy to follow. "But as a partnership that transcends death. His past, your future."

Walking back through Waterdeep's busy streets, Veyra felt the weight of the ring on a chain around her neck. It wasn't the release she'd half-expected, but a tangible inheritance. A promise she could feel.

*Five days after the library rescue...*

The warehouse complex's main building was interrupted by two welcome arrivals that brought a palpable shift in energy. Vera Moonwhisper entered with a measured stride that spoke of renewed confidence, her posture straighter than it had been since the transformation trauma. There was something different about her—a stillness that seemed to extend beyond her own body, as if she carried a piece of the grove's ancient peace with her. Rill Vossari walked beside her, but even the experienced druid seemed slightly awed by the change in her former patient.

Echo cawed from Vera's shoulder, the raven's black feathers gleaming with health, but his eyes held an intelligence that seemed sharper than before, more connected to his companion.

"Vera!" Finn called out, his face lighting up with relief. "You look... you look like yourself again. But more, somehow?"

Vera's lips curved into a rare, genuine smile. "The Archdruids have a saying: 'The tree that survives the storm grows stronger roots.' I think I understand what they meant now."

While Veyra and Thorne approached from the Briefing Circle, Rill was already in conversation with Aldwin and Mistress Elba over in The Mess area, handing them a small leather pouch of herbs.

"A calming tea blend," Rill explained with a warm smile, her webbed fingers gentle as she showed them the dried leaves. "Chamomile, valerian root, and a touch of moonwell sage. She's remarkably strong, but the city's energy can be overwhelming after weeks in the grove's deep peace." She gave Vera a meaningful look. "The transition back to urban life should be gradual. No jumping into dangerous situations for at least a few days, yes?"

"I've heard that before," Vera said dryly, but there was fondness in her tone.

"Because you have a tendency to ignore good advice when people need rescuing," Rill replied with mock sternness.

Mistress Elba nodded approvingly. "Sensible girl, this one. I like her already." She examined the herbs with professional interest. "This moonwell sage—I've heard of it but never worked with it. What does it do?"

"It helps bridge the gap between natural magic and daily life," Rill explained. "Vera's connection to the wild has deepened significantly. Without something to ease the transition, the city's artificial energies could cause... discomfort."

"Vera," Veyra said, approaching with genuine warmth in her voice. "It's good to see you back on your feet."

"It's good to be back," Vera replied, clasping Veyra's forearm in the gesture warriors used with trusted comrades. "Though I'll admit, after weeks of forest quiet, all this stone and metal feels..." she paused, searching for the word, "loud. But manageable."

Marcus rose from his chair, studying her with professional interest. "You move differently. More centered. The grove's healing was thorough."

"The druids don't just heal the body," Vera explained, unconsciously straightening. "They help you find balance between all aspects of yourself. The human mind, the beast awareness, the connection to the natural world. I'm still me, but I understand myself better now."

Grimjaw looked her up and down with a critical eye from where he stood near the entrance to Building B. "They feed you properly in that grove? You look less like a starved wolf."

"The food was... green," Vera said with a faint smile. "But nourishing. The Archdruid said the healing had to be from the inside out."

Thorne stepped forward, his expression carrying both professional assessment and personal concern. "The transformation trauma—is it fully resolved?"

Vera was quiet for a moment, considering her answer carefully. "Not resolved. Integrated. The rage that drove me to change, the wildness that nearly consumed me—it's still there. But now I understand it as part of me, not something foreign trying to take over." She looked down at her hands, flexing her fingers. "The druids taught me that the beast isn't the enemy of the human mind. They're meant to work together."

"What was it like?" Fayne asked, their artist's curiosity piqued. "The grove, I mean. The actual place?"

"Quiet," Vera answered, her eyes distant for a moment. "And alive in a way this city isn't. Everything is connected—the trees, the stones, the water, even the air between them. You can feel the web of life, the way energy flows from one living thing to another." She gestured to the warehouse around them. "Here, everything feels... compartmentalized. Separated. But it helped me re-center, find my own roots in that larger pattern."

Darric shifted in her chair, looking curious despite her usual reticence. "Sounds peaceful. Must've been hard to leave."

"It was," Vera admitted. "But the grove isn't a place to hide from the world. It's a place to understand your role in it. And my role..." She looked around at the assembled Company members, "is here. With all of you. My pack."

Echo cawed softly, and several team members smiled at the obvious contentment in the sound.

Aldwin nodded thoughtfully, his healer's instincts recognizing the deeper changes in her. "The integration work the druids do goes beyond what conventional healing can achieve. How do you feel the change has affected your abilities?"

"My connection to Echo is stronger," Vera said, touching the raven's feathers. "We share more than just companionship now—there's an understanding that goes beyond words or gestures. And my awareness of the natural world has expanded. I can sense the life force of creatures at a much greater distance, feel the health of growing things, even in this stone city."

Rill nodded approvingly. "The transformation trauma, when properly integrated, often grants new abilities rather than just scars. Vera has learned to channel what nearly destroyed her into something that makes her more effective, not less."

"I'm ready for what's next," Vera said, looking directly at Veyra. "And what's next is time-sensitive."

"Good," Grimjaw said from near the workshop building entrance. "Because what's next is already here."

"The Silent Hand," Vera said, her voice hardening as she joined the main group at the Briefing Circle. She spread out a collection of documents—the ledger from Stonebridge, sketched maps, and notes in her precise handwriting. "Rill and I have been analyzing everything we know, cross-referencing the trafficking patterns with seasonal waterways and trade routes."

She pointed to specific entries in the ledger. "Look at these supply requests. The quantities have doubled in the past month, but more importantly, they're stockpiling materials that suggest they're preparing to move a large group of people. Medical supplies, concentrated rations, cold weather gear." Her finger traced a route on one of her sketched maps. "And they're using waterways that are only navigable during spring flooding—routes that bypass the main trade inspections."

"How large a group?" Veyra asked, leaning forward.

"Based on these supply calculations?" Vera's expression grew grim. "At least fifty people, possibly more. And they're planning to move them within the next four weeks, before the spring floods recede and those routes become impassable again."

Echo cawed softly, and Vera glanced at him. "The ravens have been watching the areas around Stonebridge. There's increased activity at several sites that weren't in our original intelligence." She looked up at the team. "My brother is in one of those facilities, and if they're consolidating their operations for a major shipment..."

Her voice didn't waver, but her knuckles were white where they gripped the table edge.

Marcus stepped forward, laying a leather folder on the table. "And our preparations have hit a snag. This is Korrath 'Wallbreaker' Threnx. The engineer who designed the facility's water systems. He's our key to understanding its defenses."

He opened the folder. "The problem is his partner, Cidrella Vexweld, our recent consultant. She trusts him completely and has no idea his past work is being used by slavers. If we approach him directly, we risk exposing her or driving him underground. He's a ghost—no official residence, moves between guild halls. Cid is our only connection."

The team was quiet, the complexity of the situation settling over them. They had the what, the where, and the why, but the how was a tangled knot of personal relationships and professional ethics.

Later that day, Veyra, Thorne, and Vera sat around a small table in The Mess, picking at a simple lunch Mistress Elba had prepared for them. The strategic maps were put away, but copies of the morning newspapers lay scattered nearby—a constant reminder that their every move was now watched by the city. Veyra still moved carefully, her shoulder protesting when she reached for her water cup, while Thorne absently flexed his sword hand where cuts from broken stone were still healing.

"We could just grab him," Vera said, her voice low and intense. "Find him when he's alone, away from the girl. A quiet interrogation. He tells us what we need to know, and he's never seen again. It's clean."

Thorne set his fork down, his expression unreadable. "Clean? Vera, this is Waterdeep, not a bandit camp. A master engineer, a guild member, vanishes? That brings a level of scrutiny from the Lords and the Watch that we can't afford. We're trying to build trust, not operate like a thieves' guild."

"My brother doesn't have time for trust!" Vera shot back, her knuckles white. She pulled out one of her sketched maps, pointing to marked locations. "Look at these patterns—every two weeks, supply caravans move between these three facilities. The timing coincides with high water levels in the flooding season. They're using natural cover and seasonal access to avoid detection." Her finger traced routes between the sites. "Based on the supply quantities and movement patterns, they're consolidating captives before shipping them out. If we wait for official authorization, the spring window closes and they scatter to different routes we can't track."

Her voice grew more intense. "Those children don't have time for bureaucracy. While we navigate politics and attend dinner parties with nobles, the Hand fills their cages and moves them beyond our reach."

"And what happens when we act on that intelligence and it goes wrong?" Thorne countered, his voice calm but firm. He gestured toward the windows where another small crowd had gathered to stare at their headquarters. "Look around us, Vera. We're not an anonymous mercenary company anymore. Every move we make is scrutinized, every decision analyzed in newspapers and taverns across the city." His expression grew serious. "With no official sanction, we're on our own if things go wrong. We'd be branded criminals, vigilantes who overstepped their authority. Everything we've built here—the support, the reputation, the trust that lets us save people like Cassius—it would all turn to ash overnight."

He leaned forward, his voice dropping. "And then how many more children suffer because the Last Light Company became a cautionary tale instead of a force for good?"

Veyra listened, letting them voice the two sides of the conflict that warred within her own mind. Vera's fierce urgency, Thorne's strategic caution. Both were right.

Finally, she spoke, her voice carrying the weight of command that had been forged in countless difficult decisions. "Vera, your path is a direct line, and I admire its clarity. In the wilderness, that directness saves lives. But Thorne is right—we are in a different jungle now. The beasts here wear signet rings and carry scrolls instead of swords, and they can destroy us with whispered rumors as easily as any blade."

She touched the ring beneath her shirt, drawing strength from Lysander's legacy. "We have a provisional charter, earned through the library rescue. We are a civic asset with the city's trust. It's time we leveraged that properly."

She pushed her plate away, her decision crystallizing. "We'll do this by the book. Their book. We will brief Lady Blackwater and Captain Grimsby within the day. We will present Vera's intelligence analysis, explain the time constraints of the spring flooding, and detail the situation with Korrath and Cid." Her voice grew stronger. "We'll request formal authorization, backup resources, and official sanction for a coordinated operation against the Silent Hand facilities."

She looked directly at Vera. "Your tracking intelligence gives us the tactical advantage. The city's trust gives us the political backing. Together, that's more powerful than any shadow operation could be."

Thorne nodded, a look of relief on his face. Vera said nothing, but her jaw was tight with a frustration Veyra understood all too well.

"Set up the meeting," Veyra commanded, her voice leaving no room for argument. "Tomorrow morning, if possible."

As they rose from the table, Veyra placed a hand on Vera's shoulder. "Patience, Vera," she said softly. "We'll get them. But we'll do it in a way that ensures we can keep getting them, again and again."
