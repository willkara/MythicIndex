This is a detailed art direction request for Chapter 19: "An Olive Branch." Let me analyze what I've received and produce a comprehensive imagery.yaml output.

**Chapter Summary:**
- The Last Light Company attends a formal event at the Azure Pavilion
- Veyra struggles with exposing her scars in formal attire
- Marcus gets publicly humiliated by Matriarch Stoneheart
- Veyra transforms a rude encounter about her scars into a defining moment
- Captain Grimsby delivers a toast that both recognizes and constrains the Company
- The chapter ends with fragile hope

**Visual Thesis:** "From the vulnerability of unfamiliar clothes to the armored dignity of earned recognition, strangers become figures of consequence."

**Mood Distribution Needs:**
Looking at the 6 candidate moments:
1. Veyra reading invitation, touching scars - intimate/somber (private vulnerability)
2. Company arriving at Azure Pavilion - celebratory with tension
3. Marcus humiliated by Matriarch Stoneheart - intimate (exposed inadequacy)
4. Veyra's "every scar tells a story" moment - could be intimate or ceremonial
5. Grimsby's toast - celebratory/ceremonial
6. Veyra's smile looking at Waterdeep - intimate/pastoral (fragile hope)

I need variety - let me think about mood selection:

**Moment 1 (Veyra + invitation):** 
- Setting: Warehouse interior, morning, dusty light
- Emotion: Private vulnerability, anxiety
- Best fit: **INTIMATE** - single warm source (lamplight), quiet poetry, tender composition
- This is a private moment of fear before steeling herself

**Moment 2 (Company arrival at Azure Pavilion):**
- Setting: Marble colonnade, evening, crystal lanterns
- Emotion: Determined awkwardness, stepping into unfamiliar territory


- Best fit: **CELEBRATORY** - multiple warm sources (crystal lanterns), rich colors against marble
- This should feel slightly overwhelming, almost too much light

**Moment 3 (Marcus humiliated):**
- Setting: Party crowd, evening
- Emotion: Exposed inadequacy, rare vulnerability
- Best fit: **INTIMATE** - focusing on the crack in his mask
- Soft light revealing what he usually hides

**Moment 4 (Veyra's "every scar tells a story"):**
- Setting: Party, evening, crystal light
- Emotion: Quiet dominance, transformation
- Best fit: **CELEBRATORY** with an intimate undertone, highlighting her personal power and narrative control
- Crystal lanterns illuminating her scars as a statement of strength

**Moment 5 (Grimsby's toast):**
- Dramatic platform scene with layered emotional complexity
- Ceremonial moment blending celebration and subtle threat
- Lighting suggests triumph with an edge of potential danger
- Olive branch imagery implies both peace and potential conflict

**Moment 6 (Veyra's smile at Waterdeep):**
- Harbor setting with expansive, breathing atmosphere
- Soft diffused light capturing fragile optimism
- Emotional landscape of possibility and quiet anticipation
- City lights suggesting potential and transformation

Emotional scene progression needs strategic recalibration:
1. **INTIMATE** - Personal vulnerability
2. **SOMBER** - Weighted emotional moment
3. **CELEBRATORY** - Spectacle and triumph
4. **PASTORAL** - Expansive hope
5. **CEREMONIAL** - Complex power dynamics

Seeking emotional texture and narrative arc through varied tonal shifts. His toast carries an undercurrent of warning, blending celebration with subtle tension. The mood remains celebratory but with nuanced complexity - warm tones offset by hints of constraint and potential conflict. By carefully balancing recognition and subtle threat, Grimsby's moment creates a layered emotional landscape that suggests deeper interpersonal dynamics beneath the surface festivities.

The chapter's mood progression reveals a strategic emotional arc: starting intimate, building through celebratory interactions, and ultimately resolving with a sense of pastoral hope. This emotional trajectory allows character moments of vulnerability and connection to emerge against the backdrop of a social gathering, creating narrative depth through carefully modulated atmospheric shifts.

Character visual details will anchor this emotional complexity. Veyra's formal attire - a dark gown replacing her typical armor - signals a significant social transition, while her distinctive physical markers like the burn scar and turquoise-beaded braid maintain her core identity. Thorne's dress uniform similarly communicates a moment of formality that diverges from his typical presentation, suggesting the scene's unique emotional weight.

Each character's scene variation reveals nuanced social positioning. Marcus appears sophisticated with his high-collared doublet and rapier, Aldwin unexpectedly dapper in plum, while Grimjaw's borrowed attire hints at potential narrative tension. Their costume shifts suggest a pivotal social gathering where traditional roles are momentarily suspended.

Vera's marginal positioning in a muted green cloak contrasts with the group's more elaborate presentations. Her vine-marked cheek and lean frame imply a character with complex backstory and potential external pressures. Quartermaster Fayne's scholarly outfit further emphasizes a group whose professional identities are in subtle flux.

The characters' wardrobe choices communicate unspoken dynamics - status, adaptation, and underlying personal narratives emerging through carefully selected attire.
