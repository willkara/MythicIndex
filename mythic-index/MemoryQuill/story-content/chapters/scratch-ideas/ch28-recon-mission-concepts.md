# Chapter 28 Reconnaissance Mission Concepts

This document outlines potential mission plans for the reconnaissance of the Silent Hand facility, combining the skills of the Last Light Company with the specialized talents of Lyra "Mockingbird" Nightingale.

## Overall Strategy: "Capture, Interrogate, and Impersonate"

A multi-phase approach that leverages both the Company's tactical skills and Lyra's unique intelligence-gathering capabilities.

### Phase 1: Target Selection
- **Objective**: Identify a mid-level operative (guard sergeant, technician) who has knowledge and access but whose absence won't trigger an immediate full-scale alarm.
- **Execution**: The Last Light Company leads this phase.
  - **Vera & Rill** conduct initial surveillance. Vera tracks patrols and routines; Rill uses water-sense to estimate population counts and monitor the magical suppression system.
  - The team analyzes the data to select the optimal target for abduction.

### Phase 2: Abduction & Interrogation
- **Objective**: Secure the target and extract actionable intelligence.
- **Execution**:
  - **The Abduction**: Thorne and the Company's tactical members plan and execute a clean, non-lethal capture based on the surveillance intel.
  - **The Interrogation**: This is Lyra's primary role, with Marcus acting as a foil.
    - **Marcus** attempts a soft approach (rapport-building, appeals to conscience).
    - **Lyra** employs advanced psychological techniques when the soft approach is insufficient:
      - **Vocal Manipulation**: Uses mimicry to impersonate the captive's superiors or loved ones, creating confusion and distress.
      - **The Lullaby**: As a final tool, she can begin humming her infamous "lullaby." Given its dark reputation in the underworld, the sound itself acts as a powerful psychological weapon, confirming the identity of the interrogator and the gravity of the situation.
    - **Intelligence Goals**: Guard schedules, captive locations, command structure, communication protocols, and details on the suppression system controls.

### Phase 3: Infiltration & Manipulation
- **Objective**: Use the extracted intelligence and Lyra's mimicry to conduct close-target reconnaissance.
- **Execution**: Lyra takes the lead, with the Company acting in support.
  - **Impersonation**: Lyra assumes the voice and identity of the captured operative.
  - **Actions**:
    1.  **Create Diversions**: Using the enemy's communication system, she can report a believable technical emergency (with input from Grimjaw on plausibility) to draw guards away from sensitive areas.
    2.  **Sow Chaos**: Issue conflicting orders to paralyze the command structure and create windows of opportunity.
    3.  **Provide Cover**: While the Company's stealth team (Veyra/Vera) moves in to get a direct visual, Lyra can maintain the illusion that all is well, reporting "all clear" from the captured guard's post.

### Core Narrative Tension
- The primary conflict will be the Company's reliance on Lyra's deeply unsettling and morally ambiguous methods to achieve their noble goal.
- A key decision point will arise if Lyra recommends killing the captive after the interrogation to "tie up loose ends," forcing Veyra to make a difficult command decision.
