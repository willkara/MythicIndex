# Chapter Scratch Ideas

This is a space for brainstorming and developing raw ideas for chapters before they are ready to become formal drafts.

- **Workflow:**
  1. Add ideas here as `.md` files.
  2. Develop concepts, outlines, or scene snippets.
  3. When an idea is ready, create a formal draft in the `../drafts` directory.
  4. Delete scratch files for ideas that are discarded.
