# Lyra Ambush Scene Ideas (for Chapter 28)

## Scene Idea 1: Campfire Threat

**[SCENE START]**

The small campfire crackled, a lonely point of warmth in the cool night of the wooded hills. The main camp was quiet, most of the team resting after the tense hours of surveillance. Vera and Aldwin sat near the flames, the former sharpening a knife with methodical precision, the latter quietly reviewing his medical notes by the flickering light. Echo perched on a low branch nearby, the raven's dark eyes alert in the firelight. Lyra was a few feet away, a still silhouette perched on a fallen log, seemingly lost in thought as she stared into the darkness beyond the fire's glow.

The quiet was comfortable, a brief respite. Aldwin had just started to ask Vera a question about a particular type of tracking poultice when Echo suddenly shifted, his head cocking to one side. A low, almost inaudible caw escaped his beak.

Vera's hand stilled over her whetstone, her ranger instincts picking up on her companion's warning. Her eyes flicked briefly to Echo, then to the darkness beyond the fire. Something was wrong.

Lyra noticed Vera's subtle tension immediately. Without turning, her voice cut through the night, soft but absolute.

"Aldwin, continue your question. Vera, answer him. Do not stop talking, and do not look away from the fire."

The words were spoken with such disarming calm that it took a moment for their chilling implication to land. Aldwin's voice faltered. Vera's hand froze over her whetstone.

"Now," Lyra insisted, her tone still conversational, though her head tilted almost imperceptibly. Her golden eyes weren't on them, but were scanning the deep shadows just behind and to the side of where they sat.

Vera, recovering first, picked up the thread. "The poultice... it uses moss that grows on the north side of ironwood trees. It helps mask the scent." Her voice was steady, a testament to her own discipline.

As she spoke, Lyra's body remained a study in stillness. Only her eyes moved, tracking something unseen in the oppressive dark. Seconds stretched, thick with unspoken tension. Then, her posture shifted. It wasn't a large movement, but a gathering of energy, a predator coiling.

Her hands, which had been resting in her lap, blurred into motion, dropping to the small of her back.

_Swoosh. Swoosh._

The sound was like a sharp, sudden exhale of air. Two slivers of black steel sliced through the firelight and vanished into the darkness. They were followed an instant later by two distinct, wet _thuds_ and the heavy sound of bodies collapsing onto the forest floor.

Silence.

Vera and Aldwin were frozen, staring at Lyra, who was already on her feet and moving silently toward the source of the sound.

"Two," she called back, her voice once again a calm, professional report. "Silent Hand patrol. They were twenty feet out. Badly concealed." She retrieved her kukri blades with practiced efficiency. "Threat neutralized. You can stop talking now."

She glanced at Echo, who had settled back onto his perch, and gave the raven a small nod. "Good eyes, Echo." Her gaze moved to Vera. "And good instincts. That warning gave me the positioning I needed."

Vera slowly set down her whetstone, her hands steadier than her voice. "Twenty feet. They were twenty feet away."

"And we had no idea," Aldwin murmured, his medical notes forgotten in his lap. "How long were they watching us?"

"Long enough," Vera said grimly. She glanced at Lyra's retreating form. "Good thing someone was."
