The Wayward Compass kept a steady murmur even when the road went quiet. Tonight, the murmur had an edge.

"Word is, a ledger walked out of Stonebridge on two feet and a prayer," a caravan drover said to his tablemates, keeping his voice low though the whole table leaned in. "Walked straight past three men who never saw it leave."

"Three?" scoffed a woman in traveling leathers. "Try five, and a clerk who suddenly couldn't count past ten when asked about shipment weights."

Durja polished a tankard until it gleamed. "Counting gets tricky when your arithmetic changes hands," she said dryly, sliding the drink to a patron who pretended not to be listening.

In the alcove, a man with too many pockets folded a square of paper once, twice, then passed it to the serving girl with a smile that said nothing at all. Marcus Heartbridge never hurried. The note vanished like steam.

From the far corner, two silhouettes could have been shadows arranged to look like people—one scarred, one straight-backed. Their voices did not carry, but the lantern on their table burned steadily, the flame barely flickering no matter who opened the door.

"Funny thing about ledgers," the drover added. "Sometimes they're heavier than they look. Sometimes they weigh a man down for years." 

No one contradicted him.

On page three of the Waterdeep Chronicle, beneath advertisements for winter cloaks and apprenticeships, a column of "Small Notices" carried more weight than most headlines.

— Trade Irregularities in Stonebridge: The Merchant Council assures citizens of a swift internal review. No disruptions to shipments are expected. 

— Warehouse Registry Misfiling: A clerical error has been identified and corrected. All parties remain in good standing.

— Missing Ledger Pages: Unfortunate. Routine. Nothing to see.

Tennison Quill set a thin line of ink to dry and did not smile. Clerk Dena, reading over his shoulder, tapped the empty space where an official quote should have been.

"Sometimes what we don't print is the story," she murmured.

"Sometimes it's the blank we leave for someone else to fill," he replied, and moved the piece to layout.

Master,

Per your inquiry: the cylinder you sent is not standard coastal make. The wards are arrayed for torque in a concentric negative pattern—old mountain work, the sort favored by fortresses that expected to outlive their masons. It mates to something that wants to be turned by more than a hand. A winch might do. Or a key the size of a man's forearm.

The alloy resists ordinary filings and holds a strange hum when struck. Not arcane—at least not only. You asked if it was honest. It is precise. Honesty belongs to its bearer.

If you must know my guess: the cylinder is a lock without a door yet found. Find the door, and the rest will insist on revealing itself.

Respectfully,

— H. Bram, Third Bench, Locksmiths' Row

Entry 44: Vexweld Innovations—crating labeled 'survey assemblies' (non-weapon). Routed via two shells to North Pass. Driver briefed on silence. Payment in triplicate, delivery on thaw.

Entry 45: Hardware, oversized—hinges, couplers, chain. Destination unclear; consignee uses the same seal as Entry 44, counter-signed by a hand that prefers expensive ink.

Entry 46: Return courier—one parcel only, declared as 'component'. Small, heavy, insured.

In the margin, a neat sigil indicated confidence. In another margin, later, a different sigil replaced it—a mark brokers made when a job had suddenly become more interesting and less safe.

The alcove's lantern burned lower now, wick trimmed to a patient glow. Thorne slid a plain cloth pouch across the table; Veyra rested her palm on it as if to steady something that did not want steadying.

"A lock without a door," she said softly.

"Or a door that finally remembered its lock," Thorne offered.

She considered the maps in her head and the ones she did not yet have. "We don't force doors. We read the walls until they tell us where to push."

Outside, the Wayward Compass breathed with the road. Inside, two people who had learned to count cost as carefully as coin let the silence make room for a future that had shape but not yet a name.
