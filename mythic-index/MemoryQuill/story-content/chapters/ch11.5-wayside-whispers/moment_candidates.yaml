Every visual element converges: the lantern motif at its dimmest, the keys-and-locks metaphor made tactile, two characters whose partnership is defined by what they DON'T say. Veyra's restraint—palm on pouch, not inside it—is the visual thesis of her leadership: she gathers information before acting. The dying light suggests an ending and a beginning."
