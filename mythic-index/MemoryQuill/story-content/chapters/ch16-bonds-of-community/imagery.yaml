      Veyra leans against a worn stone wall in the damaged courtyard, her injured
      arm in a sling, watching the scene before her with visible emotion on her
      scarred face. In the middle distance, children from different settlements
      play together—little Sara teaching a Stonebridge boy to stack blocks—while
      their parents work side by side unloading wagons and tending repairs. Marcus
      stands beside Veyra, his usually immaculate clothes disheveled, both of them
      witnessing this transformation of a damaged fortress into a living community.
      Golden afternoon light catches dust motes and turns the scene warm.
