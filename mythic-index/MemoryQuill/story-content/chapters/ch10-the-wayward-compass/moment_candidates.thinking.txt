Let me analyze this chapter systematically using the Five Lenses framework.

## Chapter Overview
Chapter 10 "The Wayward Compass" follows the Last Light Company on a supply run that gets interrupted by:
1. A rescue of two merchants attacked by bandits
2. Arrival at the Wayward Compass inn
3. A confrontation with the Black Hawks mercenaries
4. Introduction of Marcus Heartbridge as an information broker

## Key Scenes:
- scn-10-01: The Trade Way (journey, dust, logistics discussion, scream)
- scn-10-02: Blood on the Road (rescue scene, cart wreckage, wounded merchants)
- scn-10-03: The Wayward Compass (inn arrival, treating wounded, Durja introduction)
- scn-10-04: The Confrontation (Black Hawks enter, standoff, Marcus's intervention)
- scn-10-05: A Calculated Overture (Marcus's pitch, information trading, Netherese coin)

## Visual Thesis
From the warm camaraderie of the dusty road to the cold tension of a standoff, then pivoting to the intriguing shadows of information warfare.

## Identifying Candidate Moments

### Scene 1 - Trade Way
Potential moments:
1. The dusty road - convoy traveling (generic, low visual distinctiveness)
2. The scream cutting through the air (too internal/auditory, not visual)

### Scene 2 - Blood on the Road
Potential moments:
1. **The overturned cart with scattered colored wool like blood** - STRONG
   - Emotional: 3 (tense but controlled)
   - Visual Distinctiveness: 5 (vibrant wool pools resembling blood - unique)
   - Narrative Pivot: 4 (triggers rescue)
   - Character Revelation: 3 (shows Company's coordination)
   - Symbolic: 4 (commerce destroyed, blood and color intermingled)
   - Total: 19

I'll continue analyzing the rescue moment's potential visual impact. Veyra's action of pulling the woman from the wreckage emerges as a compelling scene with significant narrative weight. The physical rescue demonstrates character depth, showing the Company's commitment beyond mere logistics. Her deliberate movement through debris creates a powerful visual metaphor of hope emerging from destruction. The scene scores well across emotional and character dimensions, particularly highlighting Veyra's decisive nature and the team's humanitarian instincts.

The medical treatment by Fayne, while important, lacks the same visual dynamism. It represents a more routine aspect of the Company's operations, blending into the background compared to the more striking rescue moment.

### Scene 3 - Wayward Compass Entrance
The inn's entry presents intriguing atmospheric potential. Silhouettes against the doorway, blood-covered figures entering - these visual elements suggest tension and unresolved conflict. The scene's symbolic undertones hint at transformation and survival, with light and shadow playing crucial roles in establishing mood.

Durja's assessment moment carries substantial character weight. Two scarred women recognize each other, their shared history etched into their physical marks. The orc behind the bar provides additional textural context, while the exchange of coins symbolizes a transactional sanctuary - survival has its price.

### Scene 4 - The Confrontation
The Black Hawks' entrance dramatically shifts the atmosphere. Their predatory movement causes patrons to press against walls, creating a visceral sense of threat. This moment symbolizes power dynamics, with the Hawks moving like wolves among sheep.

Veyra's defiant stance becomes a pivotal visual statement. Her burns catch the light, transforming her physical scars into something transcendent. This is not just a character moment, but a profound statement of survival and resilience.

Thorne positions himself protectively, embodying the classic defensive stance. His physical positioning reveals his role as a protective bulwark, ready to shield those he considers his own.

Marcus's entrance becomes the scene's dramatic apex. Moving from shadow to light, his theatrical introduction represents a perfect archetype reveal. His movement symbolizes an intricate dance between information and physical presence, with each step changing the scene's entire dynamic.

### Scene 5 - The Overture
The Netherese coin gleams with ancient promise, a tangible plot hook representing wealth, power, and potential threat. Its symbolic weight far exceeds its physical presence.

Marcus's mysterious exit maintains his enigmatic persona, slipping back into shadows as quickly as he emerged. His departure leaves more questions than answers, a deliberate narrative technique.

The scene captures multiple narrative layers: geographic movement along the Trade Way, character interactions at the Wayward Compass, and complex interpersonal dynamics between scarred, experienced individuals who recognize each other's histories.

Key moments span visual, emotional, and symbolic territories - from scattered wool suggesting violence to silent recognitions between battle-tested women. The selection emphasizes pivotal transitions: characters emerging from shadows, predatory groups entering spaces, intimate revelations through physical details.

The six chosen moments create a nuanced narrative progression, balancing wide establishing shots with deeply personal character revelations. Each moment serves a distinct narrative function: setting mood, revealing character depth, highlighting action, and suggesting underlying tensions.

The scene sequence moves through escalating intensity - from road rescue to inn arrival to confrontational dynamics, each moment carefully selected to build narrative momentum.

I'm mapping key visual and emotional beats across scene transitions. The confrontation scene represents the chapter's visual peak, so multiple moments can effectively capture its complexity. My selection balances visual hooks, character interactions, and symbolic details.

I've curated six moments spanning two scenes, ensuring thematic variety while maintaining narrative flow. Each moment serves a distinct narrative purpose - from establishing heroic context to revealing interpersonal tensions and pivotal character transformations.

The selection strategically distributes moments across scene progression, avoiding repetitive information while highlighting critical narrative turning points. By selecting moments that showcase action, character depth, and symbolic significance, I'm creating a nuanced chapter progression.

My current challenge involves refining the sequence to prioritize the protagonist's most powerful character moment while maintaining scene diversity and emotional impact.

I'm restructuring the moments to highlight visual distinctiveness, ensuring each beat reveals something critical about character or narrative progression. The new sequence emphasizes Veyra's journey through evocative, spatially varied scenes - from road to inn - with symbolic and emotional weight.

The revised progression captures key transformative instances: wool like blood, rescue dynamics, character assessments, narrative pivots, and symbolic details. Each moment serves multiple narrative functions - establishing hero, revealing character, shifting mood, introducing tension.

By carefully selecting these six moments, I create a compelling visual narrative arc that tracks Veyra's resilience, the scene's mounting complexity, and the underlying symbolic tensions driving the story forward.
