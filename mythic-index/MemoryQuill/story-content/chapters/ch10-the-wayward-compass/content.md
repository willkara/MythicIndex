The supply run had been planned for weeks, but necessity made it urgent. Two days out from the Westwall Watchpost, the heavy wagons groaned under their loads—one full of trade goods cobbled together from their recent missions, the other empty but for the hope of filling it with desperately needed supplies. The Trade Way stretched before them, more suggestion than road after the winter's abuse.

The dust rose with every step, coating them in a uniform layer of grime that worked its way into every gap in their armor, every fold of cloth. It mixed with sweat to form a paste that itched and burned. The horses' flanks were streaked with it, their breathing labored in the unseasonable warmth that had followed the harsh winter.

"This road's a disgrace," Grimjaw Ironbeard grumbled for the third time that morning, his voice carrying that particular dwarven ability to convey centuries of grievance in a single sentence. He gestured with a thick thumb at a pothole that could have swallowed a small child. "In my grandfather's day, the trade guilds kept the main arteries paved and proper. Stone that would last generations. This?" He spat, the dust turning it to mud before it hit the ground. "This is what happens when merchants care more for their coffers than their routes."

Riding beside him, Quartermaster Fayne consulted his scroll of parchment, squinting through the dust. The list seemed to grow longer with each reading. "Mistress Elba's requirements alone would stock a small army. Specialty grains from the Southern kingdoms, preserving salts from the Moonsea, a new cauldron—apparently the old one has developed a crack that 'sings death songs when heated.' Her words, not mine."

"We're becoming an army," Thorne Brightward commented, his eyes never stopping their methodical scan of the wooded verges. The trees pressed close here, perfect for ambush. His hand rested casual on his sword pommel, but his knuckles were white. "An army needs supplies. And after yesterday's inventory..." He shook his head. "We're down to dried meat and whatever Vera's ravens can catch."

"We also need proper logistical tools," Fayne added, rolling up the list before the dust could ruin it completely. "Surveyor's kits for scouting new locations, fresh ledgers since mine are full, reliable maps of the northern territories. We can't keep operating on rumor and memory."

Veyra Thornwake rode at the head of their small column, her scarred face set in concentration. She hadn't spoken for the last hour, her mind clearly elsewhere—perhaps on the conversation with Thorne two nights past about finding a proper headquarters. The supply run was necessary, a problem to be solved, but it was also a means to an end. Every barrel of salt, every bolt of canvas, was a step toward the future they'd discussed on the parapet. A proper home.

The sun climbed higher, and with it came the insects—clouds of gnats that found every exposed bit of skin, horseflies that tormented the animals into stamping and head-tossing. They'd started before dawn to avoid the worst of the heat, but spring was asserting itself with unusual vigor.

"How much further to the crossroads?" Fayne asked, swatting at a particularly persistent fly.

"Two hours, maybe three if this heat keeps building," Thorne replied. "We'll rest the horses at the inn, water them properly. The Wayward Compass usually keeps decent ale, if nothing else."

It was then that they heard it—a woman's scream, sharp with terror, cutting through the afternoon stillness like a blade through silk.

The overturned cart lay skewed across the road like a broken toy, its cargo of dyed wool scattered in vibrant pools of color that looked disturbingly like blood in the harsh sunlight. The actual blood was there too, darker, spreading from beneath the wreckage where someone was trapped.

They didn't need to speak. Four people who'd learned to work together in cramped quarters moved with the fluid efficiency of those who could predict each other's actions. Thorne raised a hand, signaling a halt, and was already dismounting, his sword clearing its sheath with a whisper of steel. The others followed suit, boots hitting the dusty ground in near unison.

"Perimeter," Veyra said quietly, though Thorne was already moving to scan for threats, his trained eye reading the scene like a report.

A young woman was pinned beneath the wreckage, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps. Her dress—once fine blue wool—was torn and dusty, her face pale with pain and fear. A Tabaxi merchant lay nearby, his spotted fur matted with dust and darker stains, clutching his thigh where a crossbow bolt protruded. His feline features were contorted with pain, ears flattened against his skull, but his amber eyes remained sharp even as blood seeped between his clawed fingers.

"Help us," the Tabaxi groaned, his voice a low rumble that retained its cultured cadence despite the agony. "Please, they took everything. My niece, she's—"

"Save your strength," Fayne said, already at his side with medical supplies. His hands moved with the steady efficiency of someone who'd treated wounds in worse conditions. "This will hurt." Without waiting for a response, he snapped the bolt's shaft, leaving the head in place to prevent worse bleeding. The man's scream was muffled by the leather strip Fayne shoved between his teeth.

Meanwhile, Veyra and Grimjaw assessed the cart. "It's not just overturned," Veyra observed, noting the axe marks on the wheels. Her lantern's light seemed to catch on details others might miss—scuff marks in the dirt showing the attackers' positions, the particular angle of the axe cuts. "They crippled it first, then pushed it over."

"Smart," Grimjaw grunted, positioning himself at the cart's corner. "Make sure the victims can't flee, then take their time with the robbery." He studied the angles, found his leverage point. "Here. Lift on my count, but watch for shifting. This thing comes down wrong, it'll crush her proper."

There was no wasted motion. On Grimjaw's count, he and Thorne lifted while Veyra guided the woman clear. The cart crashed back down, sending up a cloud of dust that set everyone coughing.

"Broken ribs, looks like," Fayne said after a quick examination of the woman. "Maybe internal bruising. She needs proper healing, soon."

The inn squatted at the junction of trade roads like a toad made of timber and stone, solid and unlovely but undeniably present. Smoke rose from three chimneys, and the sound of voices drifted through the open windows—a mix of laughter, argument, and the clink of pewter on wood. The sign above the door showed a compass rose with its needle spinning wildly, paint peeling but still legible.

The arrival of the Company with two injured civilians caused a stir. Conversations died mid-word as they entered, the afternoon sunlight following them in to highlight the blood on their clothes, the dust of hard travel, the weapons worn with casual familiarity.

The interior was exactly what you'd expect from a crossroads inn—low-beamed, smoky, and crammed with mismatched furniture that had seen better decades. The air was thick with the smells of stale ale, roasting meat, unwashed bodies, and that particular mixture of smoke, spilled drinks, and desperation that marked places where travelers paused but never stayed. Sawdust covered the floor, though it needed changing—dark stains showed where previous altercations had been resolved with more than words.

"We need a healer," Thorne announced to the room at large, supporting the wounded merchant.

The crowd parted, revealing the bar where a formidable female orc stood polishing a tankard with methodical precision. Scars crosshatched her arms, and one tusk was broken short. Her eyes—intelligent and calculating—took in the blood, the wounds, the weapons, and made a dozen assessments in the span of a breath.

"Durja runs a quiet house," she rumbled, her voice like gravel in a drum. "You bringing trouble to my door?"

"Trouble already found them," Veyra said, meeting the orc's gaze steadily. She slid silver coins across the bar—more than enough for rooms and healing. "We're just helping them find safety."

Durja's eyes flicked to the coins, then back to Veyra's scarred face. Something passed between them—recognition of a kindred spirit, perhaps, another woman who'd earned her scars the hard way. She pocketed the coins with one hand while gesturing with the other.

"Molly! Get the healer. Tell him it's paying customers, not charity." A serving girl scurried off. "The alcove near the kitchen," Durja continued, nodding toward a relatively private corner. "And keep it quiet. Some of my patrons prefer their drinking without blood as garnish."

They settled the injured pair at a table worn smooth by countless elbows. The healer—a nervous human with ink-stained fingers who clearly did more scholarly work than emergency medicine—arrived and began his ministrations with competent if uninspired efficiency.

The Company arranged themselves in a protective formation that looked casual but commanded all approaches to the table. It was habit now, born from too many ambushes, too many situations that had turned violent without warning. Thorne and Grimjaw took positions that controlled the main routes, while Fayne laid out his medical supplies to assist the healer.

"Thank you," the woman—Mira, they'd learned—whispered, her voice thin with pain but steady. "We thought... when they shot Uncle Sliba, we thought we were dead."

"Black Hawks don't usually leave witnesses," Sliba added, his leg propped on a stool as the healer worked. His tail flicked with agitation despite the pain, a tell that any card player would recognize. The bolt had been removed, and the wound packed with herbs that smelled sharp and medicinal. "They must have heard you coming."

"Black Hawks?" Grimjaw's eyebrows rose. "That's organized banditry, not random robbery. They're Zhentarim muscle, usually. Work for hire."

"Indeed," Sliba nodded, his whiskers twitching as the healer tightened a bandage. "Been hitting this road regularly. The local merchants have been trying to hire protection, but..." His ears flattened briefly, a feline shrug that conveyed volumes about the state of law enforcement this far from the city.

The serving girl brought ale—watered but cool—and bowls of stew that was mostly vegetables with suggestions of meat. The Company took their drinks with the quiet gratitude of travelers, though they barely touched the food. Too many years of bad road fare had taught them to be selective.

It was perhaps an hour after they'd arrived that Marcus Heartbridge decided to make his presence known.

He'd been watching from the moment they'd entered, of course. From his corner booth, shrouded in shadow and pipe smoke, he'd observed their entrance, catalogued their weapons, noted their formation, assessed their competence. The scarred woman intrigued him—her burns told a story of survival against impossible odds. The soldier beside her moved with the precision of city guard training but the flexibility of someone who'd learned to bend rules. The dwarf was obviously more than a simple warrior, the way his eyes assessed structure and stability. And the quartermaster... interesting. His hands were artist's hands, but the calluses spoke of weapons work.

The injured civilians were a complication he hadn't expected, but one that might work to his advantage. Nothing revealed character quite like how people treated the helpless.

When the door banged open again, admitting four new figures, Marcus set down his wine glass with a gentle click. This was about to become educational.

The Black Hawks entered like they owned the place—which, in a way, they did. Places like the Wayward Compass survived by not taking sides, and that neutrality was bought with the understanding that certain groups could operate without interference.

Their leader was a hulking orc with a flattened nose that had been broken so many times it was more suggestion than feature. His tusks were yellowed and filed to points, and his leather armor bore the crude black hawk insignia that gave them their name. The others spread out behind him—two humans and a half-orc, all carrying the kind of weapons that had seen hard use and would see more.

The inn's atmosphere changed instantly. Conversations didn't stop but dropped to whispers. Several patrons found urgent business elsewhere, coins left on tables as they headed for other exits. Durja continued polishing glasses, but her eyes tracked every movement.

The half-giant leader—Krag, Marcus knew, though he doubted the Company did—scanned the room with the slow, deliberate movement of a predator identifying prey. His gaze locked on Sliba and Mira, and his lips pulled back in what might generously be called a smile.

"Well, well. Seems you survived after all." His voice was rough, like he'd been gargling gravel. "That's unfortunate. Boss doesn't like loose ends."

Thorne was already on his feet, his movement smooth and unhurried. He positioned himself between the mercenaries and the table with the casual precision of someone who'd done this dance before. "They're under our protection. I suggest you turn around and find other business."

Krag laughed, a sound like grinding millstones. "Protection? You don't even know who you're protecting them from, soldier-boy. This ain't city business. This is Black Hawk business, and we don't leave witnesses."

"You do today," Veyra said, standing slowly. The movement drew attention to her scars, the way they caught the lamplight and turned her face into something otherworldly. Her voice was quiet, but it carried the weight of someone who'd faced down worse than street thugs and and lived. "Turn around. Walk away. This is your only warning."

The tension solidified like ice forming on water. Hands drifted to weapons. Grimjaw hefted his tankard—heavy pewter that would make a decent club—and shifted his weight. Fayne's hand had found his knife, though he hadn't drawn it yet.

The other patrons were pressing against walls now, trying to become invisible. Durja had stopped pretending to polish glasses and had both hands below the bar where she doubtless kept something persuasive.

Marcus decided it was time.

"Gentlemen," he said, his voice cutting through the tension like warm honey through ice.

Everyone turned. He'd pitched it perfectly—loud enough to demand attention but calm enough to avoid triggering violence. He rose from his booth with fluid grace, stepping into the light like an actor taking the stage. His clothes were expensive but travel-worn, suggesting wealth without ostentation. His hands were empty, spread slightly in a gesture of peace.

He walked past the Company as if they didn't exist, his attention focused entirely on Krag.

"I heard about the trouble in Daggerford," he said conversationally, as if discussing the weather. "Unfortunate business with that textile warehouse. The fire was particularly costly, I understand. Three thousand gold in Shou silk, wasn't it?"

Krag stiffened, his hand freezing halfway to his weapon. "Who in the hells are you?"

"Someone who knows things," Marcus replied, still smiling. "I know, for instance, that the shipment you're waiting for—the one with the Balduran steel—is arriving at sunset. Pier seven, if memory serves. The manifest lists it as farming equipment, very clever. Your employer will want you there to ensure smooth transfer."

The orc's face had gone pale beneath the dirt. "How do you—"

"I also know," Marcus continued, his voice dropping just enough that Krag had to lean in to hear, "that there's a particular letter in the harbor master's office. A letter that details certain financial arrangements. A letter that your employer would very much prefer remains unread by city authorities." He paused, letting that sink in. "Now, that letter could stay where it is, gathering dust. Or it could find its way to interested parties. That would depend entirely on what happens in the next thirty seconds."

The threat was silk-wrapped but unmistakable. Krag's eyes darted to his men, calculating odds, measuring risks. Marcus could see the moment he decided it wasn't worth it.

"This ain't over," Krag growled, but he was already backing toward the door.

"It never is," Marcus agreed pleasantly. "But for today, it's concluded. Do give my regards to your employer. Tell him the Heartbridge remembers his hospitality in Luskan."

The name hit like a crossbow bolt. Krag's eyes widened—everyone knew the Heartbridge family's reputation for information brokerage. They were the people you went to when you needed to know something, and the people you avoided when you had something to hide.

The Black Hawks retreated, casting nervous glances over their shoulders. The door slammed behind them, and the inn let out a collective breath it hadn't realized it was holding.

Marcus turned to the Company, his charming smile back in place. "My apologies for the interruption. They seemed rather intent on spoiling everyone's evening."

Thorne's hand hadn't left his sword hilt. "You know those men."

"I know _of_ them," Marcus corrected smoothly. "Information is my trade, Captain Brightward." His eyes flicked to the lantern insignia on Veyra's shoulder, a gesture so quick most would have missed it. "And you are the Last Light Company, if the whispers on the road are true."

Veyra studied him with those intense, scarred features. He could feel her assessment, the way she was cataloging everything about him—his stance, his clothes, the way he'd handled the confrontation without violence. "We are," she confirmed after a moment.

"Excellent." Marcus gestured to their table. "Might I join you? It seems we have overlapping interests, and frankly, the wine here is dreadful. I have something better."

From an inner pocket of his cloak—the movement was a magician's flourish, drawing the eye—he produced a dark bottle without label. "A private vintage from a monastery near Neverwinter. The monks take their vows seriously, especially the ones about quality."

He procured glasses from somewhere—Durja didn't object, which was interesting—and poured generous measures. The wine was deep red, almost black, and smelled of summer fruits and dark earth.

"To unexpected meetings," he said, raising his glass.

Grimjaw took a suspicious sip, then his eyebrows rose. "That's... that's actually good."

"I never lie about wine," Marcus said. "Or about information. Which brings us to business."

The atmosphere at the table had shifted from tension to wary curiosity. The injured merchants were being tended to in a corner, the healer fussing over bandages with renewed diligence now that violence had been averted. The inn gradually returned to its normal buzz of conversation, though people kept shooting glances at their table.

"Our interests are seeing these people to safety," Thorne said, his posture still rigid despite the wine. "Nothing more."

"Of course," Marcus agreed easily. "But your reputation precedes you. The Last Light Company—started from the ashes of tragedy, quite literally. You make a habit of being in the right place at the right time. The dock fire, the mine collapse, that unfortunate business with the frozen children last month. You're becoming quite the legend."

"You seem to know a lot about us," Veyra said, her voice carefully neutral.

"It's my business to know things," Marcus replied. "Just as it's your business to save people. And that's where our interests align." He leaned forward slightly, his voice taking on a confidential tone. "I know, for instance, that an enterprise like yours—effective, professional, and clearly growing—must be feeling the constraints of a borrowed watchtower. The Westwall Watchpost was never meant to house more than a dozen guards, yet you've got nearly twice that now."

Thorne's eyes narrowed. Fayne's hand had stilled on his journal where he'd been sketching. Grimjaw took another deep drink of wine but said nothing.

"Information is only valuable if it's accurate," Veyra said.

"Indeed." Marcus smiled. "So, as a gesture of goodwill, allow me to offer a piece of verifiable intelligence. You're heading to Stonebridge for supplies. When you get there, seek out a grain merchant named Silas Croft. He's well-respected, sits on the merchant council, contributes to all the right temples. He's also been short-weighting the city's shipments for months, selling the excess to... let's call them irregular buyers. The magistrate suspects but lacks proof."

He paused, swirling his wine. "That proof exists in his secondary ledger, which he keeps in a locked safe behind a frankly hideous tapestry depicting the Battle of the Bones. The combination, should anyone need it, is his daughter's birthday—third of Mirtul."

The silence at the table was profound. Finally, Thorne spoke. "Why tell us this?"

"Because I believe in mutually beneficial arrangements," Marcus said. "And because I have a problem that your unique skills are perfectly suited to solve. A problem that requires a more... direct approach than my own methods allow."

He placed a single, heavy gold coin on the table. It was old, the kind of old that suggested empires long fallen, and it gleamed with inner light that had nothing to do with the lamp's reflection.

"Consider this a retainer," he said. "I'll be in Stonebridge for the next two days, staying at the Gilded Gryphon under the name Carver. Verify my information. If it proves true, find me. We can discuss how you might return the favor."

He stood, the movement graceful despite the wine. "Oh, and Commander Thornwake?" He looked directly at Veyra. "The Silent Hand that your new tracker has been hunting? They're moving their spring shipment earlier than usual this year. The winter was hard, and they're eager to recoup losses. The northern route through Neverwinter Wood will be particularly active."

The name dropped into the conversation like a stone into still water. Veyra's face went very still, and Marcus could see he'd hit his mark.

"How do you know about—"

"Information, Commander. It's what I do." He bowed slightly. "Until Stonebridge, then."

He melted back into the shadows of the inn, leaving the Company staring at the gold coin on the table. It seemed to pulse with possibility and threat in equal measure.

Grimjaw broke the silence. "I don't trust him."

"Neither do I," Veyra said. "But if he's right about the Silent Hand..."

"We verify the Croft information first," Thorne said practically. "If that's accurate, then we consider the rest."

Fayne had been examining the coin with artist's eyes. "This is pre-Spellplague. The empire of Netheril, if I'm right. It's worth... considerably more than its weight in gold."

"Everything has a price," Veyra murmured, but she pocketed the coin. "We leave at first light. The merchants can rest here tonight—Durja will see them safe."

As they prepared to retire, Durja approached their table, wiping her hands on her apron.

"That one," she said, nodding toward where Marcus had disappeared, "he's been here three days. Asking questions. Not just about trade routes and merchant councils, neither. Asking about the Hand, about patrol schedules, about quiet routes north." She lowered her voice. "He pays well and causes no trouble, but he brings a shadow with him. Be careful, that one trades in more than information."

The warning hung in the air as they climbed the narrow stairs to their rooms. Outside, night was falling, and somewhere in the darkness, Marcus Heartbridge was probably already three steps ahead of them, arranging pieces on a board only he could see.

But that was tomorrow's problem. Tonight, they had warm beds, decent wine in their bellies, and the knowledge that they'd saved two more lives from the road's casual cruelty.

It wasn't everything, but it was enough.

For now.
