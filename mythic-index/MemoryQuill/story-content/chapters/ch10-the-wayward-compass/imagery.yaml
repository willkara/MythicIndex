          Harsh afternoon sun bakes the Trade Way, more suggestion than road after
          winter's abuse. Dust rises with every step, coating everything in uniform
          grime. Potholes deep enough to swallow children. Heavy wagons groaning
          under loads. Heat-shimmer haze, clouds of gnats, horseflies tormenting
          animals. Unseasonable warmth following harsh winter. Trees press close

          Crossroads inn squatting at junction of trade roads—toad of timber and stone,
          solid and unlovely. Three chimneys smoking. Interior low-beamed, smoky,
          crammed with mismatched furniture that has seen better decades. Air thick
          with stale ale, roasting meat, unwashed bodies, smoke, spilled drinks, and
          desperation. Sawdust on floor needs changing—dark stains from previous
          altercations. Afternoon sunlight follows the Company in, highlighting blood
          on clothes and dust of hard travel. Corner booth shrouded in shadow and
          pipe smoke where Marcus watches. Tension crystallizes when Black Hawks enter—
          conversations drop to whispers, patrons press against walls trying to become
          invisible. Durja behind bar with calculating assessment.

      The Trade Way under harsh afternoon sun. An overturned merchant cart lies skewed
      across the dusty road, its cargo of dyed wool scattered in vibrant pools—crimson,
      indigo, saffron—that look disturbingly like splashed blood against the earth.
      The actual blood is there too, darker, spreading from beneath the wreckage where
      a young woman in torn blue wool is pinned. A Tabaxi merchant clutches his thigh
      where a crossbow bolt protrudes, his spotted fur matted with dust and blood.
      The Company approaches with purpose—Veyra dust-coated at the lead, Thorne already
      dismounting with hand on sword, Grimjaw and Fayne following. Four people moving
      as one, wordless coordination born of trust.

      Wide shot capturing the chaos of the scene. Cart as visual anchor in middle-ground,

      The smoky interior of the Wayward Compass inn. In a shadowed corner booth,
      Marcus Heartbridge sits half-visible, pipe smoke curling around him like a
      living thing. His expensive but travel-worn clothes catch what little light
      reaches his corner. A wine glass gleams in his hand, deep red almost black.
      His eyes—intelligent, calculating—are fixed on the Company's entrance.
      Through the smoke and shadow, we see them in the middle-ground: Veyra's scarred
      face catching the afternoon light from the door, blood on their clothes from
      the rescue, weapons worn with casual familiarity. Marcus's focus is on her—
      the scarred woman intrigues him most. A slight smile plays at his lips,
      the expression of someone who has just found an interesting piece on the board.

      The common room of the Wayward Compass, tension crystallized like ice forming
      on water. Krag the Black Hawks leader stands with yellowed tusks gleaming in
      lamplight, flattened nose a ruin, leather armor bearing the crude black hawk
      insignia. His thugs spread behind him—two humans and a half-orc.
      Facing them, the Company has formed without conscious thought: Thorne positioned
      between the mercenaries and the injured civilians, Veyra's scars catching light
      as she rises slowly, Grimjaw hefting his heavy pewter tankard like a weapon.
      Behind the bar, Durja has stopped polishing, both hands below the counter where
      she keeps something persuasive. Her intelligent eyes track every movement.
      Other patrons press against walls, trying to become invisible.
      The moment hangs—hands drifting to weapons, everyone calculating odds.

      Patrons as blur of retreat at edges. Stillness visible in every held breath.

      The moment of intervention. Marcus Heartbridge emerges from shadow into lamplight
      like an actor taking the stage. His fluid movement draws every eye in the room.
      Expensive clothes travel-worn but still elegant, hands empty and spread slightly
      in a gesture of peace. His smile is perfectly calibrated—charming, disarming,
      yet carrying an edge that makes Krag freeze mid-threat.
      The lamplight catches Marcus's face as he steps forward, transitioning from
      shadow to spotlight. Behind him, his corner booth still wisps with pipe smoke.
      All the previous tension redirects toward him—Krag's eyes widening, the Company
      pausing mid-preparation, even Durja's calculating gaze shifting to assess this
      new variable. His voice has just cut through the tension like warm honey through ice:
      "Gentlemen."

      not by weapons but by knowledge. The yellowed tusks that were threatening
      moments ago now seem smaller, less significant.
      Marcus's posture is relaxed, confident, while Krag's body language shifts to
      retreat. The other Black Hawks behind him have gone still, looking to their
      leader for guidance he can no longer provide.

      Ancient script circles its edge, half-worn but still legible to those
      who know old tongues. The gold has a depth modern coins lack.
      Around the coin, we see suggestions of hands: Marcus's elegant fingers
      having just placed it, Veyra's scarred hand nearby considering, Fayne's
      artist fingers itching to examine it. The worn wood of the table provides

      like liquid garnets.
      Marcus leans forward slightly, confidential, his voice taking on that
      intimate tone that makes listeners lean in despite themselves. The Company
      around the table—Veyra studying him with those intense scarred features,
      Thorne's posture still rigid despite the wine, Grimjaw's suspicious sip
      turning to raised eyebrows at the quality, Fayne examining the wine with

      eyes are fixed on Marcus, calculating, the burn scar catching lamplight.
      The information has hit like a physical blow.
      Marcus watches her reaction with satisfaction—he's found his mark. His
      expression shows the satisfaction of someone who has just demonstrated
      exactly how much they know. The wine glass still in hand, casual despite
      the weight of what he's just revealed.
      "The Silent Hand that your new tracker has been hunting? They're moving
      their spring shipment earlier than usual this year."
      The name hangs in the air like a ripple spreading through still water.

    visual_description: |
      Marcus melting back into the shadows of the inn, leaving the Company
      staring at the gold coin on the table. His silhouette dissolves into the
      smoky darkness from which he emerged, as if he was never quite there.
      The coin seems to pulse with possibility and threat in equal measure.
      Through the windows, evening light is fading. Night falls on the Wayward
      Compass, and somewhere in that darkness, Marcus Heartbridge is already
      three steps ahead, arranging pieces on a board only he can see.
      The Company remains at the table, the coin between them, decisions weighing.
      Durja watches from behind the bar with knowing eyes.

      composition creates sense of departure and uncertainty—what has been set
      in motion cannot be stopped.
