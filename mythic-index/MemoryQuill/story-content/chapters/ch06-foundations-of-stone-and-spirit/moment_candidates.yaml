    source_excerpts:
      - "As they prepared to leave, Veyra looked back at the grove, at the circle of ancient stones that had sheltered them. She placed her hand on one, feeling its cool surface, its incredible age."
      - "'Thank you,' she said quietly, not sure if she was thanking the stones or something greater."
      - "Grimjaw saw her do it and nodded approvingly. 'Now you're learning. Respect given is strength received. The mountain remembers everything, including gratitude.'"
    
    selection_rationale: "This SYMBOL moment shows Veyra's growth through action rather than dialogue. The visual of her scarred hand on ancient stone creates powerful symbolic density—fire-survivor touching time-survivor. It closes her arc in this chapter while opening her future development."
