      Extreme close-up of a scarred hand pressed against ancient granite stone.
      The hand shows burn scars, with a trail of teal ink tattoo names climbing
      from hand to wrist. Stone surface rough, ancient, touched with lichen.
      Dawn light makes both hand and stone glow rose-gold.
      Portrait framing, shallow depth of field, connection point as focus.
      Human impermanence meeting eternal stone, gratitude made tangible.

      The revelation of craft as character. The patrol expecting a hermit's hovel
      finds instead a masterwork—the cabin tells us everything about who built it.

    visual_description: |
      Wide establishing shot as the patrol crests the final rise. In the distance,
      Grimjaw's cabin is revealed—built directly into the mountainside, walls
      seamlessly blending stonework with natural rock face. Slate roof, glass
      windows catching evening light, water wheel turning in the stream. The
      patrol stops in surprise at the unexpected beauty. Evening light gilds
      the scene, smoke rising from the chimney. Mountains rise behind.
    composition_notes: |
      Wide landscape shot. Patrol in foreground (small, backs to viewer), cabin
      in middle ground as focal point. Mountain behind. Evening light creates
      warm glow on cabin. Rule of thirds places cabin at right intersection.
      Architecture as character study.
