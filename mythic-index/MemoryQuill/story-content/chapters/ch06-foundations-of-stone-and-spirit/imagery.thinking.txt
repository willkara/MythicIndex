Looking at the input, I have:

1. **Chapter Analysis** from the Visual Story Analyst with 7 candidate moments for Chapter 6: "Foundations of Stone and Spirit"
2. **Character Visual References** for all 9 characters appearing in this chapter

My job is to transform these into production-ready `imagery.yaml` with complete prompts, maintaining:
- Core oil painting style throughout
- Mood variation across the chapter
- Canonical character visuals (copied from sources)
- Proper structure for generation

Let me analyze the moments and assign moods:

**Moment Analysis:**

1. **Grimjaw's Cabin Reveal** (Hero) - "unexpected wonder" emotional color
   - Current mood progression in chapter: This is the first image
   - Setting: Mountain wilderness, evening light, architectural wonder
   - Narrative function: Wonder/discovery
   - **Suggested Mood: PASTORAL** (open landscape, discovery, relief after travel) with touches of wonder

2. **Workshop Interior with Meya figure** (Detail) - "preserved tenderness"
   - Setting: Interior, evening light through windows, domestic space
   - Narrative function: Character revelation through environment
   - **Suggested Mood: INTIMATE** (single warm source, tender, private)

3. **Grimjaw wrapping Meya's figure** (Anchor) - "sacred grief"
   - Setting: Interior, close focus, emotional weight
   - Narrative function: Loss/grief/letting go
   - **Suggested Mood: SOMBER** (emotional weight, chiaroscuro, tender grief)

4. **Stone in firelight philosophy** (Mood) - "contemplative wisdom"
   - Setting: Campfire at night, stone circle
   - Narrative function: Philosophical bonding, wisdom transmission
   - **Suggested Mood: CELEBRATORY** would be wrong here - this is contemplative
   - **Suggested Mood: INTIMATE** (quiet bonding, campfire warmth) or could argue for unique "contemplative" feel
   - Given it's around a fire with multiple people listening, and it's about wisdom sharing, I'll go **INTIMATE** for the tender knowledge transfer quality

5. **Tool maintenance oath scene** (Anchor) - "quiet oath"
   - Setting: Night watch, starlight, banked fire
   - Narrative function: Commitment, oath-swearing
   - **Suggested Mood: SOMBER** - this is weighty, sacred, oath-bound - but we just did somber
   - Actually, with starlight and the cosmic sense of the stone circle, could lean **ETHEREAL** - there's something transcendent about swearing to your dead wife

I'll explore the ethereal mood's potential for capturing the scene's profound emotional landscape, emphasizing the cosmic connection and sacred commitment.

6. **Veyra's hand on standing stone** (Symbol) - "earned wisdom"
   - The dawn setting and stone circle create a transcendent moment of spiritual significance
   - Her gesture symbolizes profound personal growth and connection to ancient knowledge
   - The ethereal mood captures the magical, transformative essence of her experience

7. **Company departure with glowing stones** (Hero) - "hopeful departure"
   - Morning light illuminates a triumphant journey's beginning
   - The stone circle serves as a powerful backdrop of completion and new beginnings
   - A sense of hope and victory permeates the departure scene

The mood distribution reveals a nuanced emotional landscape. Pastoral moments bookend the narrative, providing breathing room and hope. Intimate scenes explore tender connections, while ethereal and somber tones add depth and contemplative weight to the journey's progression.

Moment 4's celebratory atmosphere emerges through a warm, philosophical gathering. The scene evokes a genre painting's intimate energy - multiple listeners clustered around firelight, creating a convivial yet thoughtful environment. Amber tones and shared warmth define this communal experience, balancing intellectual discourse with human connection.

The revised mood distribution offers richer emotional texture, ensuring each moment contributes a distinct emotional resonance to the overall narrative arc.

For scene documentation, I'll track character-specific details like Thorne's post-rescue appearance - a new facial scrape and armor dusted from the mine incident. The custom image identification system will precisely map each visual representation, starting with the chapter's foundational scene.

The first image specification focuses on Grimjaw's cabin reveal, utilizing a cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio to capture the scene's expansive yet intimate mood.

I'll detail the workshop interior next, highlighting the carved Meya figure as a subtle emotional anchor. The image composition will emphasize character positioning and atmospheric nuance, with careful attention to lighting and character interactions.

The documentation continues with precise tracking of scene variations and visual narrative elements, ensuring each image contributes meaningful context to the chapter's emotional landscape.

The next scene shifts focus to Grimjaw's hands, capturing an intimate moment of delicate handling that reveals deeper emotional complexity. The close framing will emphasize the contrast between his massive physical presence and tender gesture.

The scene transitions to a symbolic moment centered on Veyra's hand, suggesting a profound connection to something larger - perhaps a standing stone representing spiritual or ancestral significance. The ethereal mood and centered composition hint at a transformative interaction beyond mere physical touch.

Grimjaw's background emerges through a scarred hand resting on ancient granite, revealing a history etched into weathered skin and stone. This image suggests deep personal history, resilience, and an intimate connection to the landscape.

The ensemble's departure becomes a cinematic tableau, with standing stones glowing mysteriously behind them - symbolizing an ancestral blessing or mystical transition into their journey. The pastoral mood and wide aspect ratio emphasize the collective movement and epic scale of their departure.

The scene demands a nuanced visual approach, blending naturalistic painting techniques with mythic undertones. Soft daylight, verdant greens, and warm golds will capture the ensemble's transition, creating a sense of breathing room and gentle narrative momentum.

For intimate moments, I'll draw on Vermeer's interior lighting - a single warm source casting tender shadow gradients, using amber and rose tones to suggest emotional depth. The composition will whisper rather than declare, maintaining a quiet poetic resonance.

When the mood turns somber, Rembrandt's chiaroscuro becomes essential. Muted earth tones like ochre and sienna will create atmospheric haze, with deep shadows conveying melancholy's weight. The palette speaks of 19th-century realism's profound emotional landscape.

Celebratory scenes require Dutch Golden Age warmth - multiple candlelight sources, rich burgundy and gold tones generating convivial energy. Genre painting's storytelling approach will infuse the moment with Jan Steen's characteristic liveliness.

For ethereal passages, Pre-Raphaelite luminosity guides the approach: sourceless soft glow, pale golds and silvers creating a dreamy atmosphere reminiscent of Maxfield Parrish's transcendent color harmonies.
