The air at the Blackvein Lode still tasted of rock dust and relief. The last of the rescued miners had been loaded onto wagons, Aldwin riding with the most severely injured to monitor their breathing—crushed ribs and stone-dust lungs needed careful watching. The sun was setting, painting the mountains in shades of copper and shadow, and the exhaustion of the day's events was settling into everyone's bones like lead.

Veyra stood at the mine entrance, watching the organized chaos of departure. Families were still arriving, having heard the news of the rescue. Each reunion was a small miracle—wives clutching husbands they'd thought lost, children lifted into arms that had nearly been stilled forever beneath tons of stone.

"Never gets old, does it?" Thorne said quietly, moving to stand beside her. His armor was gray with dust, and there was a new scrape across his cheek from where a falling stone had caught him.

"What doesn't?" Veyra asked, though she knew.

"Watching them go home," he replied. "Watching them get the second chance we're fighting for."

Grimjaw approached them, his pack somehow even more enormous now that he'd added various mining tools he'd confiscated from the site—"Criminal negligence to leave these with people who don't know how to use them," he'd grumbled. Despite his gruff manner, Veyra had noticed him quietly instructing several of the younger miners in proper support placement before they'd left.

"Your healer's not normal," Grimjaw said without preamble, nodding toward where Aldwin was gently adjusting a miner's position to ease his breathing.

"Neither are you," Veyra replied, a small smile touching her scarred lips.

"I mean it," Grimjaw pressed, his stone-deep eyes serious. "He sees death different. Not as an enemy. That's... unusual. Dangerous thinking for some."

"He sees it as a door, not a wall," Veyra said, remembering Aldwin's words from the plague village.

"Doors can be opened from both sides," Grimjaw muttered, but there was something in his tone—not quite disapproval, more like wary respect.

"That's what makes him valuable," Veyra said. "He understands both sides of that door. He can ease the passing for those who must go through, and fight to keep it closed for those who shouldn't."

Grimjaw grunted, which might have been agreement or simply acknowledgment. "We heading back to this Watchpost of yours?"

"After a detour," Veyra said. "You'll want your things from your cabin."

The dwarf's expression shifted, something vulnerable flashing across his weathered features before disappearing behind his usual gruffness. "Aye. Can't leave my tools with no one to tend them. They'd rust, and that'd be a crime worse than anything."

The path back up to Grimjaw's cabin was no easier in the evening light. If anything, the growing shadows made the deliberately difficult trail even more treacherous. But now they had Grimjaw himself leading them, and what had taken them hours before took barely one.

"Step here, not there," he instructed, his voice carrying back to the group. "That rock's loose on purpose. Looks stable, but it'd send you tumbling."

"You booby-trapped your own home?" Darric asked, breathing hard from the climb.

"Booby-trapped implies I want to hurt someone," Grimjaw corrected. "These are... discouragements. Big difference. A discouraged visitor goes home. A trapped one bleeds on my doorstep, and then I have to deal with the mess."

Aldwin, despite being the smallest of them, kept pace with surprising ease. Halflings, Veyra remembered, were often stronger than they looked. "How long have you lived here alone, Master Grimjaw?"

"Fifteen years, give or take," Grimjaw replied, not turning around. "Since the Mithral Deep incident."

"That was you?" Halden asked, awe creeping into his voice. "You're the one who saved the Goldbeard clan from the deep collapse?"

"Saved some," Grimjaw said tersely. "Not all. Never all."

The conversation died there, but Veyra filed the information away. Everyone in the Last Light Company carried their failures as much as their successes. It was what made them who they were.

As they crested the final rise, Grimjaw's cabin came into view, and several of them stopped in surprise. They'd expected a hermit's hovel, something rough and temporary. Instead, they found a masterwork of engineering.

-->

The cabin was built directly into the mountainside, its walls seamlessly blending stonework with natural rock face. The roof was slate, laid in a pattern that would shed snow and rain while providing perfect insulation. Windows—actual glass windows, not shutters—were positioned to catch morning light and avoid afternoon glare. A water wheel turned slowly in a diverted mountain stream, providing power to what looked like a grinding wheel inside a attached workshop.

"It's beautiful," Fayne said, their artist's eye appreciating the functional aesthetics.

"It's necessary," Grimjaw corrected, but Veyra could see the pleased flush above his beard. "Can't maintain tools without proper equipment. Can't maintain equipment without proper shelter. Can't maintain shelter without understanding stone and wood and water."

He pushed open the door—noting with satisfaction that none of them commented on the lack of locks. The discouragements on the trail were security enough.

Inside was a revelation. Tools lined every wall, each in its designated place, organized by function and frequency of use. A forge occupied one corner, cold now but clearly well-maintained. Shelves held jars of various oils and treatments for metal and leather. Books—dozens of them—filled a bookcase, their subjects ranging from geology to engineering to, surprisingly, philosophy.

"Meditations on Stone and Spirit," Aldwin read from one spine. "I have this same book."

"Good book," Grimjaw grunted. "Bit pretentious in places, but the author knew his business."

As Grimjaw began packing his tools with the careful attention of a parent handling children, Veyra noticed something else—the small touches that made this more than just a workshop. A kettle on the cold stove, well-used but clean. A single chair by the window, positioned to watch the sunset. A small carved figure on the mantle, a dwarf woman with a gentle smile.

"Your wife?" she asked gently.

Grimjaw's hands stilled for just a moment. "Was. The Mithral Deep took her along with half my clan. I heard the mountain's warning, tried to get them all out. Some listened. She stayed to help the stubborn ones." He resumed packing, his movements perhaps a bit more forceful. "Saved twelve more because of it. Died with thirty who wouldn't leave their gold."

"I'm sorry," Veyra said, and meant it.

"Don't be," Grimjaw said. "She died as she lived—trying to save fools from themselves. It's what we do, isn't it? What your company's about?"

"Yes," Veyra said simply.

Grimjaw nodded, then pulled out something unexpected—a small leather pouch that clinked with the sound of metal on metal. He opened it, revealing medals. Military medals, mining guild honors, civic commendations.

"Achievements," he said with something like disgust. "They give you these for doing what's necessary, as if it's extraordinary. As if keeping people alive is something special instead of the bare minimum of decency."

"Why keep them then?" Thorne asked.

Grimjaw was quiet for a moment, then: "To remember that what's necessary and what's celebrated ain't always the same thing. Your company—you're doing necessary work. Don't let anyone make it about glory."

"We won't," Veyra promised.

Grimjaw packed the medals at the very bottom of his bag, then began the serious business of selecting which tools to take. This was clearly a ritual, each tool examined, tested, either packed or carefully returned to its place.

"The mountain teaches patience," he said as he worked. "Can't rush stone. Can't force it. Every tool has its purpose, its moment. Bring the wrong one, people die. Leave the right one behind, people die." He held up a peculiar-looking hammer with a head that seemed to have multiple surfaces. "This one? Saved more lives than any sword ever did. Resonance hammer. Lets you hear what the stone's doing inside, where you can't see."

He packed it carefully, then continued. "That's what your company needs to understand. It's not about having the most tools or the strongest warriors. It's about having the right response for each crisis. Sometimes that's a sword. Sometimes it's tea and kind words. Sometimes it's knowing how to listen to what the problem's really saying."

As Grimjaw continued packing, the others helped where they could—Darric and Venn carrying the heavier items, Fayne carefully wrapping the more delicate instruments, Halden fascinated by the medical supplies Grimjaw had accumulated.

"These are surgical quality," Halden said, examining a set of precise cutting tools. "But they're meant for stone, not flesh."

"Same principle," Grimjaw said. "Remove what's killing, preserve what's healthy, know the difference. Stone or flesh, the philosophy's the same."

Aldwin had found a tea service—dwarven-made, sturdy but elegant—and was examining it with professional interest. "You perform ceremonies?"

"Did," Grimjaw admitted. "Dwarven tea ceremony's different from yours, halfling. It's about the stone's patience, the mountain's time. Brew it slow, drink it slower, let the heat seep into your bones like you're becoming part of the mountain yourself."

"I'd like to learn it," Aldwin said simply.

Grimjaw looked at him for a long moment. "Maybe I'll teach you. Been a while since anyone cared to know."

The packing took another hour. By the time they were done, Grimjaw had three massive packs, each organized with the same meticulous care as his workshop. He looked around the cabin one last time, his expression unreadable.

"Fifteen years," he said quietly. "Thought I'd die here. Thought that'd be fitting—old dwarf returning to the stone alone."

"Plans change," Veyra said. "Sometimes for the better."

"We'll see," Grimjaw said, but there was something lighter in his tone. He reached up to the mantle, taking the carved figure of his wife. This he wrapped personally, in soft cloth that smelled of lavender—preserved all these years.

"She would have liked you," he said to Veyra. "Meya always said the broken ones were the strongest, because they knew where the weak points were and reinforced them. You're all broken, aren't you? Your whole company?"

"Every one of us," Veyra confirmed without shame.

"Good," Grimjaw said firmly. "Can't trust someone who hasn't broken. They don't know their limits. Don't know what it costs to rebuild. Don't understand that strength isn't about never falling—it's about how you shore yourself up after."

They made camp that night in a sheltered grove Grimjaw knew, a place where ancient stones formed a natural circle and a clear spring bubbled up from deep underground. The dwarf insisted on checking the stone formation before allowing them to light a fire.

"Granite," he announced with satisfaction. "Good granite. Won't crack from the heat, won't hold moisture that could explode. People don't think about these things, but the stone remembers every fire that's been lit carelessly."

As they settled around the fire, the exhaustion of the day began to transform into something else—the quiet satisfaction of work well done. Venn had produced a small flask from somewhere, passing it around. Even Aldwin took a small sip, though he immediately began preparing his evening tea ceremony as well.

"So we have a commander, a captain, a healer, and an engineer," Darric said, counting on his fingers. "That's a good start."

"Sounds like the beginning of a bad joke," Venn quipped. "They walk into a tavern..."

"And the tavern falls down because the engineer notices the supports are wrong," Grimjaw finished, deadpan.

Everyone laughed, and it was the kind of laughter that came from shared danger survived.

Fayne began distributing the evening meal—travel rations supplemented with fresh bread from a village they'd passed. Grimjaw accepted his portion, broke off a piece of bread, and examined it with the same critical eye he'd used on the Blackvein Lode's support beams.

"Structurally sound," he announced, pressing his thumb into the crust. "Good air distribution in the crumb, proper ratio of crust to interior. Could use more salt, but the gluten development is adequate." He took a bite, chewed thoughtfully. "Seven out of ten. Would hold up in a pack for three days without going stale."

The others stared at him.

"You're... rating the bread?" Venn asked slowly.

"Everything has structure," Grimjaw said matter-of-factly. "Stone, timber, bread. Good engineering is good engineering, no matter the medium. This bread won't collapse under stress. That matters."

"It's just bread," Darric said, though he was grinning.

"There's no 'just' about it," Grimjaw replied seriously. "Bad bread can ruin a mission. Too dense, sits heavy in your stomach. Too light, no sustenance. Proper bread is about balance—like proper architecture. This baker understands their craft."

Thorne caught Veyra's eye, both of them fighting smiles. Their new engineer had opinions about everything, including dinner.

"What makes a company good?" Kelen asked, his deep voice thoughtful, clearly deciding to move past the bread critique. "I've served in many. Some were skilled but hollow. Others were family but couldn't function."

"Trust," Thorne said immediately. "Without trust, nothing else works."

"Purpose," Veyra added. "Shared purpose that everyone believes in."

"Compassion," Aldwin murmured, pouring water for his tea with practiced grace. "The ability to see suffering and want to ease it."

"Good tools," Grimjaw said, then held up a hand as people started to laugh. "I'm serious! Tools matter. The right equipment, the right knowledge, the right skills. Compassion without competence just means you feel bad while people die."

"He's not wrong," Veyra said, watching the fire. "We need both. The will to help and the ability to actually do it."

"We'll need more than what we have," Thorne pointed out. "Four specialists aren't enough for what you're envisioning."

"We'll need scouts," Grimjaw said. "People who can find the lost before they're too lost to save."

"Negotiators," Fayne added. "Sometimes the rescue is talking someone out of a bad situation."

"Fighters," Darric said. "Because sometimes talking doesn't work."

"Infiltrators," Venn suggested. "People who can get in where others can't."

"What kind of people?" Halden asked. "Where do we find them?"

"The kind others won't work with," Veyra said, her scarred face thoughtful in the firelight. "The kind who've been written off, dismissed, abandoned. People who understand what it's like to be lost."

"Outcasts," Grimjaw said, understanding.

"Like us," Veyra confirmed.

"The lost leading the lost," Aldwin said softly, his tea now ready, the scent of herbs mixing with woodsmoke.

"To where?" Thorne asked, though his tone suggested he already knew the answer.

"Home," Veyra said, the word carrying weight. "Always home. Even if we have to build it ourselves, one rescue at a time."

As the evening deepened, the formal discussion gave way to something more natural—the sharing of stories that happens when people begin to trust each other. It started with Venn telling a ridiculous story about a rescue that went wrong because a noble's pet peacock wouldn't stop attacking the rescuers.

"The damn bird thought we were rivals," he said, gesturing dramatically. "There we are, trying to pull this lordling out of a collapsed wine cellar, and this peacock is going for our eyes. Darric finally had to throw his cloak over it."

"It was a very expensive cloak," Darric added mournfully. "The bird shredded it."

Even Grimjaw chuckled at that, the sound like distant thunder.

"I rescued a cat once," the dwarf admitted, surprising everyone. "Not on purpose, mind you. Was shoring up a basement wall, and this cat had gotten itself stuck in the support beams. Mangy thing, all claws and spite. Scratched me bloody when I pulled it out." He paused. "Followed me home after. Lived with me for six years, that cat. Meanest creature you ever saw, but it knew I'd saved it. Used to bring me dead mice like it was paying rent."

"What happened to it?" Aldwin asked gently.

"Got old. Got sick. I made it comfortable at the end." Grimjaw's voice was gruff. "Even buried it proper, with a stone marker and everything. 'Here lies Spite, who paid his debts.' Probably the only friend I had these last years."

"You made a grave marker for a cat?" Fayne asked, but their tone was understanding, not mocking.

"Everything that lives deserves to be remembered," Grimjaw said firmly. "That's what the stone teaches. It remembers everything—every life that walked on it, every root that cracked it, every rain that wore it down. We're all just temporary arrangements of matter, but the memory... that can last."

"Is that why you became an engineer?" Veyra asked. "To build things that last?"

Grimjaw considered this. "Maybe. Or maybe to understand why things fall. My grandmother, she was a stone-singer. Could feel earthquakes days before they came. Said the mountain was always talking, but most folk were too loud to listen. She taught me to be quiet. To pay attention. To feel the weight of things—not just physical weight, but the weight of consequence, of time, of responsibility."

He picked up a stone from the ground, turned it in his hands. "This stone's older than any kingdom. It's seen the rise and fall of everything we think matters. But it's also just a stone. The trick is holding both truths at once—the eternal and the immediate. That's what your company needs to do. See the big picture while saving the individual life."

"Philosophy from a dwarf," Thorne said with a smile. "The world's full of surprises."

"Every dwarf's a philosopher," Grimjaw retorted. "We just express it through engineering. What's a bridge but philosophy made manifest? A statement that says 'this gap should be crossed.' What's a support beam but an argument against entropy?"

They set watches, old military habit even in relative safety. Veyra took the first watch with Grimjaw, sitting in companionable silence as the others slept. The dwarf had produced a small whetstone and was maintaining his tools with the same careful attention Aldwin gave to his tea ceremonies.

"You know this won't be easy," Grimjaw said quietly, not looking up from his work. "Building something new never is. The world likes its patterns, its categories. A rescue company that takes anyone, saves anyone—people won't understand it."

"They don't need to understand it," Veyra replied. "They just need to know we'll come when called."

"And when we're called to help someone others think doesn't deserve it? A thief? A killer? Someone who brought disaster on themselves?"

"Everyone deserves a chance to survive their worst moment," Veyra said firmly. "That's not negotiable."

Grimjaw nodded slowly. "Your healer thinks the same way. Saw it in how he tends everyone equal—the noble and the commoner, the kind and the cruel. That's rare."

"That's necessary," Veyra corrected. "The moment we start deciding who deserves rescue and who doesn't, we become judges instead of saviors. That's not our role."

"The stone doesn't judge," Grimjaw agreed. "It falls on the good and evil alike. We're just here to pull people out from under it."

They sat in silence for a while, watching the stars wheel overhead. Then Grimjaw spoke again: "My wife would have understood this. What you're building. She always said the point of strength was to lift others. The point of knowledge was to teach. The point of life was to ease the path for those who came after."

"She sounds wise."

"She was better than wise. She was kind. Kindness without weakness, strength without cruelty. That's what you're trying to build, isn't it? A place for that kind of strength?"

"Yes," Veyra said simply.

"Then I'll help you build it," Grimjaw said, and it had the weight of an oath. "Not for glory or gold, but because Meya would have wanted me to. Because sitting alone on a mountain preserving my pain isn't honoring her memory—using what I know to save others is."

The watch changed, Thorne and Aldwin taking over. Then Darric and Venn. As dawn approached, painting the sky in shades of rose and gold, the camp stirred. Aldwin was already preparing morning tea, the ritual as much a part of him as breathing.

"We should reach the Westwall Watchpost by midday," Thorne announced, consulting his mental map.

"Good," Grimjaw said, hefting his packs with ease despite their weight. "I want to see this Watchpost of yours. Assess the structural integrity. Probably needs work if it's as old as you say."

"It's... functional," Veyra said diplomatically.

"Functional's not enough," Grimjaw stated. "It needs to be home. Home for the broken, the lost, the ones who don't fit elsewhere. Can't build that on a shaky foundation."

As they prepared to leave, Veyra looked back at the grove, at the circle of ancient stones that had sheltered them. She placed her hand on one, feeling its cool surface, its incredible age.

"Thank you," she said quietly, not sure if she was thanking the stones or something greater.

Grimjaw saw her do it and nodded approvingly. "Now you're learning. Respect given is strength received. The mountain remembers everything, including gratitude."

They set off down the path, the Last Light Company plus one—or perhaps plus the foundation they'd been missing. Behind them, the morning sun struck the stones, making them glow like promises of permanence in a changing world.

The company had found its foundation. Now, as Grimjaw had said, they could truly begin to build.
