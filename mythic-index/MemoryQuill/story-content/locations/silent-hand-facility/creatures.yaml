creatures:
  - name: Suppression Leech
    description: Parasitic creatures born from the magical suppression compounds in the water system. They attach to magic users and drain their abilities while causing intense pain. The Silent Hand uses them as "living restraints" on prisoners, though they're becoming harder to control as mutations accelerate.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent bodies 6-12 inches long filled with glowing green fluid
      - Lamprey-like mouths with concentric rings of crystalline teeth
      - Bodies pulse with the same sickly light as suppression compound
      - Leave chemical burns where they attach
      - Multiply through budding when exposed to high magical energy
    habitat:
      where: Water systems, cisterns, and dampest parts of the underground prison
      when: Most active when feeding on magical beings; dormant in pure suppression water
      why: Created accidentally by suppression compound exposure; now self-sustaining
    behavior:
      who: Reproduce rapidly; population controlled only by guards' culling
      what: Seek out and attach to any source of magical energy
      how: Drain magic painfully; transmit dulling toxins into bloodstream
    lore: They were an accident—the compound was never meant to create life. Now they're indispensable for controlling powerful prisoners. Silent Hand alchemists worry they're evolving intelligence. Some leeches have started refusing to detach on command.

  - name: Garden Doppelganger
    description: Mutated plant growths in the conservatory that mimic the appearance of normal specimens while being fundamentally wrong. They were once legitimate research plants but absorbed so much suppression compound that they've become twisted parodies. They spread contamination to anything that touches them.
    visual_aspects:
      - Appear as normal plants but with subtle wrongness—too-perfect symmetry
      - Flowers that bloom in impossible colors with fractal patterns
      - Leaves that move against wind, reaching toward living beings
      - Roots visible through soil, forming geometric rather than organic patterns
      - Secrete the same glowing compound that created them
    habitat:
      where: Conservatory beds and experimental plots
      when: Grow aggressively; some plots must be burned back weekly
      why: Corrupted by long-term exposure to suppression compounds in water
    behavior:
      who: Individual plants but showing signs of networked awareness
      what: Spread contamination; attempt to "convert" normal plants nearby
      how: Release spores carrying suppression compounds; roots invade neighboring plots
    lore: The head botanist's private notes reveal panic: "They're not responding to pruning. Plot 7 regrew overnight. Found geometric patterns in the root structure that match nothing in nature. Request permission to burn everything and start over." Permission was denied. Plot 7 now covers a quarter of the conservatory.

  - name: Echo Prisoner
    description: Spectral imprints of prisoners who died in the facility, caught between death and the suppression field's interference with normal spirit transition. They endlessly repeat their final moments, creating a haunting cacophony in the deepest cells. Guards avoid certain wings entirely at night.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent figures in various states of despair and pain
      - Appear in the same positions and performing same actions endlessly
      - Glow faintly with suppression compound's green light
      - Sometimes multiple Echoes overlap in the same space
      - Silent screams visible but inaudible, though emotions are palpable
    habitat:
      where: Old cell blocks, especially where deaths occurred
      when: Visible constantly but more distinct in darkness
      why: Suppression field prevented normal death transition; trapped between states
    behavior:
      who: Individual spirits locked in final moments, unable to rest or move on
      what: Reenact deaths, torture, despair in endless loops
      how: Passive but deeply disturbing; presence causes nightmares and dread
    lore: New guards are never warned. They discover the Echoes on their own, usually during a night patrol. Most request transfer within days. A few become obsessed, trying to catalog and identify every Echo. One guard went mad trying to free them and drowned himself in a cistern. He's down there now, endlessly drowning.

  - name: Facility Watcher
    description: Something ancient and aware in the facility's foundations, predating the Silent Hand's occupation. It observes everything through cracks in walls and ripples in water. Not hostile but profoundly alien. The Silent Hand doesn't know it exists, but it's been documenting their crimes in ways they can't understand.
    visual_aspects:
      - Never fully seen; only glimpses through gaps and reflections
      - Appears as clusters of eyes in stone, patterns in water flow
      - Sometimes visible as shadows moving against light sources
      - Leaves strange symbols in condensation and mineral deposits
      - Presence felt as pressure and awareness rather than sight
    habitat:
      where: Building foundations, deepest cisterns, ancient parts predating current facility
      when: Constant presence but rarely manifests overtly
      why: Unknown original purpose; now appears to be recording events
    behavior:
      who: Possibly single ancient entity or collective awareness
      what: Observes and records everything; leaves cryptic messages and warnings
      how: Manifests through existing materials; cannot or will not take direct action
    lore: Rill Vossari sensed it during water system reconnaissance, though she couldn't identify what she felt. Those with true magical sensitivity report a vast, patient awareness beneath the facility, watching and waiting. One escaped prisoner claimed it showed her the way out through symbols in the stone. The Silent Hand has never detected it.
