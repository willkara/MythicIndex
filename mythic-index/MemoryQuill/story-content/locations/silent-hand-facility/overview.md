# Silent Hand Facility - Overview

## Basic Information
- **Public Name**: Veridian Agronomics Research Center
- **Actual Purpose**: Silent Hand Containment Facility
- **Type**: Legitimate Agricultural Research Center (Cover) / Black Site Prison (Reality)
- **Region**: Northern Waterdeep Outskirts
- **Coordinates/Position**: Approximately 10 miles outside the northern city gate, near a small lake fed by two streams
- **First Appearance**: Chapter 28
- **Significance Level**: Central

## Quick Description
A 50-acre hidden-valley estate presenting a polished country manor with a glass rotunda conservatory, formal gardens, and a water “research” plant—concealing an engineered suppression network, subgrade prison blocks, and terrain-integrated guard posts. Two streams converge near the estate core and feed a lake outfall; precision sluices, cisterns, and dosing vaults distribute suppression throughout the manor, conservatory, and utility galleries under the cover of environmental purity research.

## Visual Summary
- Manor: 3-storey stone house (slate roof, brick flues), public halls and staged labs over a hardened sub-basement (cells, intake, utility)
- Conservatory: 100 ft glass rotunda with observation gallery; “garden beds” hide access hatches; central suppression fountain/monitor
- Water Plant: Stone-clad hall masking subgrade cisterns, injection manifolds, and master valve room with sectional shutoffs
- Carriage/Security: Barracks, armory, comms, vehicle pit; concealed passage to manor basement
- Lakeworks: Boathouse, screened culverts, emergency egress tunnel; underwater probes disguised as “water quality” sensors
- Perimeter: Hunter blinds in northern forest; field storage/irrigation nodes with embedded optics; wrought-iron “specimen” fencing
- Networks: Service tunnels linking cores; slot drains, culverts, weirs; 23+ gated lines for pressure/flow control

## The Cover Story
**Veridian Agronomics** claims to cultivate the extremely rare and valuable "Silence Orchid" (Mystica silentium), a fictional flower that supposedly requires:
- **Magical Purity**: A completely sterile magical environment, free from ambient magical "pollution"
- **Precise Environmental Control**: Exact temperature, humidity, and nutrient delivery systems
- **High Security**: Protection from industrial espionage and theft due to the immense value of the plants and research

This cover story perfectly justifies every aspect of the facility's true security measures and containment systems.

## Public Reputation
- **Academic Circles**: Respected but secretive research institution
- **Business Community**: Successful boutique operation serving wealthy collectors and alchemists
- **Local Population**: Prestigious employer that brings jobs and prestige to the region
- **Authorities**: Legitimate business with proper permits and tax records

## Story Role
- **Plot Relevance**: 
  - *Main Story*: The primary target for the Last Light Company's first major intelligence operation under government oversight
  - *Cover Operation*: Central to the "Silent Hand" plot arc, representing the sophisticated threat of evil hiding behind legitimate facades
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Represents how evil can corrupt and weaponize good intentions; the perversion of institutions meant to nurture life into tools of imprisonment and suffering
- **Recurring Location**: [Yes]
- **Key Events Occurring Here**: 
  - *Public*: Groundbreaking research into magical horticulture and environmental purity
  - *Secret*: Systematic imprisonment, conditioning, and processing of magical captives for trafficking

## The Reality Behind the Facade
While Veridian Agronomics maintains an impeccable public front, intelligence gathered by government sources has revealed:
- **No Commercial Output**: Despite years of operation, no "Silence Orchids" have ever appeared in any market, private collection, or academic study
- **Excessive Security**: Security measures far beyond what any agricultural research would require
- **Victim Testimony**: At least one escaped captive has provided fragmented but compelling testimony about the facility's true nature
- **Financial Analysis**: Funding patterns that don't match legitimate research operations

## Connections
- **Connected Locations**:
  - *Waterdeep*: Close enough for convenient access and to maintain business relationships, far enough to avoid casual scrutiny
  - *Regional Waterways*: The streams and lake connect it to the regional water systems, used both for the cover story and for covert transportation
  - *Korrath Threnx & Cidrella Vexweld*: The unwitting engineers who designed and built the facility's sophisticated water and control systems

## Intelligence Status
- **What Authorities Know**: The facility is a front for Silent Hand operations
- **What They Don't Know**: Detailed internal layout, current prisoner count, operational schedules, security protocols
- **Intelligence Gap**: Sufficient detail to plan a successful non-lethal extraction operation

## Government Classification
- **Official Status**: Legitimate business under active but covert investigation
- **Operational Designation**: Priority Target Alpha for Joint Intelligence Protocol Seven
- **Action Authorization**: Reconnaissance approved; direct action pending additional intelligence gathering
