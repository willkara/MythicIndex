  - Detainees: 8–18 (suppressed, compartmentalized)
- Access Basis: Strict compartmentalization; badge rings and keyed doors; supervised line‑of‑movement; staged checkpoints and mantraps

## Space Usage (Who Uses Which Physical Areas)

- Perimeter Approaches and Thresholds
  - Users: Perimeter security posts; roving patrols; supply drivers (escorted)

  - Users: Shift sergeant and 2–4 guards; receiving clerk (cover)
  - Function: Identity verification, manifest intake, badge issuance, parcel inspection
  - Flow: Vehicles staged to inspection spur; foot traffic diverted to vestibule before interior

- Manor House (Public Floors – Cover Program)
  - Users: Research/admin staff; limited security shadows
  - Function: Legitimate façade zones (offices, salons, conference, dining)
  - Control: Visitor routes fixed; locked cross‑corridors; no unescorted movement past service doors

- Service Basement (Manor Sub‑Grade – Control Layer)
  - Users: Internal security; selected “maintenance” staff
  - Function: Access to mechanicals, comms risers, concealed routes to sub‑basement complex
  - Control: Two‑factor checkpoints; silent alarm plates; camera/observation slits into approach corridors

- Sub‑Basement Detention Complex (Primary)
  - Users: Internal security section; medical technician; observation operators
  - Function: Intake, holding, observation gallery, cell clusters, isolation rooms
  - Flow: One‑way movement from sally to cell corridors; med access via segregated spur; cleaning/service via back‑of‑house corridor
  - Safety: Emergency lamp racks; gas/air monitors; manual door dogs; hard lockout protocol

- Glass Rotunda (Garden Cover / Observation Ring)
  - Users: Observation staff; selected “visiting” researchers (cover)
  - Function: Concealed observation over inner ring; acoustic damping; false horticultural presentation
  - Control: Blind entries; view management with shutters; panic latch to inner stair sealed

- Water Plant / Suppression Compound
  - Users: Technical staff (cover + operative engineer); security pair on rotation
  - Function: Flow regulation, valve galleries, suppression compounding, tank/cistern service
  - Control: Locked banks and tag‑out rails; alarmed regulator cages; spill channels to catch basins

- Carriage House / Barracks
  - Users: Security squads; drivers; shift sergeant office
  - Function: Ready room, lockers, arms issue, transport staging
  - Flow: Direct egress to perimeter drives; sealed interior door except during drills/alerts

- Boathouse and Water Egress
  - Users: Water‑access team; security pair
  - Function: Discreet ingress/egress; small craft stow; flood‑gate control
  - Control: Tide/flow board; chain locks; signal shutters; emergency cache cupboard

- Field Storage Buildings and Irrigation Nodes
  - Users: Cover staff; perimeter security for sensor maintenance
  - Function: Agri‑storage front; concealed surveillance and comms relays
  - Control: Padlocked cages; disguised pull‑boxes; sensor mast maintenance ladders

- Underground Utility Spine and Crawlspaces
  - Users: Internal maintenance (vetted); response team during drills/alerts
  - Function: Cable trays, pipes, bleed valves, inspection hatches; alternate movement paths
  - Control: Hatch seals; low‑profile markers; periodic tamper checks

- High Observation Points (Roofline/Cupola/Lookouts)
  - Users: Observation specialist; relief post
  - Function: Perimeter scan, signal watch, weather/light discipline
  - Control: Shielded lamps; speaking tubes; code shutters

## Operating Roles (Mapped to Spaces)
- Checkpoint Lead (Gate House) → Threshold and manifest control; badge/band compliance
- Internal Response (Manor/Sub‑grade) → Corridor control, sally gate, observation gallery posts
- Waterworks Technician (Plant) → Valve/pressure oversight; regulator lockout/tagout
- Barracks Sergeant (Carriage House) → Ready lists, shift relief, arms issue, vehicle tasking
- Rotunda Observer (Observation Ring) → Visual logs, audio capture, signal discipline
- Water Access Team (Boathouse) → Craft prep, egress readiness, flood‑gate procedure
- Field Node Steward (Storage/Irrigation) → Sensor relay checks, concealment integrity
- Utility Spine Tech (Underground) → Inspection rounds; hatch seals; bleed valve logs

## Daily Rhythms & Access
- Morning: Gate intake; cover staff briefings; plant checks; observation ring comes online; controlled educational cover in public floors
- Midday: Maintenance windows (nodes/utilities); regulated movement in detention (meals/checks); supply dock scheduled
- Evening: Shift turnover; rotunda and roofline low‑lumen posture; corridor quiet hours
- Night: Bridge patrol cadence reduced; detention night routine; boathouse dark watch; utility spine quiet checks
- Shipment Windows (as scheduled): Gate lockdown; fixed route; doubled posts; records compartmented
- Alarm States:
  - Level 1 (Contain): Corridor pins; badge band freeze; observation shutters seal
  - Level 2 (Lockdown): Sally shut; sub‑grade isolation; boathouse and plant hard‑lock
  - Level 3 (Egress): Staged withdrawal via water egress and field nodes; burn/bleach protocol

## Access Rules (Physical Discipline)
- No unescorted movement beyond cover zones; badge + key + countersign at secure doors
- Cross‑contamination control: cover staff routes never intersect detention/service spurs
- Quiet‑corridor doctrine near observation/detention; signal plates in lieu of voice
- Clear lanes: gate to sally, plant regulator aisles, utility spine hatches, boathouse ramps

---
Canon Notes:
- Facility presents academic/agricultural cover while maintaining concealed sub‑grade detention and service infrastructure; physical separation of cover and secure flows is essential
- Observation via garden/rotunda ring and roofline; water plant governs suppression/regulator network; water egress exists but remains sealed under normal operations
- For chapter‑specific anchors and construction details, see description.md and history.md (first appearance and phased works recorded therein)
