  generation_notes: |
    A sprawling country estate that presents as a prestigious horticultural research center
    while concealing a black-site prison for magical captives. Every element of beauty—
    the glass rotunda, ornamental gardens, tranquil waterways—serves dual purposes of
    control, surveillance, and suppression. The visual key is "the gilded cage": beauty
    weaponized, nature perverted, institutions corrupted.

# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Essential Truth of This Place

narrative_soul: |
  Veridian Agronomics presents an impeccable facade—a prestigious research center
  cultivating rare orchids that require magical purity, justifying every security measure
  and containment system. The manor is stately, the conservatory spectacular, the gardens
  immaculate. Guests see cutting-edge environmental research. They don't see the sub-basement
  cells, the suppression compounds flowing through the water system, the kill zones disguised
  as ornamental gardens.

  This is Korrath and Cid's work weaponized—water systems they engineered for purity now
  deliver magical suppressants, architectural precision they created now channels prisoners
  into controlled corridors. When the reconnaissance team observes from the rocky outcrop,
  they see both the gilded surface and the iron beneath. When Rill's fingers touch the
  corrupted water, she feels the violation of everything natural. When Lyra infiltrates
  through deception, she turns the facility's human vulnerabilities back upon itself.

    The Silent Hand facility sprawls across a hidden valley, its buildings blending
    seamlessly with the natural landscape. From the observation outcrop, the estate
    reveals its scope—the three-storey stone manor commanding the grounds, the
    spectacular glass rotunda of the conservatory catching afternoon light, formal
    gardens descending toward a tranquil lake, twin streams converging at the heart
    of the property. Guard towers are disguised as observation posts. The dock

      A rocky outcrop on the valley rim provides the reconnaissance team's primary
      observation position. From here, the facility spreads below like a map—every

      The forest edge where the team observes gatehouse activity. Dense cover

      The Tudor-style gatehouse presents as an agricultural inspection station—
      vehicle barriers, manifest intake, badge issuance. Warm lamplight spills

      The stone-clad treatment plant presents as environmental purity research.
      A public tour corridor shows 'filtration exhibits.' Behind walls: suppression
      compounding facilities, storage cisterns, injection manifolds, and the master
      valve room that can isolate any section in 90 seconds. Korrath's precision
      engineering serves terrible purpose.

      The nerve center of the suppression system. Banks of color-coded valve
