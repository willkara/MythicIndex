# Silent Hand Facility (Veridian Agronomics) – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Hidden valley roughly 10 miles north of Waterdeep’s northern gate, on a 50-acre estate bounded by mixed forest to the north, a small lake to the west, and gently contoured cultivated fields to the south and east. Two perennial streams—one primary (E–W) and one secondary (N–S)—converge near the estate core before outflowing toward the lake. [FIRM: ch28–32 anchor the valley/forest/lake context]
- Site Advantages: Natural amphitheater provides visual screening; watercourses enable “research” pretext and true suppression distribution; long setbacks and controlled approaches enable layered perimeter security.
- Environmental Factors: Seasonal freeze–thaw cycles; spring flows are high and turbid; low, dawn ground-fog common near confluence and lakeshore; stormwater surges require detention and controlled spillways.
- Approach Routes:
  - North: Dense forest with game trails, hunter blinds (concealed posts). 
  - South: “Public” carriage road through landscaped grounds to a gatehouse “inspection” station.
  - East: Fields with irrigation ditches, field stores (surveillance outposts).
  - West: Lakeshore with boathouse/docks and steep, unstable slope segments. [FIRM: ch28–32; cover elements consistent with “research” facade]

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Country manor estate retrofitted for “environmental research”—stone manor core (Veridian Manor), glass rotunda conservatory, water treatment complex, carriage/barracks/security hub, boathouse and lakeside works, field storage outbuildings; all unified by an engineered water network. Exterior finishes present as prestigious, while structural cores conceal hardened functions.
- Primary Materials:
  - Masonry: Dressed stone walls with rubble core; brick-lined flues; reinforced concrete (concealed) in subgrade works and retaining walls.
  - Timber/Steel: Timber roof trusses; hidden steel lintels and frames where spans or loads required modernization.
  - Glazing/Metalwork: Conservatory glass with iron/copper framing; copper ridge/flashings; wrought-iron “specimen” fences and decorative screens masking sensors.
  - Piping/Controls: Stone culverts, terracotta and iron mains; concealed bronze and steel sluice hardware; arcane sensor housings in brass/copper.
- Overall Layout: Concentric deception—polished public ring (manor, gardens, conservatory) masking interior utility ring (treatment plant, carriage/security, service tunnels) enclosing subgrade prison complex tied into the lake and streams via a precise sluice and suppression network.

- Connections & Joints: Traditional mortise/tenon in legacy frames supplemented with iron straps; concealed steel angles/lintels at widened openings; flexible joints in water galleries.

### Environmental Controls
- Heating & Ventilation: Traditional flue warming at manor; mechanical assist at subgrade (fan rooms masked as “environmental chambers”); conservatory climate arrays; ducted makeup air at carriage/plant.
- Lighting Systems: Public areas use oil/gas and daylight; secure areas use shuttered, baffled fixtures; observation gallery has low-glare task lights; perimeter posts use shielded lamps.
- Water Management:
  - Supply/Distribution: Primary/secondary streams with intake screens; cisterns and compounding tanks; 23+ gated lines deliver suppression where required.
  - Drainage: Courtyard slot drains; lake spillways with energy dissipation; emergency dump valves to isolate contaminated lines; grease traps for kitchens (cover).
- Climate Protection: Storm shutters and window locks; snow-load spec on conservatory; wind baffles in exposed corridors; lightning protection bonded to metalwork and water ground.

### Security & Access
- Entry Control: South gatehouse as agricultural inspection station (vehicle barrier, pit, comms); badge/escort protocol; visitor flow channeled away from inner cores.

## Immersive Sensory Environment

### Visual Landscape
- Dominant Visual Elements: Stately manor stonework, glittering rotunda glass, tranquil watercourses, manicured gardens and “research beds,” with distant forest and lake backdrops.
- Material Textures: Cold, finely dressed stone; smooth slate; iron/copper accents; glass curvature; gravel underfoot; dark, damp subgrade concrete.
- Color Palette: Stone greys and warm coppers; glass greens; clipped hedges; deep water blues; clinical whites in staged labs; muted steel in secure nodes.
- Light & Shadow: Sun sparkles on rills; soft rotunda glow; long hallway shadows engineered to break sightlines; subgrade pools of light in otherwise oppressive dark.

### Acoustic Environment
- Sound Reflection: Manor halls reverberant but broken by tapestries and books; rotunda airy with soft drip/flow; subgrade hum of pumps and dampened footfalls.
- Noise Sources: Water whispers and sluice ticks; wind in the hedges; distant forest rustle; muted clanks and relay clicks in galleries; occasional bell at the gate.
- Acoustic Zones: Public tone is civilized hush; exterior agricultural clatter staged; below, a controlled mechanical thrum and the low hiss of moving water.

### Environmental Atmosphere
- Air Quality: Fresh, resinous on the forest edge; moist and mineral near the streams; faint chlorination and reagent traces near treatment halls; metallic tang subgrade.
- Scent Profiles: Wet stone; cut greenery; oil and lamp smoke; copper/ozone at lightning grounds; sterilants near “medical” spaces; lake’s humic note.
- Physical Comfort: Pleasant overground microclimate in public rings; cool, dry and slightly pressurized in secure corridors; stable temperatures in cell blocks.

## Temporal & Seasonal Variations

### Daily Environmental Changes
- Morning: Fog drapes the confluence; conservatory vents warm; gatehouse opens with staged “deliveries”; subgrade fan rooms spool up.
- Midday: High daylight in rotunda; tours (select days) move through public corridors; field nodes manned for “irrigation cycles.”
- Evening: Glass glows as interior lamps rise; blinds rotate watches; command center increases perimeter scans.
- Night: Low-signature perimeter lighting; reduced above-grade traffic; subgrade routines maintain constant environmental control.

### Seasonal Adaptations
- Spring: High flows; silt prefilters checked; culverts scoured; field ditches cleared; fog frequent at dawn. [FIRM: timeline]
- Summer: Shading extended at rotunda; ventilation moderates heat; lake intake screens cleaned often.
- Autumn: Leaf load monitored; storm drains cleared; suppression dosing curves adjusted for temperature.
- Winter: Freeze protocols (heat tracing on lines; snow-load inspections); shuttered exposure; tunnel humidity control.

### Weather Response Patterns
- Fair Weather: Public-facing charm heightened; water features placid; observation casual.
- Storms: Sectional floodgates staged; emergency pump checks; mobile barriers positioned; tours canceled.
- Extreme Weather: Full lockdown of rotunda glazing vents; lower lake spillway engaged; egress tunnel evaluated; backup power online.
