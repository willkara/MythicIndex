  narrative_soul: |
    The Silent Hand Facility is corruption perfected—a literal gilded cage where every beautiful element conceals a mechanism of imprisonment. The streams that sparkle through manicured gardens carry suppression compounds. The glass conservatory designed to nurture rare orchids actually suppresses and observes captive mages. The prestigious country manor sits atop cell blocks where people disappear. This is the story of how evil doesn't announce itself—it hides behind tax records, polished stone, and the language of legitimate enterprise.

  transformation_arc: |
    The facility maintains its pristine facade until the Last Light Company's operation. Its transformation in the story isn't physical but revelatory—the peeling back of layers to expose what lies beneath. For the characters, the arc moves from distant intelligence (knowing it exists) to intimate confrontation (navigating its corridors). The location's power lies in how long it can maintain its lie, and how thorough that lie is.

  visual_signature: |
    The facility presents a stark visual duality. Above ground: a stately 3-story stone manor with warm copper accents, a magnificent 100-foot glass rotunda conservatory glinting in daylight, manicured gardens threaded with sparkling water rills, all set against a backdrop of forest and lake. Below: clinical gray concrete corridors, pressure-rated doors with numbered markings, pools of harsh light in oppressive darkness, the constant hum of suppression systems.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Above: civilized hush—water whispers in rills, wind in hedges, distant forest rustle, the occasional bell at the gate. Below: a controlled mechanical thrum, the low hiss of moving water in pipes, relay clicks in galleries, footsteps dampened and echoing simultaneously.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Above: fresh resinous air from the forest, wet stone, cut greenery, pleasant mineral notes from the streams. Below: faint chlorination and reagent traces, metallic tang, sterilants, the absence of natural scent.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Above: gravel crunching underfoot, smooth polished stone, warm copper fixtures, cool glass. Below: cold damp concrete, the vibration of pumps through walls, the slightly pressurized air of sealed corridors, clammy chill.

  light_character: |
    The facility weaponizes light. Above ground: generous daylight through tall manor windows, the ethereal glow of the glass conservatory creating cathedral-like light shafts, copper fixtures casting warm lamplight in public spaces. Below: harsh functional lighting in corridors, deliberate pools of illumination separated by stretches of shadow, observation rooms lit to see into but not out of, the subgrade existence designed to disorient through controlled light deprivation.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Weather transforms the facility's character dramatically. Dawn fog frequently drapes the stream confluence and lakeshore, giving the estate an ethereal, dreamlike quality that enhances its deceptive beauty. Storms trigger visible security responses—shuttered vents, canceled tours, doubled posts—moments when the mask slips slightly. Clear days maximize the contrast between the sparkling above-ground presentation and what lies beneath.

      A stunning 100-foot diameter glass rotunda rising 40 feet to its apex, supported by iron and copper framing on a stone curb. The interior presents staged garden beds and "research areas" that disguise their true purpose—observation zones for prisoners given "exercise" in the garden sectors. A central suppression fountain and monitor plinth serves as both decorative feature and control node. An upper observation gallery provides 360-degree sightlines while serving as a guard catwalk. Climate control systems mask their secondary function as environmental control for prisoners. Garden-bed hatches concealed among the plantings provide access to cell blocks below.
