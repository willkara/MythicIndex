narrative_soul: |
  The Windborne Roost is where legitimate commerce and clandestine operations
  share the same roof without ever acknowledging each other. This hilltop inn
  at the crossroads serves travelers with hot food and dry beds, serves farmers
  with seed and tools, and serves the City Watch with intelligence and staging
  grounds—all under the watchful eyes of Quierk, the aarakocra proprietor who
  sees everything from his observation cupola and says nothing he shouldn't.
  The compound sprawls with the honest prosperity of a successful waystation:
  timber longhouse with twin hearths, busy stables, market arcade with fold-down
  awnings, guest wing under dormers. But two rooms have bell-pulls to the perch.
  Two market bays have rear hatches to the tavern. And the stream that waters
  the stock carries secrets in its current—including, one terrible day, the
  magical taint of the Silent Hand's trafficking. For the reconnaissance team,
  the Roost transforms from waystation to sanctuary, a place where weary faces
  find warm fires and the return from danger feels like homecoming.

one_line_essence: "A hilltop waystation where legitimate business covers clandestine operations and sharp aarakocra eyes miss nothing."
