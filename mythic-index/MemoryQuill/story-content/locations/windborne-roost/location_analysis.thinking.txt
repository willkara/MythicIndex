This is a detailed location analysis request for "The Windborne Roost" - a roadside inn/tavern with City Watch connections. I need to analyze this location through the five dimensions of place framework and produce a comprehensive YAML analysis.

Let me work through the analysis systematically:

## Step 1: Physical Truth

From the description.md:
- Heavy timber-framed longhouse tavern on fieldstone plinths
- Twin chimney stacks, cedar-shingle roofs with snow guards
- Central cobbled courtyard with crowned drains
- Guest wing (1.5 storeys), stables, market arcade
- Strategic hilltop position at crossroads
- Observation perch/cupola above tavern gable
- Near the Thornwood edge
- Northern seasonal climate

Key sensory elements:
- Visual: Warm shingle roofs, timber frames, busy courtyard
- Sound: Hearth crackle, hoof clatter, bell peals, forest rustle
- Scent: Roast/bread, oak/pine, saddle soap, stream at dawn
- Tactile: Hearth warmth, crisp northern air

Canon specifics that MUST appear:
- Twin chimney stacks
- Aarakocra proprietor (Quierk)
- Observation perch with road views
- Market arcade with agricultural goods
- Edge of Thornwood visible
- Commanding hilltop position
- Cobbled courtyard with lamp posts

## Step 2: Narrative Soul

This is a place of:
- Transition - between city and wilderness, safety and danger
- Dual nature - legitimate inn AND covert operations hub
- Sanctuary before/after danger
- Bridge between official authority and field work

Thematic tensions:
- Public bustling inn vs. covert Watch operations
- Civilian warmth vs. military precision
- Ordinary waystation vs. intelligence hub

Story role:
- Strategic waypoint for northern operations
- Safe house for the Company


- Intelligence gathering hub
- "Last normal stop" before danger

## Step 3: Character-Space Relationships

Quierk's strategic positioning defines the inn's essence. His observation perch serves as both a physical and metaphorical vantage point, transforming the Roost into a living surveillance system. The space becomes an extension of his keen avian perception, where every corner reflects watchfulness and strategic insight.

For the Company, the inn is a multifunctional operational base. The courtyard functions as a critical transition zone for arrivals and departures, while the common room provides a facade of normalcy concealing intense reconnaissance activities. Private guest rooms become clandestine briefing chambers, blending hospitality with covert purpose.

## Step 4: Temporal States

The inn pulses with a rhythmic daily cycle of strategic preparation and subtle movement. Pre-dawn hours buzz with quiet activity - kitchen fires spark to life, stables undergo meticulous preparation, and covert departures are carefully orchestrated.

As daylight progresses, the space transforms. Morning brings increasing activity, midday sees the courtyard at its most vibrant, evening settles with warm hearth glow, and night descends into strategic quietude punctuated by Quierk's intermittent vigilance.

Seasonal shifts further nuance the inn's character. From spring's muddy transitions to winter's storm-ready protocols, the space adapts continuously, always maintaining its core function as a critical waypoint.

The story's timeline tracks the inn's evolving significance - from initial introduction as a busy waystation to a sanctuary of strategic regrouping, each chapter revealing deeper layers of its operational complexity.

## Step 5: Contextualize in World

Strategically positioned at the North Road crossroads, perched on a hilltop near the Thornwood's edge, the inn commands approaches between Waterdeep and northern settlements. A nearby stream ensures practical sustainability, while its geographic placement makes it an ideal transitional space between civilization and wilderness.

## Zone Classification

The inn's spatial design reveals its true nature: an observation perch symbolizing its heart, a carriage gate marking critical thresholds, each area meticulously designed for strategic interaction and controlled movement.

From guest sanctuary to market arcade, every zone serves a precise function - blending legitimate commerce with covert operational readiness, transforming seamlessly between rest and rapid deployment.
