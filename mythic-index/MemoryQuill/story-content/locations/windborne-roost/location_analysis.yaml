  narrative_soul: |
    The Windborne Roost is the last ordinary place before the wilderness begins—a 
    bustling crossroads inn that hides a sharp-eyed sentinel function beneath its 
    homely commerce. It represents the moment when official authority hands you off 
    to your own judgment, where the warmth of hearth and hay gives way to whatever 
    waits in the Thornwood. For those who know how to ask, it's a bridge between 
    the city's intelligence apparatus and the dangerous unknown beyond.
    
  one_line_essence: "Watchful waystation where safety yields to the wild road"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "The threshold between civilization and frontier"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Dual nature—public facade over covert purpose"

      - "ordinary travelers vs. those on secret business"

      - "staying put vs. the road ahead"

  transformation_arc: |
    For the Company, the Roost transforms from "unfamiliar waystation" to "reliable 
    sanctuary." On first arrival it's just a sprawling inn at the edge of wild 
    country. By the return in ch31-32, it carries the weight of safety regained—
    the place you reach when the hard part is over. The building doesn't change, 
    but its emotional meaning shifts from "last stop before danger" to "first sign 
    of safety after."

  scale_impression: "Sprawling but grounded—the compound spreads across the hilltop with practical confidence, neither grand nor humble, simply built to endure northern seasons and serve travelers well"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Twin chimney stacks rising from the longhouse tavern dominate the silhouette 
    from the road below. The observation cupola perched above the gable adds an 
    unexpected vertical accent—part widow's walk, part watchtower. Cedar shingles 
    have weathered to silver-grey on windward faces while staying warm brown in 
    sheltered spots. The low fieldstone wall traces the compound's edge like a 
    stone collar around the hilltop.
    
  sound_signature: |
    A layered hum of activity—hearth crackle and kitchen clatter from the tavern; 
    hoof-strike and harness jingle from the yard; the splash of the water trough 
    pump; bell peals marking arrivals and hours. Beneath it all, the wind—always 
    the wind across the hilltop, carrying forest sounds from the nearby Thornwood.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Roasting meat and fresh bread from the kitchen, underlaid with woodsmoke and 
    lamp oil. Pine resin from the nearby stand. In the stables, clean straw, 
    saddle soap, and the honest musk of horses. At dawn, cold stream-dampness 
    rising from the valley below.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Cobblestones worn smooth underfoot in the courtyard. The sudden embrace of 
    hearth-warmth when passing through the tavern door. Rough fieldstone cool 
    under fingertips. The ever-present edge of northern wind, even in sheltered 
    corners—this is not a soft southern place.

  light_character: |
    Northern light through large common room windows—clear and somewhat cool even 
    on bright days. The twin hearths provide the dominant interior illumination, 
    casting warm pools that fight the grey daylight. Lanterns on bracket arms 
    under the tie-beams create constellations of smaller light. The cupola perch 
    catches first and last light of day, exposed to the open sky. At night, lamp 
    posts at the gates and along the arcade create islands of glow in the yard's 
    darkness.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Northern weather defines this place—snow guards on every roof, storm shutters 
    on every window, mud boards stacked by thresholds for spring. The hilltop 
    position means constant wind, funneled along the road corridor. Morning ground 
    fog from the nearby stream can fill the valley while the Roost sits clear 
    above. In winter, the compound becomes a warm island in white landscape.

contextual_place:
  region: "North Road, between Waterdeep and northern settlements, at the edge of the Thornwood"
  
  neighborhood_character: |
    Wild country beginning to assert itself. The crossroads marks where the 
    settled road network meets frontier territory. Pine stands and mixed hardwoods 
    crowd the approaches. Other travelers are more scarce here than closer to 
    the city—those who come this far have purpose. The Thornwood's edge is 
    visible as a darker line of trees, simultaneously shelter and warning.
  
  approach_sequences:
    - name: "From the South (Waterdeep direction)"
      description: |
        The road climbs gradually through rolling country, the Thornwood growing 
        closer on the right. The Roost appears first as a silhouette on the rise 
        ahead—twin chimneys, the cupola's angular peak, the low spread of buildings. 
        The graded stone-lined drive climbs from the crossroads to the carriage gate.
      first_impression: "Relief—a substantial waystation after miles of empty road. The twin chimneys promise warmth, the hilltop position suggests security."
      
    - name: "From the North (returning from mission)"
      description: |
        Coming down from wilder country, through or past the Thornwood. The Roost 
        is a beacon of civilization—lamp glow visible from distance at night, 
        chimney smoke by day. The descent to the crossroads and then the climb 
        to the compound gates marks the transition back to safety.
      first_impression: "Sanctuary. The hard part is over. Whatever happened in the Thornwood, this is where you can finally rest."

      what_visible: "Open farmland and pasture in the middle distance"
      
  spatial_relationship: |
    The Roost commands its hilltop like a keep without walls—the elevation itself 
    provides the defensive advantage. The crossroads below is clearly visible, 
    allowing observation of traffic from all directions. The Thornwood begins 
    close enough to cast morning shadow on the compound's eastern edge, close 
    enough that the forest feels present even within the courtyard. The stream 
    in the valley below is hidden from view but its presence is felt in dawn fog 
    and the faint sound of water on quiet nights.

      description: |
        The Roost as new waystation—busy, sprawling, efficiently run by 
        the aarakocra proprietor. Emphasis on legitimate bustle and the 
        scale of the operation. The Company learning its layout.
        
    - state_name: "Operational Staging (ch30)"
      chapter_range: "ch30"
      description: |
        Pre-dawn covert preparations. The Roost's dual nature most visible— 
        agricultural cover concealing mission logistics. Tense, professional, 
        purposeful in the grey light.

      chapter_range: "ch31-ch32"
      description: |
        Return at dawn after whatever happened in the Thornwood. The Roost 
        now carries emotional weight—first safety, earned rest, the hard 
        part over. Same buildings, transformed meaning.

  weather_states:
    - condition: "clear"
      description: |
        The Roost at its most commanding—hilltop position visible for 
        miles, sight lines from perch excellent, the Thornwood clearly 
        defined on the horizon.

    - condition: "rain"
      description: |
        Courtyard cobbles slick, drains working, travelers hurrying 
        between buildings. The covered arcade more valuable. Sound of 
        rain on cedar shingles.
      mood: "cozy sheltered contrast, the value of roof and wall"
      
    - condition: "fog"
      description: |
        Dawn fog rising from the valley, obscuring the approaches. The 
        perch above the fog line, watching road sections emerge and 
        disappear. Eerie, reduced visibility.
      mood: "mysterious, watchful, the world contracted to immediate surroundings"
      
    - condition: "snow"
      description: |
        White blanket transforming the compound. Snow guards deflecting 
        accumulation, chimney smoke stark against grey sky. The approach 
        road marked by tracks in white.
      mood: "fortress isolation, precious warmth, the landscape simplified to essential shapes"
      
    - condition: "storm"
      description: |
        Shutters drawn and latched, drains running full, animals secured 
        in stable. The common room becomes the only world. Wind audible 
        through the frame.
      mood: "hunkered, intimate, the outside world held at bay"
