# The Windborne Roost – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Hilltop waystation at a strategic crossroads along the North Road, set on a low rise with gentle slopes and firm subgrade. Edge of the Thornwood, with mixed coniferous and hardwood stands providing windbreaks. Clear sight lines along the approaching roads in all directions. [FIRM: ch28, ch30; return in ch31–32]
- Site Advantages: Elevated position for early warning and traffic observation; natural drainage away from yard center; stands of pine for local timber and shelter; stream within short walk for stock watering and cleaning. 
- Environmental Factors: Northern seasonal variability with snow and freeze-thaw cycles; prevailing winds funneled along road corridor; spring mud and wagon ruts; occasional low ground fog at dawn from nearby stream.
- Approach Routes: Two principal roads meeting at the crossroads below the rise; a graded, stone-lined drive climbs to the courtyard gate; secondary service track around leeward side to woodpile and refuse pit.

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Rural northern inn complex—heavy timber-framed longhouse tavern with fieldstone plinths and multiple masonry chimney stacks; outbuildings (guest wing, stables, market shed) in matching frame and shingle. Defensive posture via elevation, yard enclosure, and disciplined sight lines rather than overt fortification. [FIRM: ch28 “sprawling inn and trading post,” chimneys, stables, market bustle]
- Primary Materials:
  - Masonry: Fieldstone foundations and plinths; brick-lined hearths and oven; lime mortar.
  - Timber: Oak sills and posts; pine/cedar studs and rafters; pegged mortise-and-tenon joinery.
  - Roofing: Cedar shingles with snow guards; lead flashing at valleys; copper caps on chimney pots.
  - Surfaces: Limewash on interior plaster in guest wing; oiled board-and-batten elsewhere.
- Overall Layout: Cluster of buildings arranged around a cobbled courtyard—Main Tavern (southwest), Guest Quarters Wing (northeast), Stables and Coach Yard (west), Market Stalls Arcade (southeast) with service yard beyond. Low stone boundary wall defines the compound; gated carriage entrance on the downslope side; foot gate by market shed. [FIRM: courtyard, stables, market, guest wing]

- Light & Shadow: Hearth glow through mullions; dormer light pooling on yard cobbles; lantern halos along the arcade.

### Acoustic Environment
- Sound Reflection: Common room hum softened by beams and banners; yard bright with hoof and wheel clatter; stables cushioned by straw.
- Noise Sources: Hearth crackle, skillet hiss, harness creak, trough splash, bell peals; distant forest rustle.
- Acoustic Zones: Private booths at tavern perimeter; quiet in guest upper hall; loft muffled but with roof patter.

### Environmental Atmosphere
- Air Quality: Clean resinous pine from nearby wood; hearth smoke drawn well; stable scents tidy and limed.
- Scent Profiles: Roast and bread, oak and pine, saddle soap and oiled leather, cold stream and damp earth at dawn.
- Physical Comfort: Hearth warmth in tavern; windbreak by low wall; dry cobbles under covered arcade in weather.

## Temporal & Seasonal Variations

### Daily Environmental Changes

Canon Notes:
- [FIRM] ch28 — “Sprawling inn and trading post” at the edge of the Thornwood; busy stables and market; numerous chimneys; travelers’ bustle.
- [FIRM] ch27 — Legitimate establishment used as discreet Watch waystation; proprietor Quierk (aarakocra) with superior road vantage.
- [FIRM] ch30 — Pre-dawn preparations in courtyard under cover of agricultural work; concealed logistics.
- [FIRM] ch31–32 — Return to the Roost at dawn; sanctuary-like feel after operation.
- [IMPLIED]/[FLEXIBLE] — Specific drainage, reed bed, reed/sanitation, structural tie-downs, and cupola/perch details align with northern rural construction and do not contradict chapters.
