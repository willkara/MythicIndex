creatures:
  - name: Wind Messenger
    description: Small aerial elementals that carry messages and news on the breeze. They're drawn to the Roost because of Quierk's aarakocra nature and the constant flow of information. They whisper news and rumors to those who know how to listen to the wind.
    visual_aspects:
      - Nearly invisible ripples in the air, like heat shimmer
      - Occasionally visible as small whirlwinds carrying leaves or snow
      - Sound like distant whistling or whispering voices
      - Create spiraling patterns in campfire smoke
      - During rain, appear as spiraling gaps in falling water
    habitat:
      where: Around the clearing, especially near gathering areas and travelers' camps
      when: Most active during weather changes and when travelers arrive
      why: Feed on the exchange of information and stories; drawn to news
    behavior:
      who: Dozens of individual messengers passing through constantly
      what: Carry fragments of conversations, news, and rumors across distances
      how: Absorb words from one location and release them as whispers elsewhere
    lore: Quierk understands them perfectly and gets early warning of troubles from their whispers. He's taught a few regulars to listen: "When the wind speaks of smoke, check the forest. When it speaks of steel, watch the road. When it speaks your name, someone is coming for you."

  - name: Perch Drake
    description: Small dragon-kin that nest in the Roost's structure and surrounding trees. They're protective of the establishment and its regular guests, dive-bombing threats and stealing from those Quierk marks as unwelcome. They hoard shiny trinkets in the rafters.
    visual_aspects:
      - Lizard-like bodies about the size of housecats with bat-like wings
      - Scales in forest colors: greens, browns, occasional iridescent blue
      - Surprisingly expressive faces with intelligent eyes
      - Can puff up their throat sacs to appear larger when threatened
      - Wingspan of 3-4 feet, agile fliers through dense trees
    habitat:
      where: Roost rafters, surrounding tree canopy, and cliff faces
      when: Diurnal; most active during meal times when scraps are available
      why: Symbiotic relationship with the Roost; protection for food and shelter
    behavior:
      who: Colony of 8-12 individuals led by a breeding pair
      what: Guard territory, harass threats, steal from undesirables
      how: Coordinate aerial attacks; communicate with chirps and wing signals
    lore: Quierk claims he never trained them—they just understand who belongs and who doesn't. Regulars feed them scraps and are never bothered. Those marked as trouble find belongings mysteriously vanishing and reappearing in the rafters, just out of reach. The colony once drove off a group of bandits by repeatedly stealing their weapons.

  - name: Trail Hare
    description: Supernaturally fast rabbits that bound along forest trails, always traveling. Locals believe they mark safe paths—where Trail Hares run freely, the way is clear. Where they refuse to go, danger waits. They seem to know things before they happen.
    visual_aspects:
      - Slightly larger than normal rabbits with longer legs built for speed
      - Fur patterns in browns and grays that blend with forest trails
      - Eyes unusually bright and alert, constantly scanning surroundings
      - Move with distinctive bounding gait, never walking slowly
      - Leave distinctive four-point tracks that seem to glow faintly at dusk
    habitat:
      where: Forest trails throughout the Thornwood, regularly visiting the Roost clearing
      when: Most visible dawn and dusk; seen in daylight only when conditions are safe
      why: Unknown; possibly fey-touched or minor spirits of safe passage
    behavior:
      who: Individuals or small groups of 2-3
      what: Run specific routes daily; behavior changes predict danger
      how: Avoid areas that will become dangerous before threats manifest
    lore: Rangers watch Trail Hare behavior religiously. If they're bouncing across the northern trail without care, it's safe. If they refuse to enter an area or run frantically past without stopping, something's wrong. The morning before a Silent Hand patrol passed, every Trail Hare in the region fled south. Quierk cleared his guests out three hours before the patrol arrived.

  - name: Story Moth
    description: Large nocturnal moths attracted to fire and conversation. Their wing patterns rearrange to show images related to nearby stories. They're considered blessed by travelers, as they seem to appear when important news is being shared, creating visual accompaniment.
    visual_aspects:
      - Wingspan of 6-8 inches with pale, translucent wings
      - Wing patterns shift and flow like living paintings
      - Attracted to firelight, circling flames in slow spirals
      - Patterns show scenes, faces, and symbols related to nearby conversations
      - Produce faint iridescent dust that glitters in firelight
    habitat:
      where: Around the Roost's fire pits and gathering areas
      when: Nocturnal; drawn to flames and storytelling
      why: Feed on emotions and narrative energy; pollinate night-blooming plants
    behavior:
      who: Solitary or in small groups during good storytelling
      what: Display shifting images on wings; enhance and reflect stories being told
      how: Absorb narrative and emotional energy; manifest it as visual patterns
    lore: When Veyra's team shared their Silent Hand reconnaissance, a dozen Story Moths appeared, their wings showing imprisoned faces and dark waters. Old travelers claim the moths remember stories and carry them to other fires, spreading news across the realm in images that transcend language.
