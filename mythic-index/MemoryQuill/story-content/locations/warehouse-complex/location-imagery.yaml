  narrative_soul: |
    The Dock Ward Warehouse Complex is where the Last Light Company became a family. Behind its iron-banded gates, what was once an industrial compound has been transformed into something both fortress and home—a place where warriors brief for battle around a round table, break bread together in a working mess, and heal in quiet rooms where herbs hang from the ceiling. It embodies the Company's nature: disciplined, competent, and surprisingly warm.

  visual_description: |
    The arched stone gatehouse rises from the 15-foot perimeter wall, its round-arched voussoirs 
    framing iron-banded oak double doors—massive timber leaves reinforced with heavy iron straps 
    and internal slide-bolts. Lamp niches flank the arch, their bronze brackets dark in early 
    light. The deep stone reveal shadows the wicket door set into the right leaf. Within the 
    alcove, the duty board hangs beside the muster bell rope. The perimeter wall extends to 
    either side, its coped parapet shedding the last of night's dew, pilaster buttresses 
    marching away at regular intervals. Through the partially open gate, the crowned cobbles 
    of the yard catch first light, the three warehouse buildings visible as dark masses 
    beyond. A figure in the gate alcove checks the roster—the day's first duty. The harbor 
    district stirs beyond: a cart wheel on distant cobbles, gulls crying, the smell of salt 
    and tar carried on morning air. This is the face the Company shows the world: controlled, 
    watchful, ready.
    
  composition_notes: |
    Medium-wide framing with the gatehouse as central subject. Shooting angle slightly 
    below eye level to emphasize the gateway's imposing height. The wall extends beyond 
    frame edges to suggest continuous enclosure. Through the open gate, enough of the 
    yard visible to promise the world within. A single figure for scale and life. Early 
    morning light from the right creates depth through shadow in the arch's reveal.
    
  narrative_significance: |
    Every arrival and departure passes through this gate. This is where missions begin, 
    where homecomings happen, where the boundary between the Company's family and the 
    outside world is maintained. The gatehouse doesn't just control access—it creates 
    the threshold that makes the compound meaningful.
    
  symbolic_elements: |
    The arch as controlled portal—suggesting both welcome and exclusion. The lamp niches 
    flanking like guardian eyes. The duty board visible within: this is a place of order, 
    of documented responsibility. The darkness within the reveal versus the light beyond 
    creates tension between interior refuge and exterior world.

    scene_mood: "somber"
    mood_rationale: "This is where the weight of command settles—decisions that cost lives are made at this table. The egalitarian geometry of the round, the bands of light marking passing time, the height of space above pressing down. Solemn, purposeful, sacred."
    
    visual_description: |
      The nave-like interior of Building A rises to its 28-32 foot ridge, queen-post timber 
      trusses with iron ties spanning overhead. High clerestory lancets pierce the upper walls,
      their iron bars casting grid shadows as morning light streams through. The light strikes
      the space in dramatic diagonal bands, tracking slowly across the timber plank floor
      toward the round map table at the center.
      
      The table itself commands the space—oak, worn smooth from use, maps and documents
      spread across its surface. No head, no hierarchy of position. Around the table's
      perimeter, simple chairs wait. Brazier points with guards stand ready at the edges
      of the briefing circle, cold now in daylight. The mezzanine walkway rings the 
      perimeter above, timber-framed quarters and offices glimpsed in shadow, oak beams 
      socketed into pilaster buttresses.
      
      This is the heart—where the Company gathers as equals, where light bands count
      the hours, where decisions become destiny.
      
    composition_notes: |
      Medium shot from a three-quarter angle, slightly elevated to capture both the
      round table's geometry and the dramatic height above. The clerestory light bands
      should be the primary visual element, striking across the table surface. Include
      enough of the trusses overhead to establish the nave-like volume. The mezzanine
      should be visible but secondary. The round table centered, maps visible on surface.
      
    narrative_significance: |
      The round table is the Company's identity made physical: no head, all present,
      decisions made together. The clerestory light tracking across it marks passing
      time—meetings end, light shifts, but the circle remains constant. This is where
      Veyra leads by inclusion, where Marcus presents intelligence, where the Company
      plans together and shares fate together.
      
    symbolic_elements: |
      The round table: egalitarian leadership, Arthurian resonance, shared fate.
      The moving light bands: time's passage, the hours counting down to action.
      The height above: the weight of purpose pressing down, the space for thought.
      The mezzanine looking down: leadership never fully separate, always watching.

    scene_mood: "kinetic"
    mood_rationale: "The forge is creation through fire and force—the rhythm of hammer, the hiss of quench, the dance of sparks. This is skilled labor in motion, transformation happening in real time."
    
    visual_description: |
      The central masonry forge dominates Building B, its broad hood rising to the lined
      flue, the hearth glowing fierce orange at working heat. Multi-branch ventilation
      ducting climbs from the hood to roof cowls that provide passive draft assist—
      Cid's engineering made real in iron and stone. The cowl geometry catches wind,
      drawing smoke and heat upward, the space breathable despite the fire.
      
      The forge light casts everything in warm orange and deep shadow. The quench tank
      sits on its stone pad, water ready for the hiss of hot metal. Tool silhouettes
      are painted on racks along the perimeter walls—the discipline of everything in
      its place. The traveling chain hoist runs along the ridge above, jib rail positions
      ready for heavy work. An anvil stands on its isolated stone block foundation,
      hammer resting against its flank.
      
      This is where things are made and unmade. The forge represents the Company's
      self-sufficiency—they can make what they need, repair what breaks, forge what
      must be forged.
      
    composition_notes: |
      Medium shot centered on the forge hearth, looking slightly up to capture the hood
      and ventilation ducting rising to the cowls. The orange glow of the hearth should
      be the primary light source, creating dramatic illumination and deep shadows.
      Include the quench tank, anvil, and enough of the tool racks to establish the
      working space. The chain hoist visible overhead. Dynamic composition suggesting
      the energy of the space even without a figure present.
      
    narrative_significance: |
      Grimjaw's domain represents the Company's capability to sustain itself. The
      ventilation project (ch29) shows commitment—this isn't just borrowed space but
      a place worth investing in. The forge is creation, transformation, the making
      of tools for survival.
      
    symbolic_elements: |
      Fire as transformation. The ventilation system as collaboration between crafts
      (Grimjaw's smithing, Cid's engineering). The anvil as steadfastness. The tool

    visual_description: |
      A circular room at the heart of Building C's infirmary wing, defined by its 
      medicinal abundance. Herbs hang from the ceiling in bundles—dried lavender, 
      mint, chamomile, valerian—creating a vertical garden of greens and browns and 
      purples. More herbs line the curved walls on shelves and in hanging sachets.
      
      A low hearth provides gentle warmth without harsh heat, an incense flue carrying
      soft aromatic smoke upward. The light is diffused—clerestory glazing filters
      daylight to an even pearl glow, nothing harsh, nothing glaring. Two simple chairs
      face each other in the center, waiting for conversations that matter.
      
      The scent is medicinal green: camphor and mint and dried flowers, the smell of
      growing things and gentle warmth. This is where Aldwin provides counsel, where
      the wounded heal in ways that medicine alone cannot touch. The circular shape
      has no corners for darkness to hide in, no hierarchy of position. Here, 
      warriors can be vulnerable.
      
    composition_notes: |
      Medium interior shot emphasizing the circular enclosure and vertical dimension
      of hanging herbs. The two chairs should be visible but not dominant—this is
      about the space itself, its character. Soft, even lighting throughout. The
      warmth of the low hearth should be felt but not seen as a strong light source.
      Composition should feel embracing, enclosed, safe.
      
    narrative_significance: |
      Aldwin's sanctuary represents the Company's care for the whole person, not just
      the soldier. Here, the hurts that don't bleed find treatment. The circular space,
      outside the military routine's sharp edges, offers something rare: permission
      to be wounded in ways that matter.

      The circle: no hierarchy, no corners, wholeness. The hanging herbs: life

      only gentle illumination.

    visual_description: |
      The covered cartway at night during steady rain. Lean-to slate roofs shed water
      into the darkness beyond their edges; the rain is visible as silver streaks at
      the boundary of shelter. Post-and-beam structure at 9-10 foot intervals creates
      a rhythm of uprights, the slate roofing dark overhead.
      
      Lantern brackets at every bay hold lit lanterns, their amber flames creating pools
      of warm light on the granite cobbles. The cobbles are wet—crowned to drain, their
      surfaces glossy black where the rain has touched them, reflecting the lantern
      light in broken amber pools. The trench drains are audible, water rushing to
      the silt boxes.
      
      Beyond the shelter's edge, the yard is dark and wet, rain falling steadily. But
      here, under the cartway's protection, work could continue. Rope pegs and coil
      posts are visible, crate zones marked on the paving. The compound goes on despite
      the weather, warm circles of light carved from the darkness.
      
    mood_shift_from_base: |
      During day, the cartway is transitional space—useful but unremarkable. At night 
      in rain, it transforms into something beautiful and intimate. The contrast between
      warm shelter and cold rain, between amber pools and black wet stone, creates an

      The compound in the grey before dawn. Buildings A, B, and C are dark masses

      fading.
      
      Veyra moves through the compound with a single lamp—a lantern in her hand,
      its amber glow the only warm light in the scene. She is lighting other lanterns
      in sequence, marking the compound's waking. One lamp bracket already glows
      behind her; she approaches the next. Her silhouette is recognizable—the
      commander's posture, the deliberate movement.
      
      This is ch32's pre-dawn staging: bell discipline, lamp routes, stretcher
      clearances. The ritual that says: today we go into danger, but first we
      light the way. The compound emerging from darkness one lamp at a time.

    visual_description: |
      The central cobbled yard from an elevated angle—perhaps from Building A's former
      loading doors or an upper window. The ~120 × 100 foot space opens beneath full
      sky, its crowned granite cobbles catching midday light. The trench drains are
      visible as dark lines, iron grates at intervals.
      
      Three building faces define the yard's edges: Building A with its high clerestory
      lancets, Building B with its ventilator ridge and roof cowls, Building C's quieter
      volume. The covered cartway's lean-to roofs run along the windward walls, creating
      shaded circulation. Against one wall, the archery target backstops stand ready.
      Dog kennels shelter against another.
      
      Small figures move through the space—someone crossing to the cartway, another
      at the standpipe, a small group near the training area. The 15-foot perimeter
      wall encloses it all, the coped parapet visible where it meets sky.
      
      This is the compound's common ground—not domestic like the mess, not solemn
      like the briefing circle, but the practical center where paths cross.
      
    composition_notes: |
      High oblique angle showing the yard's geometry and the three buildings' 
      relationship. Wide enough to include portions of all three buildings and
      the cartway. The perimeter wall should frame the scene. Small figures for
      scale and life, but not the focus. Midday light creating minimal shadow,
      full exposure.
      
    narrative_significance: |
      The yard is where the compound's life happens in daylight—drills, deliveries,
      transit, work. It's the space that connects the specialized zones. The image
      shows the compound as organized system, self-sufficient world within walls.
      
    symbolic_elements: |
      The three buildings as three functions (command, craft, care). The enclosing
      wall creating the separate world. The crowned cobbles shedding rain, managing
      weather, the discipline of infrastructure.

    perspective_description: |
      From Veyra's quarters on the mezzanine, looking down at the briefing circle
      below. This is how she sees the heart of the compound—from above, connected
      but separate, able to observe without descending. The round table is visible
      below, the empty chairs, the maps waiting. Leadership's vantage: always watching,
      never truly off duty.
      
    character_signature_element: "a lantern on the mezzanine rail, Veyra's ever-present light"
    
    scene_mood: "intimate"
    mood_rationale: "The private vantage of command—connection without intrusion, the weight of watching over those in your care. Intimate in the sense of personal, the view that belongs to her alone."
    
    visual_description: |
      The view from the timber-framed mezzanine level, looking down through the
      oak railing at the briefing circle below. The round table is visible in its
      entirety from this angle—maps spread, chairs empty, waiting. Dawn light 
      through the clerestory lancets creates angled bands that will soon track
      across the table.
      
      In the foreground, the mezzanine rail with a lantern resting on it—Veyra's
      lantern, her constant companion. The timber walkway is visible, hardwood
      decking worn smooth from use. Other mezzanine quarters are glimpsed in
      peripheral darkness, their doors closed.
      
      The height is significant—perhaps 15 feet above the floor—creating both
      connection (she can see everything) and separation (she is apart). The
      round table's geometry is perfect from above: no head, no hierarchy, the
      circle complete.
      
    composition_notes: |
      POV shot from mezzanine level, looking down. The lantern on the rail should
      be in the near foreground, slightly out of focus to establish the viewer's
      position. The round table below is the focal point. Include enough of the
      mezzanine walkway and rail to establish location. Dawn light creating the
      first bands across the space.
      
    narrative_significance: |
      This perspective reveals the relationship between leader and led—connected
      but separate, watching over but not hovering. Veyra can observe the briefing
      circle from her quarters, maintain awareness without descending. The lantern
      is her signature—the light she carries through the compound, now resting
      at her private vantage.

    scene_mood: "somber"
    mood_rationale: "The ward exists because people get hurt. It's a place of vulnerability, of care, of the cost made visible. Somber in the sense of serious purpose, the acknowledgment that some don't walk away."
    
    visual_description: |
      The recovery ward in Building C—6 to 10 beds arranged in the quiet wing,
      separated by curtains on rails for privacy. The beds are simple but clean,
      linen white, properly made. Wash stands sit between beds. Shaded lamps
      hang at intervals, their light soft even when lit, designed for night
      rounds without disturbing sleep.
      
      Clerestory glazing fills the space with diffused light—even, calm, nothing
      harsh. The timber-framed partitions and limewash walls are deliberately
      neutral, restful. At the entries, stretcher rails and pegs stand ready,
      a reminder that patients may arrive at any moment.
      
      No patients visible—this is the ward waiting, prepared, the Company's
      promise made physical: if you are hurt, we will care for you.
      
    composition_notes: |
      Medium shot showing the ward's length, beds receding in gentle perspective.
      The curtains should be pulled back to show multiple beds, the organization
      of the space. Soft even lighting throughout. The stretcher rails at the
      entry visible to establish purpose. A sense of calm readiness, not
      emptiness.
      
    narrative_significance: |
      The ward represents the Company's commitment to its people. This isn't just
      triage—it's recovery, the acknowledgment that healing takes time and care.
      The curtains provide dignity; the shaded lamps show thought for patients'
      needs. The stretcher route from gate to ward is maintained because it might
      be needed any moment.
      
    symbolic_elements: |
      The made beds: readiness, expectation. The curtains: dignity in vulnerability.
      The soft light: care extending to every detail. The stretcher rails: the
      connection between action outside and recovery inside.
