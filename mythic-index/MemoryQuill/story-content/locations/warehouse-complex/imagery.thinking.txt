I have:
1. A detailed location_analysis.yaml from the Location Story Analyst
2. Source files (overview.md and description.md) for canon verification
3. No character imagery files provided, but I know from the analysis which characters are associated with this location

## Key Information Extraction

- **Narrative Soul**: "Where the Last Light Company became a family" - disciplined refuge where warriors become family

### Visual Signature (from analysis)
1. Arched stone gatehouse with iron-banded oak leaves, lamp niches
2. Clerestory light shafts striping the round map table in Building A
3. Lantern pools on wet cobbles under covered cartway at night

### Recommended Images from Analysis
Primary:
1. Gatehouse/entrance (establishing) - somber
2. Briefing Circle with round table (essence) - determined
3. Grimjaw's forge (zone) - warm
4. Aldwin's sanctuary (zone) - intimate
5. Night under cartway in rain (temporal) - intimate

Secondary:
6. Briefing at round table - inhabited (determined)


7. Pre-dawn lamp ritual - temporal (somber)
8. Evening meal in mess - inhabited (warm)

Optional:
9. View from mezzanine - perspective (intimate)
10. Courtyard overview - establishing (determined)

I'll capture two additional temporal and inhabited scenes that reveal the complex's intimate character. The pre-dawn lamp ritual suggests a solemn, disciplined moment where warriors prepare for the day, while the evening meal represents warmth and camaraderie. These images will showcase the compound's transformative spaces and the family-like bonds of the Last Light Company.

### Canon Details to Maintain (Visual Anchor)
- Arched stone gatehouse with iron-banded oak double leaves
- 15-ft perimeter wall, >2 ft thick, with pilaster buttresses
- Crowned granite cobbles with trench drains to silt boxes
- Round map table centered in Building A
- High clerestory lancets with iron bars
- Central masonry forge with broad hood and vent

Ventilation flows through roof cowls, creating subtle air currents. A circular sanctuary lined with herbs suggests healing and contemplation. The covered cartway features lantern brackets at each bay, guiding movement and light.

### Materials
Robust, elemental materials define the compound's character. Granite and limestone form a resilient shell, with oak and fir timber providing structural warmth. Metalwork in iron and bronze suggests both utility and craftsmanship.

### Color Anchors
The palette reflects natural materials: granite's grey, limestone's cream, iron's black, oak's amber. The forge's orange glow and seaworn blues contrast these base tones, creating visual depth and emotional resonance.

### Light Character
Light becomes a narrative element. Clerestory bands track across the round table, forge glow casts dancing shadows, lanterns illuminate wet cobbles, and soft diffusion fills Building C. Each space tells a story through its illumination.
