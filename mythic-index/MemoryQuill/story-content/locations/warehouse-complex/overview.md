## Quick Description

A walled, three-building stone compound one block off the working wharves, organized around a crowned, cobbled yard with trench drains and a lantern-lit covered cartway. An arched stone gatehouse with iron-banded leaves controls access. Inside: a high-bay briefing hall with clerestory lancets and a round map table (Building A), a hardened forge-and-engineering workshop with hooded hearth and roof cowls (B), and a quiet infirmary wing with curtained beds and an herb-lined sanctuary (C). Target walls, dog kennels, fire points, and wall anchors signal industrial readiness over ornament.
