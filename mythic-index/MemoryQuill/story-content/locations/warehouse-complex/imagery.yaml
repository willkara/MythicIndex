# NARRATIVE SOUL - Thematic Essence for AI Generation
# ============================================================================
narrative_soul: |
  The Dock Ward Warehouse Complex is where discipline became domesticity and
  work became family. This walled three-building compound one block off the
  working wharves represents the Last Light Company's evolution from desperate
  survivors to functioning organization. Behind the iron-banded gatehouse,
  industrial architecture has been claimed for purpose: the high-bay briefing
  nave with its round map table where operations are planned and debriefed, the
  forge where Grimjaw's hammer finds rhythm and geometric rosettes-that-are-
  definitely-not-flowers appear on spoons, the quiet infirmary wing where
  Aldwin's sanctuary offers healing both physical and spiritual. The covered
  cartway shelters lantern-lit work in any weather; the cobbled yard hosts
  training drills and emergency mobilization. The mezzanine quarters give each
  member their own threshold, boots lined up outside doors in unconscious
  testimony to belonging. This is a place of salt air and forge smoke, of
  morning prep and evening meals shared, of duty boards and alarm bells. When
  Veyra looks down from the mezzanine rail and thinks "this feels like home,"
  the comfort terrifies her even as she embraces it. The warehouse complex is
  industrial-martial competence under civic constraint, a disciplined refuge
  built through small domestic acts—one decorative spoon at a time.

one_line_essence: "Where industrial architecture becomes family home—the Company's headquarters built through discipline and domestic care."
