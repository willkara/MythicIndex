# Dock Ward Warehouse Complex – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Inland side of Waterdeep’s Dock Ward, one block off the working wharves on gently sloping reclaimed ground with packed fill beneath cobbled surfaces. Harbor influence produces salt-laden air, frequent fog banks, wind-driven rain, and brackish damp in low corners. [FIRM: setting; numerous chapter scenes ch21, ch24–ch27, ch29, ch32]
- Site Advantages: Proximity to quays and artisan rows; enclosed yard for secure marshalling and training; large interior volumes for briefing, mess, fabrication, and infirmary operations; covered cartways permit all-weather work.
- Environmental Factors: High humidity, salt corrosion, and industrial soot; periodic ponding at storm peaks mitigated by crowned cobbles and trench drains to silt boxes; winter drafts along windward wall; summer roofspace heat.
- Approach Routes: Two‑cart lane frontage at main gate; east service alley for waste and vendor intake; foot cut‑throughs toward market lanes; quay approach within quick haul distance.

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Late‑medieval urban commercial fabric—load‑bearing stone shells with queen/king‑post timber trusses, high clerestory lancets, and raised thresholds. Ornament minimal; function dictates form.
- Primary Materials:
  - Masonry: Granite footings; rubble‑core walls with dressed granite/limestone faces, 24–30 in thick; lime mortar.
  - Timber: Oak posts/sills, fir or larch trusses; oak mezzanine beams; hardwood decking on catwalks.
  - Roofing: Slate/clay pan‑tile mix; lead flashing; wrought‑iron tie bars and wall anchors.
  - Metalwork: Iron‑banded gates, hinge straps, wall dogs; bronze where corrosion risk is highest (drip edges, lamp brackets).
- Overall Layout: Three rectilinear warehouse buildings (A, B, C) arranged around a central cobbled courtyard within a 15‑ft perimeter wall. Buildings are linked by stone‑roofed covered walkways and lean‑to cart sheds forming a continuous weather‑protected cartway. Single arched gate with adjacent wicket controls access.

## Immersive Sensory Environment

### Visual Landscape
- Dominant Visual Elements: Arched stone gatehouse; high stone shells; clerestory light shafts striking round map table; lantern pools on wet cobbles under the covered cartway; orange forge glow through B’s hood.
- Material Textures: Limewash and dressed stone, soot‑kissed timbers, rope fiber, oiled steel and brass, herb greens and linen whites in C.
- Color Palette: Granite grey, limestone cream, tarred‑black iron, oiled oak amber, forge orange, seaworn blues/greens in damp.
- Light & Shadow: Strong banding through lancets in A; diffused, warm pools at night cartway; steady, calm light in C; flicker and shadow dance in B.

### Acoustic Environment
- Sound Reflection: A reverberant but softened by baffles and banners; B rhythmic—hammer, bellows, chain; C hushed with cloth damping; yard open with gulls and harbor wind.
- Noise Sources: Cart wheel clatter, gate creak, bell rope slap, quench hiss, scullery clink, kettle sigh.
- Acoustic Zones: Loudest at A’s training strip and B’s hearth; quiet sanctuary and isolation bay in C; cartway mid under roofing amplifies footfalls in rain.

### Environmental Atmosphere
- Air Quality: Salt and tar overlaid by forge smoke near B; herbal camphor and mint in C; clean sweep routines keep A dust‑low.
- Scent Profiles: Oiled leather, hot iron, lamp oil, stew and bread, boiled linen, damp stone after rain.
- Physical Comfort: Warm near B; neutral‑to‑cool in A unless braziers lit; sheltered microclimates under cartway and within C’s sanctuary.

## Temporal & Seasonal Variations

### Daily Environmental Changes
- Morning: Forge rekindles; shafts of light track across A; drills commence in yard/strip; vendors admitted via alley. [FIRM: ch25]
- Midday: Doors and louvers propped; full operational tempo across all bays.
- Evening: Shared meal warmth in A; B’s glow reduces; C’s rounds; lantern lighting along cartway.
- Night: Gate secured; watch rotations; lamp‑lit mezzanine; rainwork shifts beneath covered cartway. [FIRM/IMPLIED multi‑chapters]

### Seasonal Adaptations
- Spring: Damp mornings; repointing; ironwork oiling; ventilation checks post‑storm. [FIRM: timeline ch24–ch27]
- Summer: Louvers wide; night‑flush cooling in A; shaded work under cartway.
- Autumn: Gutter clearing; coal and timber stocks raised; shutter maintenance.
- Winter: Draught screens; reduced yard activity; forge heat shared to adjacent bays.

### Weather Response Patterns
- Fair Weather: Yard training at full extents; covered walks used for transit and instruction.
- Storms: Shutters shut; walkway fire doors latched; yard flood gullies opened; drills move indoors beneath cartway and into A.
- Extreme Weather: Gate kept clear; sandbags on low thresholds; stretcher routes checked and marked.
