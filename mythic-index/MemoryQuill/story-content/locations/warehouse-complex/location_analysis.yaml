  narrative_soul: |
    The Dock Ward Warehouse Complex is where the Last Light Company became a family. Behind its iron-banded gates, what was once an industrial compound has been transformed into something both fortress and home—a place where warriors brief for battle around a round table, break bread together in a working mess, and heal in quiet rooms where herbs hang from the ceiling. It embodies the Company's nature: disciplined, competent, and surprisingly warm. The chaos of the harbor district stops at the arched gatehouse; inside is order earned through routine, ritual, and shared purpose.

  transformation_arc: |
    When the Company first arrives (ch19), this is an empty warehouse compound—functional space awaiting purpose. Through the chapters that follow, it becomes inhabited not just with bodies but with meaning. The rhythms established in ch21 (morning drills, shared meals, evening quiet) transform industrial architecture into lived space. By ch32's pre-dawn staging, the compound has become sacred ground—a place people leave to face danger, hoping to return. The transformation isn't physical but relational: the same stone walls mean something different when Veyra's lantern ritual marks dawn, when Aldwin's sanctuary offers quiet counsel, when the mess serves more than food. The tragedy implicit in "provisional HQ" is that this home, so carefully made, may be temporary.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Late-medieval urban commercial adapted for martial-domestic use"
  primary_materials:
    - "Granite footings and dressed limestone faces"
    - "Oak posts, fir/larch trusses"
    - "Slate and clay pan-tile roofing"
    - "Iron-banded gates and hardware; bronze at corrosion points"
  scale_impression: "Substantial but not imposing—three honest working buildings behind walls high enough to matter"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Three signatures define this place visually: First, the arched stone gatehouse with its iron-banded oak leaves, lamp niches flanking the entry, duty board visible within—the face the compound shows the world. Second, the clerestory light shafts in Building A, striping the round map table with moving bands of daylight that track the hours. Third, the lantern pools on wet cobbles under the covered cartway at night—warm amber circles on grey stone in the rain.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Layered industrial rhythms: cart wheel clatter on cobbles, the gate's creak and the wicket's slam, hammer-fall and quench-hiss from the forge, the scullery's clink of crockery. But also the unexpected quiets—the hushed sanctuary in Building C, the pre-dawn stillness before the bell, the way conversations drop to murmurs near the infirmary wing. And always, underneath, the harbor: gulls crying, wind carrying salt, distant dock bells.
    
  scent_signature: |
    A compound scent that changes as you move through: salt and tar at the gate (harbor air), hot iron and coal smoke near the forge, bread and stew from the mess, oiled leather and clean sweat from training, and in Building C, the medicinal green of Aldwin's herbs—camphor, mint, dried flowers. After rain, everything smells of wet stone and cleared air.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Cold granite and rough-dressed limestone under the hand; the worn smooth oak of the mess tables; the rope-fiber texture of training lines; the particular warmth radiating from forge bricks versus brazier warmth in the briefing hall. In C, softer touches: linen curtains, herbal sachets, the cool ceramic of wash basins. The air shifts from Building B's dry forge heat to C's controlled, slightly humid quiet.

  light_character: |
    Light in this compound tells time and tells stories. Building A's clerestory lancets create moving stripes of daylight across the briefing circle—morning light from the east, afternoon from the west, the round table marked by passing bands. The forge in B glows orange through its hood, casting dancing shadows that ripple across the workshop walls. At night, the covered cartway becomes a series of amber lantern pools on grey cobbles, especially beautiful in rain when light reflects off wet stone. Building C keeps its light soft and diffuse—clerestory glazing, shaded lamps, the gentle ambiance of a place meant for rest. The yard at pre-dawn is particular: darkness lifting, first lanterns lit, Veyra's ritual lamp route marking the compound's waking.
    
  weather_influence: |
    The harbor brings weather constantly: salt-laden air that blooms white on winter mortar joints, frequent fog banks that muffle the yard in grey, wind-driven rain that makes the covered cartway essential. Storm shutters exist for a reason—violent weather from the sea forces everything indoors or under cover. But weather also creates atmosphere: the compound in rain, with lantern-lit pools on wet cobbles and people moving quickly under covered walks, has a particular intimacy. Summer heat makes the forge nearly unbearable without the ventilation cowls; winter drafts along the windward wall drive residents toward the mess's warmth.

contextual_place:
  region: "Dock Ward, Waterdeep"
  neighborhood_character: |
    The Dock Ward is Waterdeep's working gut—busy wharves, artisan rows, taverns for sailors, warehouses for trade. Industrial, chaotic, alive at all hours with harbor activity. The compound sits one block off the working wharves, close enough to smell salt and hear dock bells, far enough to maintain its walled isolation. The neighborhood is commercial-industrial, not residential—the company's neighbors are merchants, factors, teamsters, and the constant flow of harbor labor. This isn't a quiet place; the compound's walls exist to create quiet within chaos.

      A round-arched stone gatehouse set in the 15-ft perimeter wall. Iron-banded oak double leaves, 12-14 ft clear width, with a 3-ft wicket door for foot traffic. Lamp niches flank the arch; within the deep reveal sits the duty board, muster bell, and queue ropes for guest screening. The voussoirs are dressed stone, the ironwork heavy but well-maintained. The gate's creak when it opens is the compound's first and last sound for those coming and going.

    physical_description: |
      Approximately 120 ft × 100 ft of crowned granite cobbles, the yard is the compound's operational heart. Trench drains (12-16 in wide) run to silt boxes with iron grates, managing the frequent rain. Stone standpipe taps sit at two corners. The yard's edges are defined by the covered cartway's lean-to sheds along the windward walls, the three building faces, and the perimeter wall. Training amenities include an archery target wall with straw butts and timber backstops, sand troughs, and space for drill formations. Dog kennels shelter against the windward wall. A muster point beneath the bell provides assembly space.
      
    narrative_function: "The compound's common ground—where the Company gathers, trains, marshals for operations, receives deliveries.

    physical_description: |
      A circular herb-lined room at the heart of Building C's infirmary wing. Low heat from a small hearth; an incense flue carries gentle smoke. Herbs hang from the ceiling and line the walls—medicinal plants, dried flowers, aromatic bundles. The space is designed for calm: controlled acoustics, soft light through clerestory glazing, the sensory signature of growing things and gentle warmth. This is where Aldwin provides counsel, where patients find peace beyond physical healing.
      
    narrative_function: "The spiritual center of the infirmary—and perhaps of the compound. Aldwin's sanctuary represents healing beyond the body: counsel, comfort, the restoration of spirit. The circular shape, the herbs, the gentle warmth create a space outside military routine. Here, warriors can be vulnerable; here, the Company's care for its people becomes tangible."

      A 6-10 bed recovery ward within Building C's quiet wing. Beds separated by curtains for privacy; stretcher rails and pegs at entries for incoming patients. Wash stands between beds; lamp shades for night rounds allow care without disturbing sleep. Timber-framed partitions within the stone shell; limewash finish on walls. Clerestory glazing provides diffuse natural light. The space is deliberately calm: thick curtains and baffles for sound control, controlled airflow, the atmosphere of a place designed for rest.
      
    narrative_function: "Where the wounded heal. The ward represents the Company's commitment to its people: injuries are not just treated but tended. The curtained beds provide dignity; the quiet atmosphere acknowledges that healing requires peace.
