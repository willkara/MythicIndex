creatures:
  - name: Crate Creeper
    description: Flat, many-legged creatures that live in the gaps between stacked crates and cargo. They've adapted perfectly to warehouse life, feeding on spilled goods and nesting in long-term storage. Harmless but unsettling, they can squeeze through impossibly narrow gaps.
    visual_aspects:
      - Paper-thin bodies that can compress to nearly two-dimensional
      - Segmented with dozens of tiny legs along each side
      - Color and pattern perfectly matches wood grain of common crates
      - Length of 1-2 feet when extended
      - Multiple eyes in a row along leading edge
    habitat:
      where: Between stacked cargo, inside hollow crates, under pallets
      when: Nocturnal; hide perfectly during warehouse operating hours
      why: Feed on spilled grain, leaked oils, and warehouse pests
    behavior:
      who: Live in small family groups in specific storage areas
      what: Clean up spills and keep pest populations controlled
      how: Can flatten themselves to slide through gaps narrower than a coin
    lore: Experienced warehouse workers appreciate Crate Creepers—they eat the pests and alert workers to damaged cargo by clustering around leaks. But new employees often panic upon discovering them, leading to a traditional hazing where veterans leave newcomers alone in storage areas after dark.

  - name: Inventory Ghost
    description: Spectral manifestation of a long-dead quartermaster still maintaining records. Appears as a translucent figure endlessly counting, checking, and reorganizing supplies that may no longer exist. Sometimes provides useful information about forgotten storage areas.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent elderly human in outdated Company uniform
      - Always holding a ledger and making notation gestures
      - Lips move constantly as if counting under breath
      - Glows with faint blue light, brighter when frustrated
      - Doesn't acknowledge living people but works around them
    habitat:
      where: Main warehouse floor and record keeping areas
      when: Most visible during inventory counts and shift changes
      why: Died during duty; obsession with perfect records anchors spirit
    behavior:
      who: Single spirit, believed to be Sergeant Oldric "Tally" Merchson, died 1398 DR
      what: Endlessly recounts inventory, reorganizes manifests, checks supplies
      how: Can't interact physically but sometimes causes lost items to "appear"
    lore: Workers swear that if you're missing something, ask Tally where it is out loud. If he heard where it was stored in his lifetime, the item mysteriously turns up in an obvious place within a day. He once "helped" locate a crate of emergency medical supplies that had been misfiled for six years.

  - name: Dust Devil Sentry
    description: Animated swirls of warehouse dust and debris that patrol the perimeter. Created accidentally by protective wards interfacing with accumulated dirt, they now serve as unauthorized but effective security. They alert to intrusions by creating visible dust clouds.
    visual_aspects:
      - Spinning columns of dust, wood shavings, and debris
      - Height varies from 2-6 feet depending on available material
      - Cores glow faintly with ward magic—blue for the Company's protective spells
      - Move with purposeful, patrol-like patterns
      - Leave clean paths on dusty floors where they've passed
    habitat:
      where: Perimeter areas near walls and doors
      when: Active during closed hours; dissipate when warehouse is busy
      why: Spontaneous manifestation from security wards plus environmental dust
    behavior:
      who: Multiple individual sentries, reform each night from available dust
      what: Patrol warehouse perimeter; create noise and visible signs when detecting intrusions
      how: Sense ward boundaries being crossed; respond by spinning faster and louder
    lore: The first Dust Devil appeared the night after new wards were installed. Cidri Ashwalker spent a week trying to dispel them before realizing they were actually helping. Now they're an accepted part of warehouse security—and a convenient excuse for why the floors are always swept clean in the morning.

  - name: Rope Rat
    description: Rodents that have developed the ability to stiffen their tails and limbs to mimic rope and cable. They infiltrate cargo by posing as tie-downs, then feast on goods during transport. Clever enough to return to rope form if discovered.
    visual_aspects:
      - Rat-sized rodents with unusually long, prehensile tails
      - Fur in browns and tans matching hemp rope colors
      - Can stiffen entire body into rigid rope-like configuration
      - Leave oily residue and fraying where they've been posing as rope
      - Eyes remain visible as dark knots even when transformed
    habitat:
      where: Anywhere rope and cable are stored; among cargo tie-downs
      when: Transform during day when warehouse is busy; feed at night
      why: Evolutionary adaptation for hiding from predators and accessing food
    behavior:
      who: Individuals or small family groups infiltrating shipments
      what: Pose as rope to avoid detection; resume normal form to feed
      how: Can hold rope form for hours; released tension and resume normal shape at will
    lore: More than one carter has grabbed what they thought was a tie-down rope, only to have it squeak and run. The Company now has a standing policy: always tug hard on ropes before using them. If they squeak, they're Rope Rats. If they don't, they're probably actual rope.
