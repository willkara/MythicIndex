    An unremarkable merchant's inn in Stonebridge that serves as an operational safe house.
    Its very mundanity provides perfect cover for sensitive meetings and surveillance.
    The visual key is capturing "deliberate forgettability" - functional comfort without
    any distinctive features that might fix in memory. Privacy through indifference.

# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Essential Truth of This Place
# ============================================================================

narrative_soul: |
  The Shepherd's Rest exists to be forgotten. It is not worn or tired but simply
  unremarkable - the kind of establishment travelers describe as "fine" and cannot
  recall a week later. Its rooms are clean without character, its common room adequate
  without charm, its innkeeper pleasant without being memorable. This very anonymity
  makes it perfect for those who need to meet unseen and plan unremembered.

  When Cidri's team gathers here after the Bastion heist, the room's bland functionality
  serves as neutral ground for complicated emotions - relief, guilt, the weight of
  violence justified by necessity. The unremarkable surroundings become a frame that
  throws their extraordinary circumstances into sharp relief.

  description: |
    The Shepherd's Rest Inn presents exactly what it advertises - a two-story
    timber-frame building of standard Stonebridge commercial construction, its
    whitewashed walls and dark-stained beams indistinguishable from a dozen
    similar establishments on neighboring streets. A modest sign depicts a
    shepherd's crook, carved competently but without artistry. The courtyard
    visible through an archway shows practical cobblestones and a functional
    well, nothing more.

    description: |
      The common room of the Shepherd's Rest embodies functional adequacy - clean tables,
      sturdy benches, a modest fireplace that provides warmth without becoming a gathering
      point. The ceiling is low enough to feel contained but not oppressive. Merchants
      eat their meals here in comfortable silence, conducting business in low voices that
      don't carry. The serving staff move efficiently without soliciting conversation.

    key_elements:

    description: |
      The cobbled courtyard serves as a practical transition between street and inn,
      offering stabling facilities and a functional well. Its high walls ensure privacy
      without creating a sense of enclosure. Merchants' horses stand in unremarkable stalls,
      their tack plain and serviceable. The space exists for logistics, not atmosphere.

    zone_name: "Interior Stairwell"
    zone_type: "liminal"

    description: |
      A narrow wooden staircase connects the common room to the second-floor guest rooms.
      The steps are worn smooth by countless boots but remain structurally sound. A single
      window on the landing provides adequate light during day hours. At night, a wall-mounted
      lamp serves the same function without distinction.

      The guest rooms are studies in adequate comfort - narrow beds with clean linens,
      a washstand with functional basin, a small table and chair for correspondence,
      hooks for hanging clothes. Each room has a single window looking out to the street
      below. The furnishings are identical across all rooms, making it impossible to
      remember which specific room one occupied. This is by design.

    key_elements:
      - "Narrow bed with clean undyed wool blanket"
      - "Simple pine washstand with ceramic basin"
      - "Small writing table with single chair"

      These identical rooms serve different purposes across the narrative - anonymous
      accommodation for traveling merchants, surveillance posts overlooking the street,
      and private spaces for complicated post-mission emotions.

    zone_type: "perspective"

    description: |
      From the second-floor windows, guests can observe Stonebridge's commercial district
      without drawing attention. The view encompasses the street below, neighboring shop
      fronts, and the flow of merchant traffic. For operatives, these windows provide
      excellent surveillance positions while maintaining perfect innocence - any merchant
      might watch the street while contemplating business.

    key_elements:
      - "Street scene visible through plain window frame"
      - "Neighboring buildings of similar construction"
      - "Merchant foot traffic below"

      framing: "window frame establishing vantage point"
      focus: "street scene sharp, interior edges soft"

    narrative_moment: |
      This perspective defines the inn's operational value - the ability to watch
      without being watched, to see the street's rhythm and spot anomalies.

    zone_name: "Guest Room at Night"
    zone_type: "temporal"

    description: |
      At night, the guest rooms become pools of lamplight in surrounding darkness.
      The single oil lamp on the bedside table casts a small warm circle that barely
      reaches the walls. Outside the window, the street is quiet but not silent -
      occasional footsteps, a distant dog, the normal sounds of a district at rest.

    key_elements:
      - "Oil lamp creating intimate circle of light"
      - "Bed and furniture partially visible in glow"
      - "Window showing dark street beyond"

    description: |
      A larger corner room sometimes used for merchant negotiations serves equally well
      for operational planning. It contains a table large enough to spread maps or documents,
      several chairs, and windows on two walls providing both light and escape routes.
      The room is rented by the day to merchants who need privacy for deals - or to
      operatives who need privacy for other purposes.

    key_elements:
      - "Larger table suitable for documents or maps"

      This space hosts the planning session for the Bastion warehouse operation -
      maps spread on the table, routes discussed, contingencies planned. The room's
      anonymity contains their conspiracy like water in a vessel.

    description: |
      The team gathered around the table, maps and notes spread between them. The
      Bastion Lock sits at the center - that ancient mechanism that will grant them
      access to the warehouse's secured vault. Faces are intent, voices low, the
      discussion weighing risk against necessity. The bland room around them makes
      their dangerous purpose feel almost mundane.

      the gravity of what they're planning.

    description: |
      An operative positioned at the window, curtain held slightly aside, watching
      the street below with patient attention. From this vantage, patterns emerge -
      when guards change, which merchants follow regular schedules, where foot traffic
      thins. The watching is invisible from below, just another merchant idly looking
      out while contemplating business.

    key_elements:
      - "Figure at window, partially concealed by curtain"

      After the warehouse operation, the team returns to the Shepherd's Rest in
      complicated silence. The rooms that served as planning spaces now host
      aftermath - the processing of violence, the weight of necessity, the particular
      exhaustion that follows crisis. The bland surroundings offer no comfort but
      also make no demands, allowing space for whatever emotions need processing.

      in the silence. The bland room offers no distraction from the accounting.

      for that complexity.

      Morning light fills the room as the team prepares to leave. The operation is
      complete, the Shepherd's Rest has served its purpose, and soon they'll be gone

      merchants with unremarkable business. The room shows signs of recent occupancy

      Through a briefly opened door, a glimpse of the inn's kitchen - copper pots,

      The innkeeper embodies the establishment's ethos - pleasant without being
      memorable, efficient without being intrusive. Middle-aged, unremarkable
      features, an apron that's clean but not new. He (or she) processes guests
      with the same attentive indifference given to accounting ledgers, providing
      exactly what's needed and nothing more.

      Patient surveillance from the window - watching the street below, learning its

      In the gray pre-dawn, Cidri sits alone in the unremarkable room, processing
      what the night required. The heist succeeded. The violence was necessary.
      Both truths exist simultaneously without resolving. The bland room offers no
      absolution and demands no justification - it simply holds space for the
      complicated arithmetic of conscience.

      Victory has a price. This image captures the moment of reckoning - not
      guilt exactly, but the weight of necessity. The heist was right but not
      clean. Both truths require acknowledgment.
