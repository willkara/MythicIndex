    one building among several similar establishments. The viewer's eye almost\ 

    slides past the inn—that's the point. Standard timber-and-stone construction,\ 

    modest painted sign, nothing to distinguish it from the merchant's office on\ 

    one side or the trader's warehouse on the other. The only feature that rewards\ 

    attention: second-floor windows glowing with lamplight, hinting at the\ 

    significance hidden within. A few figures on the street, merchants concluding\

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            - character portraits (identity references)

            - a location overview (environment reference)

            - style references (art direction)


            Generate a NEW scene matching the scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Avoid “real-world medieval Europe” drift; keep fantasy species variety and magical infrastructure plausible and grounded-in-world (not neon).

            5. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.


            SCENARIO: work table with documents and planning materials, oil lamp providing warm illumination, two to three figures gathered in close discussion, street-view window showing dark street beyond, modest room furnishings pushed aside for work, serious, focused expressions, deliberately unremarkable timber-and-stone facade, second-floor windows overlooking street (surveillance capability), modest painted signage without distinctive embellishment, blending seamlessly with neighboring commercial buildings, functional adequacy without architectural distinction, enchanted wayfinder sign (subtle glow only at dusk, not neon), warded threshold charm to keep vermin and ill-luck out, a mixed traveler crowd (human, dwarf, halfling, elf) passing through, Evening in the second-floor room, transformed from sleeping quarters to operational headquarters. The work table now serves its true purpose—covered with papers, perhaps a rough map or warehouse sketch, notes from intelligence gathering. Two or three Company members gathered close, lamplight casting warm shadows on focused faces. One figure gestures at the documents, another leans in to see. The street-view window shows darkness beyond—night has fallen, but the work continues. The bed pushed aside, the room given over to planning. This is the serious business that happens in anonymous places., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: This is the heart of the Shepherd's Rest's narrative function: the room where the Croft warehouse infiltration is planned. The image captures the soul of operational work—not dramatic action but careful preparation, the serious conversations that precede dangerous deeds., Medium shot, table as focal point with figures arranged around it. Lamplight from single source (oil lamp on table) creates warm pool of illumination, faces lit from below and side. The window in background shows dark street, providing context without dominating. Composition emphasizes the closeness of the figures—they're working together, not merely in proximity., evening/night, irrelevant (interior), light from oil lamp on table, warm pool of light, intimate radius, from center-table, illuminating faces from below/side, warm amber lamplight tones, deep beyond the lamp's reach shadows, the world shrunk to the circle of light, dominant colors: amber lamplight, warm wood tones, parchment cream, shadow brown and black; accent colors: skin tones in warm light, dark blue of night window, high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: timber framing with local stone foundation and lower walls, plaster interior walls, worn but maintained, wood plank flooring, well-trodden, Mood intent: The intimate mood captures the closeness of shared dangerous purpose—figures gathered together, heads bent over plans, the warm lamplight creating a circle of trust within the anonymous room. This is collaboration, not command.

            1. LOCATION IDENTITY: Preserve architecture, materials, lighting language, and signature elements from the references.

            2. FANTASY TONE: This is a high-fantasy world (D&D / Faerûn vibe). Include subtle magical infrastructure (runes, enchanted lanterns, ward-stones, guild sigils) where appropriate.

            3. NO FACE CLONING: If people appear, keep them generic and varied—do not repeat an identical face across images unless explicitly required.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            5. PRIORITY: If the scenario conflicts with the references, follow the scenario for composition/mood while preserving the location’s identity.

            Generate a NEW image of this SAME location in the described scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. LOCATION IDENTITY: Preserve architecture, materials, lighting language, and signature elements from the references.

            2. FANTASY TONE: This is a high-fantasy world (D&D / Faerûn vibe). Include subtle magical infrastructure (runes, enchanted lanterns, ward-stones, guild sigils) where appropriate.

            3. NO FACE CLONING: If people appear, keep them generic and varied—do not repeat an identical face across images unless explicitly required.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            5. PRIORITY: If the scenario conflicts with the references, follow the scenario for composition/mood while preserving the location’s identity.

Practical raised beds with kitchen herbs and hardy vegetables. A bench sits against the warm stone wall. It is quiet, away from the street's noise. Sunlight hits the green leaves. This is where the innkeeper might go to not-see things for a moment., Faerûn high-fantasy interior cues (subtle, believable magic): enchanted lanterns/sconces, rune-inlaid beams, warding motifs worked into stone and metal, arcane guild seals and sigils as functional infrastructure, Narrative context: Even a place of anonymity has a heart, a source of sustenance. The mundane foundation of the sanctuary., Medium shot. Greenery in foreground, stone wall background. Peaceful, enclosed composition., morning, light from sunlight, soft, natural, dominant colors: leaf green, stone grey, soil black; accent colors: cream plaster, lamplight gold, high fantasy, pastoral atmosphere, materials: timber framing with local stone foundation and lower walls, plaster interior walls, worn but maintained, wood plank flooring, well-trodden, Mood intent: A rare moment of organic life and softness in a place of stone and secrets. A breather.

            , epic high-fantasy exterior, fantastical silhouettes and skyline, arcane lanterns and ward-lights, subtle magical phenomena integrated into the environment, dynamic skies, cinematic composition, atmospheric depth, Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.
