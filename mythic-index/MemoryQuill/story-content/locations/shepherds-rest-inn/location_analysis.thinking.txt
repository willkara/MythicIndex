Let me analyze the Shepherd's Rest Inn location files systematically.

## Understanding the Location

From the files, I can extract:

**Physical Truth:**
- Standard timber-and-stone construction
- Second-floor guest rooms with street-view windows
- One street off Stonebridge market square
- Unremarkable architecture - deliberately so
- Common areas are functional, not social
- Clean but not luxurious

**Narrative Soul:**
- "Exactly as advertised—unremarkable in every way that mattered"
- Safety through anonymity
- Serves as operational safe house
- Discretion is the primary service
- A place where the extraordinary can hide in plain sight

**Character-Space Relationships:**
- The Company used it during their Silas Croft investigation
- The innkeeper is notably incurious - "barely looked at them twice"
- This is a one-time location for the story

**Temporal States:**
- Single appearance (Chapter 11)
- Used for planning sessions and intelligence gathering

**Contextual Place:**
- Stonebridge - river trade town
- Near market square but not in the thick of it
- Commercial surroundings

## Zone Classification

For this minor location, I can identify:
1. **Guest Rooms (Second Floor)** - This is where the Company operates; has sanctuary/forge qualities (planning)
2. **Common Areas** - Commons/threshold
3. **Entry/Exterior** - Threshold

## Key Visual Opportunities

Given this is a minor location with limited story presence:
1. An establishing shot showing the deliberate unremarkability
2. The interior of a second-floor room where planning happens - the view from the window
3. The innkeeper's studied indifference

The challenge here is that the location's DEFINING characteristic is being visually forgettable. That's actually interesting - how do you illustrate "deliberate anonymity"?

The visual hook might be:
- The window view looking down at Stonebridge streets (surveillance perspective)


- A planning session in the room - maps spread out, figures conferring
- The contrast between the mundane setting and the significant work happening within

I see a powerful narrative moment where the unremarkable space becomes a crucible for critical decision-making. The room's bland exterior masks intense strategic planning, creating a compelling visual and narrative tension. The maps scattered across a simple wooden table, characters huddled close, their whispered conversations contrasting sharply with the mundane inn surroundings - this speaks to the core of covert operations.

The window becomes a key symbolic element - a threshold between the ordinary street below and the extraordinary work unfolding inside. It's a perfect metaphor for the location's entire purpose: blending in while enabling something remarkable.
