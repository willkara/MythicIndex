  narrative_soul: |
    The Shepherd's Rest is anonymity made manifest—a place that exists precisely because 
    it refuses to be memorable. It represents the operational reality of adventuring work: 
    sometimes safety isn't a fortified position, but the ability to disappear into the 
    unremarkable. Here, the extraordinary can conduct extraordinary business while hiding 
    in plain sight among merchants and traders who ask no questions.
    
  one_line_essence: "Where the unremarkable becomes refuge"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "Safety through anonymity"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "The gap between appearance and significance"
      - "Professional discretion as service"
      - "The hidden machinery of adventuring work"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "Forgettable exterior vs. significant interior events"
      - "Commercial normalcy vs. dangerous work"
      - "Indifference as both service and protection"

  transformation_arc: |
    The Shepherd's Rest doesn't transform—that's the point. It remains exactly what it 
    advertises: unremarkable, functional, forgettable. The transformation happens to 
    those within it. The Company arrives scattered with gathered intelligence and leaves 
    unified with a plan to infiltrate Croft's warehouse. The inn is a chrysalis that 
    doesn't change while its occupants do.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Standard Stonebridge commercial timber-and-stone"
  primary_materials:
    - "Timber framing"
    - "Local stone foundation and lower walls"
    - "Plaster interior walls"
    - "Wood plank floors"
  scale_impression: "Modest, unremarkable—deliberately sized to avoid notice"
  
  visual_signature: |
    The defining visual characteristic is the absence of distinctive features. Where 
    other inns might have carved signs, distinctive paint, or memorable architectural 
    flourishes, the Shepherd's Rest offers only functional adequacy. The most 
    distinctive element is the second-floor windows overlooking the street—the only 
    feature that hints at the surveillance value hidden within mundane appearances.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Quiet in the way of professional establishments. Footsteps on worn wooden stairs. 
    The muffled sounds of Stonebridge commerce filtering through windows. No tavern 
    revelry, no boisterous common room—just the businesslike hush of travelers who 
    prefer not to be noticed.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Clean but unremarkable. Aired linens, a hint of wood polish, perhaps cooking from 
    a modest kitchen. Nothing memorable—no distinctive spices, no strong hearth smoke. 
    The olfactory equivalent of the visual anonymity.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Adequate comfort without luxury. Beds that serve their purpose. Worn but maintained 
    wood surfaces. The functional warmth of a commercial building that sees regular 
    traffic but no particular care for ambiance.

  light_character: |
    Natural light through street-facing windows. Interior spaces likely lit by 
    functional oil lamps or candles—nothing elaborate. The light quality would be 
    adequate for work without being particularly warm or atmospheric.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Standard protection from elements. Windows allow street observation while 
    providing shelter. During the Company's use, weather appears unremarkable—the 
    inn simply functions as expected.

contextual_place:
  region: "Stonebridge, a market town on the Silver Rush river"
  neighborhood_character: |
    Commercial district adjacent to the main market square. Surrounded by merchant 
    businesses, trade goods, the bustle of river commerce. The Shepherd's Rest sits 
    just off the main thoroughfare—close enough for convenience, removed enough for 
    discretion. The kind of street where travelers lodge without attracting attention.
    
  approach_sequences:
    - name: "From the market square"
      description: |
        One street off the square, past merchant stalls and trade offices. The inn 
        appears as just another commercial building among many.
      first_impression: |
        Unremarkable by design. You might walk past it without noticing. That's the 
        point.
        
    - name: "From the five-arch bridge"
      description: |
        Through Stonebridge's commercial heart, the inn is one of many lodging options 
        for traders crossing the Silver Rush.
      first_impression: |
        One option among several, distinguished only by its convenient anonymity.
      
  visible_beyond:
    - direction: "From second-floor windows"
      what_visible: "Street traffic, nearby buildings, approaches to the inn"
    - direction: "Toward market square"
      what_visible: "Commercial bustle, merchant activity, the flow of trade"
      
  spatial_relationship: |
    The Shepherd's Rest exists in the commercial penumbra of Stonebridge's market 
    square—close enough to benefit from the town's trade traffic, removed enough 
    to avoid the constant scrutiny of the busiest areas. A perfect operational 
    position.

    physical_description: |
      A modest facade on a commercial street. Standard inn signage, unremarkable 
      door, nothing to distinguish it from surrounding establishments. The kind of 
      building that serves as background in a busy town.
      
    narrative_function: |
      First impression and last—the exterior establishes the inn's core promise: 
      forgettability. It's the visual contract between establishment and guest.

    physical_description: |
      Merchant-class accommodations—clean, functional, adequate. The key feature 
      is the street-view windows, providing both natural light and observation 
      capability. Rooms large enough for small group meetings, furnished with 
      standard beds, a table, perhaps a washstand.
      
    narrative_function: |
      The operational heart of the Company's Stonebridge work. Here intelligence 
      is gathered, plans are made, the warehouse infiltration is organized. The

      Functional rather than social. A place for transactions, not lingering. 
      Minimal seating, efficient service area. The atmosphere discourages 
      extended stays or casual conversation.
      
    narrative_function: |
      The space where discretion is institutionalized. Guests pass through
