# Shepherd's Rest Inn – Overview

## Basic Information
- **Type**: Merchant's inn
- **Region**: Stonebridge, one street off the market square
- **First Appearance**: Chapter 11 – "An Honest Coin"
- **Significance Level**: Minor (operational safe house)

## Quick Description
An unremarkable inn in Stonebridge, exactly as advertised—nondescript in every way that matters. Second-floor rooms with street-view windows, an innkeeper who barely looks at guests twice, and the kind of deliberate anonymity that makes it perfect for those conducting delicate business. The sort of establishment where discretion is the primary service offered.

## Visual Summary
- **Exterior**: Modest structure without distinctive architectural features; blends with commercial surroundings
- **Rooms**: Second-floor accommodations with windows overlooking the street
- **Common Areas**: Functional rather than memorable; clean but not luxurious
- **Atmosphere**: Neutral, professional, deliberately forgettable
- **Construction**: Standard timber-and-stone typical of Stonebridge commercial buildings

## Story Role
- **Plot Relevance**: Served as headquarters for the Last Light Company during their investigation of Silas Croft's corruption and the warehouse infiltration
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Safety through anonymity—a place where the extraordinary can hide in plain sight
- **Recurring Location**: No (single appearance)
- **Key Events**: Company reconvened here after gathering intelligence; planning sessions for warehouse operation

## Operational Characteristics
- **Cover Value**: Excellent—merchant travelers are the norm; no questions asked
- **Security**: Privacy through policy rather than physical measures
- **Innkeeper**: Notably incurious; "barely looked at them twice"
- **Clientele**: Merchants, traders, traveling adventurers, business-focused travelers

## Functional Notes
- **Room Features**: Street-view windows (useful for surveillance), standard merchant-class accommodations
- **Privacy Level**: High—staff respect guest privacy without explicit agreements
- **Service**: Adequate but unremarkable; the anonymity is the amenity
- **Location**: One street off Stonebridge's main market square; close to commercial activity but not in the thick of it
