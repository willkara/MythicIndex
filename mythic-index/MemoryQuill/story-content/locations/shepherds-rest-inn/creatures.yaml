The innkeeper, a former adventurer herself, understands what it means to need safe rest.

  - name: Hearth Keeper

A young innkeeper once asked why it stayed. Ember replied: "This is a place where tired people find rest. That's work worth doing." It's been the inn's philosophy ever since.

    lore: The innkeeper's grandmother planted the lavender garden and tended it with such love that it awakened a spirit.

One couple arrived mid-argument; by morning they'd reconciled, both claiming they'd dreamed of peaceful lavender fields.

      - Body the size of a large apple, with legs spanning a dinner plate
      - Bright colors unusual in spiders—reds, golds, and blues

      - Completely harmless and surprisingly friendly
    habitat:
      where: Upper corners of common room and gathering areas

      why: Feeds on narrative energy; creates art from stories
    behavior:

    lore: Children beg for stories when the Story Spinner is active—its webs make tales come alive. A bard once shared an epic of dragon-slaying; the web showed every scene in perfect detail. When he finished, the spider approached and dropped a single thread into his hand—solidified into golden string worth a fortune. The bard left it pinned to the inn's wall with a note: "Payment for the best audience I ever had."
