  narrative_soul: |
    The Silken Siren is Waterdeep's shadow economy given form—a place where 
    information is currency and fear is architecture. There are no guards, 
    no locks, no visible threats. The security is social: everyone who enters 
    already knows the rules, and the consequences for breaking them are 
    understood without ever being spoken. When a seasoned fence refuses gold 
    rather than answer a question, you've learned everything you need to know 
    about who truly controls this city's darker currents.
    
  one_line_essence: "Where fear polices what walls cannot"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "The invisible hand of underworld power"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Information as weapon and shield"
      - "Self-policing through shared fear"
      - "The price of knowledge"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "Transaction vs. danger—even coin can't buy safety"
      - "Discretion vs. paranoia—privacy that imprisons"
      - "Professional competence vs. existential fear"

  transformation_arc: |
    The Silken Siren doesn't change through the story—it reveals. Marcus's 
    visit exposes the reach of protection networks (implied Silent Hand) that 
    turn even professional information brokers into fearful gatekeepers. The 
    location functions as a demonstration: Korrath Threnx is not merely 
    criminal, but *protected* at levels that make hardened fences refuse gold.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Unspecified in canon—extrapolate as urban Waterdeep commercial"
  primary_materials:
    - "Dark wood (implied from atmosphere)"
    - "Sound-dampening fabrics (implied)"
    - "Stone or brick exterior (Waterdeep standard)"
  scale_impression: "Intimate, moderate capacity—quality over quantity clientele"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Tables positioned as islands of privacy in a dim room. Every patron has 
    sightlines to exits. The spacing between conversations is deliberate—
    secrets don't travel here. Staff are professionally invisible. Nothing 
    overtly threatening, yet danger saturates every surface.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Weighted silence. Conversations exist as murmurs, never rising above 
    hushed exchange. No laughter. No raised voices. Words are measured, 
    weighed, spent carefully. The quiet has teeth.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Unspecified in canon. Suggest: old wood polish, candle wax, possibly 
    pipe smoke—nothing that calls attention.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    The sensation of being watched. Temperature is neutral—not comfortable, 
    not uncomfortable. What you feel is psychological: the weight of 
    awareness, the pressure of unspoken rules.

  light_character: |
    Dim enough for discretion, bright enough to read faces. Likely candle or 
    lantern light—warm but insufficient to illuminate corners. Shadows are 
    features, not flaws. Light pools at individual tables but doesn't reach 
    between them.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Interior space—weather irrelevant to function. Windows (if present) 
    would be shuttered or curtained for privacy.

contextual_place:
  region: "Waterdeep (specific ward unspecified)"
  neighborhood_character: |
    Canon leaves district unspecified. The clientele (fences, arcane 
    specialists, information brokers) suggests proximity to both legitimate 
    trade and shadow economy access points. Not a slum—the clientele is 
    professional. Not a showcase district—discretion requires obscurity.

      The Silken Siren's power is atmospheric—fear as security, discretion 
      as survival. A single establishing shot can capture this: the dim pools 
      of light, the isolated tables, the glances toward exits. This is the 
      visual vocabulary of Waterdeep's shadow economy.

    rationale: |
      This is the narrative core of the Silken Siren's single appearance—
      the moment when professional greed loses to existential fear. The

      than gold can pay.
