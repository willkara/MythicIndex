  generation_notes: |
    An information trading establishment where Waterdeep's shadow economy conducts its
    most sensitive business. The atmosphere is its security system—palpable tension,
    nervous glances toward exits, and the unspoken understanding that wrong questions
    bring consequences. Fear and discretion permeate every surface. This is not a
    place of violence but of implied consequence, where fences refuse gold rather
    than speak certain names.

# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Essential Truth of This Place
# ============================================================================

narrative_soul: |
  The Silken Siren exists in the shadows between what is known and what is dangerous
  to know. Here, information brokers trade secrets like currency, fences move magical
  artifacts, and arcane specialists network away from official eyes. The establishment's
  security isn't physical—it's atmospheric. Everyone who enters understands the rules
  without being told: some topics are off-limits, some people are protected, and wrong
  questions bring "visits from unpleasant people."

  When Marcus Heartbridge came seeking information about Korrath Threnx, even his gold
  couldn't buy answers. The fence's refusal spoke louder than any threat—"That name is
  poison." The Silken Siren teaches its rules through tension, through glances toward
  exits, through the weight of words carefully weighed before speaking.

  description: |
    The Silken Siren's interior reveals itself in careful layers—tables arranged
    for privacy, each a island of soft lantern light in a sea of shadow. Patrons
    lean close in hushed conversation, their eyes occasionally flickering toward
    exits. Staff move like ghosts, appearing only when needed, vanishing the moment
    service is complete. The atmosphere itself speaks of consequence, of danger

    zone_name: "The Alley Entrance"
    zone_type: "threshold"

    description: |
      The Silken Siren doesn't advertise. Those who need to know, know. The entrance
      is through a narrow alley, unmarked save for those who recognize the signs—a
      particular lamp, a specific pattern in the stonework. The transition from street
      to shadow marks the boundary between the public world and the shadow economy.

    key_elements:

    zone_type: "perspective"

    description: |
      Crossing the threshold, a newcomer feels the weight of the room immediately.
      Conversations don't stop but they quiet. Eyes assess without staring. The
      heavy silence presses in—this is a place where every word is weighed, where
      observation is constant, where the wrong question can be fatal.

    narrative_moment: |
      This is Marcus's perspective when he entered seeking information about
      Korrath—the immediate sense that this place has rules, that he is being
      assessed, that every word will have consequence.

  # MAIN FLOOR
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - zone_id: "main-exchange-floor"
    zone_name: "Main Exchange Floor"
    zone_type: "commons"

    description: |
      The main floor is an architecture of privacy—tables spaced far enough that
      conversations don't overlap, seating arranged so patrons can observe exits
      while speaking in confidence. Each table is an island of lantern light in
      the surrounding shadow. Here, fences meet brokers, arcane specialists
      network, and information changes hands.

    key_elements:
      - "Tables arranged for confidential conversation"
      - "Exit sightlines from every position"
      - "Lanterns creating private light pools"
      - "Deep shadow between seating areas"

    narrative_moment: |
      The main floor is where the shadow economy operates—not in secret but in
      careful discretion. Every conversation here has stakes. Every exchange is
      calibrated.

  - zone_id: "privacy-islands"
    zone_name: "Privacy Islands"
    zone_type: "detail"

    description: |
      Each table is its own territory, a pool of lantern light surrounded by
      shadow. The spacing ensures conversations don't carry. Patrons lean close
      across dark wood surfaces, their words meant only for each other. Staff
      approach only when summoned, disappear immediately after.

    key_elements:
      - "Individual table as private space"
      - "Lantern casting intimate light"
      - "Two or three patrons leaning close"
      - "Darkness defining boundaries"

  - zone_id: "exit-awareness-zone"
    zone_name: "Exit Sightlines"
    zone_type: "perspective"

    description: |
      From any seat, the exits are visible. This isn't architectural accident but
      deliberate design—every patron can track their escape routes, can notice new
      arrivals, can assess threats before they materialize. The nervous glances
      toward doors are constant, a rhythm of survival instinct.

    key_elements:
      - "Multiple exits visible from seating"
      - "Patron eyes tracking doors"
      - "The architecture of escape"
      - "Constant low-level vigilance"

      quality: "Clear sightlines maintained"

    palette:
      dominant: ["interior shadow", "exit frame visibility"]

    narrative_moment: |
      Exit awareness defines the Silken Siren's culture—everyone is prepared to
      leave quickly, everyone tracks the doors, everyone understands that danger
      could arrive at any moment.

  - zone_id: "exit-watcher"
    zone_name: "Perpetual Vigilance"
    zone_type: "mood"

    description: |
      A patron's eyes flicker toward the entrance as a new figure appears in the
      doorway. The assessment is instant and instinctual—friend, foe, or fellow
      shadow-dweller? The moment passes, conversation resumes, but the vigilance
      never truly relaxes.

    key_elements:
      - "Eyes flickering toward doorway"

    zone_name: "Private Alcoves"
    zone_type: "sanctuary"

    description: |
      For the most sensitive exchanges, alcoves offer enhanced privacy—curtained
      or screened from the main floor, sound-dampened, accessed only by trusted
      clientele or for high-value trades. Here, the really dangerous information
      changes hands, protected by reputation and consequence.

    key_elements:
      - "Screened alcove spaces"
      - "Enhanced sound dampening"

  - zone_id: "private-alcove"
    zone_name: "Private Alcove"
    zone_type: "cell"

    description: |
      Within an alcove, the world shrinks to a table, a lantern, and the face
      across from you. Secrets are spoken here that would never survive the main
      floor. The curtain isn't just fabric—it's a boundary between the careful
      and the committed.

    key_elements:
      - "Single alcove interior"
      - "Table and two or three seats"
      - "Curtain or screen at threshold"

    description: |
      Staff move through the Silken Siren like ghosts—appearing when needed,
      vanishing the moment service is complete. They observe everything and
      acknowledge nothing. Drinks arrive without being ordered, empties disappear
      without interruption. Professional invisibility perfected into art.

    key_elements:
      - "Staff in professional motion"
      - "Observation without acknowledgment"
      - "Service appearing when needed"

  - zone_id: "night-activity"
    zone_name: "Peak Hours"
    zone_type: "temporal"

    description: |
      At peak hours, the Silken Siren fills without crowding. Every table
      occupied but spacing maintained. The hum of hushed conversation creates
      its own privacy—enough noise to cover words, not enough to carry them.
      Business is brisk, stakes are high, and the atmosphere thickens with
      unspoken consequence.

    key_elements:
      - "Full occupancy, maintained spacing"

  - zone_id: "lantern"
    zone_name: "The Glamour-Warded Lantern"
    zone_type: "detail"

    description: |
      The lanterns are more than light sources—rumor has it they're glamour-warded,
      designed to make faces harder to remember, to blur features for those not
      directly across the table. Whether true or not, the effect is real: people
      seen in the Silken Siren are difficult to recall afterward.

    key_elements:
      - "Lantern with possible arcane properties"
      - "Light that blurs memory"
      - "Faces visible but not memorable"
      - "Practical magic for privacy"
