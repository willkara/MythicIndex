creatures:
  - name: Secret Keeper
    description: Shadow-like entities that lurk in the establishment's darkest corners, absorbing conversations and secrets. They don't repeat what they hear but become agitated when dangerous information is spoken, warning regulars that the topic is too hot to handle.
    visual_aspects:
      - Living shadows darker than natural darkness
      - Vaguely humanoid but constantly shifting
      - Multiple ear-like protrusions oriented toward conversations
      - Eyes visible only as darker voids within shadow
      - Movement creates cold drafts and dimming of nearby lights
    habitat:
      where: Darkest corners, under tables, behind furniture
      when: Constantly present; more visible when dangerous topics are discussed
      why: Manifestation of the establishment's culture of secrecy
    behavior:
      who: Multiple entities throughout the establishment
      what: Absorb and protect secrets; warn when topics become dangerous
      how: Become agitated, creating cold spots and shadow movements
    lore: Regulars know to watch the shadows. If they start moving when you speak a name, shut up immediately. That information is protected, probably by the Silent Hand. More than one loose-lipped patron ignored the warning and disappeared within days. The shadows tried to warn them.

  - name: Truth Moth
    description: Pale moths that land on liars during negotiations. They don't detect all lies—only those that would lead to dangerous betrayals or broken deals. Their presence has prevented countless deadly misunderstandings in the shadow economy.
    visual_aspects:
      - Ghostly white moths with unusually large wings
      - Wings bear patterns resembling eyes and masks
      - Completely silent in flight
      - Glow very faintly in darkness
      - Leave powder that tastes bitter on those they mark
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the establishment, especially near negotiation tables
      when: Active during business discussions and information trades
      why: Emerged from collective need for trustworthy shadow dealings
    behavior:
      who: Population of 20-30 moths
      what: Land on those telling dangerous lies during deals
      how: Cannot be fooled; respond to intent to betray, not minor deceptions
    lore: In the shadow economy, a Truth Moth landing means instant loss of reputation. One information broker tried selling false intelligence—moth landed on his hand mid-deal. The buyer walked away. Within a week, the broker couldn't trade anywhere in Waterdeep. Everyone knows: the moths don't lie.

  - name: Exit Wisp
    description: Faint lights that guide patrons to emergency exits when danger arrives. They appear seconds before trouble walks through the door, giving regulars just enough warning to vanish. Have saved countless lives from raids, arrests, and worse.
    visual_aspects:
      - Dim blue-white lights like dying candle flames
      - Move deliberately toward nearest safe exit
      - Pulse more urgently as danger approaches
      - Create thin trails of light showing escape routes
      - Visible only to those the establishment "likes"
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the establishment, dormant until danger approaches
      when: Activate moments before threats arrive
      why: Protection magic of the building or its mysterious owner
    behavior:
      who: Unknown number; appear wherever needed
      what: Warn of incoming danger and guide to safety
      how: Precognitive awareness of approaching threats
    lore: New patrons can't see them—only those the Siren has accepted. During a Watch raid, half the room vanished following wisps while the other half sat confused. Those who followed escaped; those who couldn't see the wisps were arrested. Earning the right to see the wisps is more valuable than any information bought here.

  - name: Price Coin
    description: An enchanted coin used to negotiate information trades. When both parties touch it while stating their price, it grows warm if the deal is fair, cold if it's imbalanced. Prevents exploitation and ensures shadow economy trades remain equitable.
    visual_aspects:
      - Ancient gold coin worn smooth from countless trades
      - No visible markings remain from original minting
      - Temperature shifts based on deal fairness
      - Seems to move on its own, appearing on appropriate tables
      - Feels unusually heavy for its size
    habitat:
      where: Appears on tables where trades are being negotiated
      when: Manifests when serious information trades are discussed
      why: Magical artifact ensuring fair shadow market practices
    behavior:
      who: Single coin, though some claim there are multiple identical ones
      what: Judges fairness of proposed trades through temperature
      how: Unknown magic; seems to evaluate objective value of information
    lore: No one knows who introduced the Price Coin or how it works. It just appears when needed. Try to cheat someone and it grows painfully cold. Offer fair value and it warms pleasantly. Some claim it has opinions—favoring certain types of trades over others. What's certain: deals made with the Price Coin's approval are always honored.
