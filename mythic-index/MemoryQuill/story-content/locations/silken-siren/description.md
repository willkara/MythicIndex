## Psychological Architecture

### Fear as Design Element
The Silken Siren's atmosphere is its security system. The palpable tension, the glances toward exits, the refusal to discuss certain topics—all create an environment where self-policing is automatic. Nobody needs to threaten violence because everyone understands the consequences.

### Trust Calibration
Every interaction calibrates trust. Newcomers are observed. Questions reveal intent. Refusals signal danger. The space teaches its rules through atmosphere rather than signs.
