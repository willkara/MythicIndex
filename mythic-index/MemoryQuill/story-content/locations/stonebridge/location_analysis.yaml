  narrative_soul: |
    Stonebridge is a story about flow—the constant movement of goods, people, 
    and coin across ancient stone that has witnessed centuries of commerce. 
    It's not a place where anyone belongs; it's a place everyone passes through. 
    The town exists in perpetual negotiation: order against chaos, civilization 
    against the river's floods, legitimate trade against shadow dealings in 
    numbered warehouse bays. For travelers like the Company, it's a waypoint 
    where information can be gathered, supplies replenished, and plans adjusted 
    before the road continues.

  transformation_arc: |
    As a waypoint, Stonebridge likely doesn't transform dramatically through the 
    story—it's the constant, the reliable crossroads. What changes is the 
    characters' relationship to it: first arrival (chapter 11), orientation, 
    and departure. The town's consistency is its narrative function—a stable 
    reference point against which the Company's journey can be measured.

  visual_signature: |
    The five-arch bridge dominates—ancient gray stone spanning the Silver Rush 
    with a gentle crown at midspan. The bridge's silhouette against morning mist, 
    with cutwater piers breaking the current, defines Stonebridge's identity. 
    Secondary: the market square's central fountain catching spray in sunlight, 
    surrounded by the grid of awning-shaded stalls. Third: the west-bank crane 
    masts and warehouse rows, working geometry against river water.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Layered commerce sounds: cart wheels grinding cobble beneath market babble, 
    river rush audible through the arches, crane chains clinking and capstans 
    creaking at the docks. Hawkers' calls, gull cries, and the hollow echo when 
    passing beneath the bridge create distinct acoustic zones.
    
  scent_signature: |
    River-fresh at the waterline, shifting to tar and damp timber at the docks. 
    The market square layers bread, spice, leather, livestock, soap and tallow. 
    Near the fountain, cooler air carries spray and the mineral tang of stone.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Cobbles time-smoothed underfoot, radiating summer heat or winter chill. 
    Cool spray near fountain and bridge. Rough hemp rope and tar-textured planks 
    at the docks. The vibration of cart traffic transmitted through stone.

  light_character: |
    Open-sky light dominates the square, softened under guild arcades and 
    market awnings. The bridge casts hard shadows across the river—stripes 
    of dark between sunlit water. Docks receive direct light but crane masts 
    and warehouse eaves create working shade. Dawn and dusk bring river mist 
    that catches low light in golden haze. Night is lantern-post pools along 
    main routes, leaving side alleys dark.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Rain transforms cobbles into mirrors and fills drain rills with rushing 
    water. Mist rolls off the river at dawn/dusk, particularly thick under 
    the bridge arches. Summer heat radiates from stone surfaces. Winter ice 
    scours parapet capstones and requires sand barrels at bridgeheads. Storm 
    conditions force market under arcades and restrict bridge to foot traffic.

contextual_place:
  region: "Sword Coast, along the Trade Way"
  neighborhood_character: |
    A crossroads town—defined by what passes through rather than what stays. 
    The Silver Rush provides the obstacle that makes the bridge valuable; the 
    Trade Way provides the traffic. Surrounding terrain is gently rising banks 
    with low floodplain near docks and firmer terraces at the civic core. 
    The town has grown around the infrastructure of passage.
    
  approach_sequences:
    - name: "From the Trade Way (south approach)"
      description: |
        Road crests a gentle rise, revealing the river valley. The five-arch 
        bridge appears first—gray stone spanning green water, traffic visible 
        crossing. East-bank rooftops and the guild hall row frame the market 
        square beyond. West-bank crane masts and warehouse rows line the quay.

      description: |
        Similar reveal as the road descends toward the river. Bridge dominates 
        the view, with docks visible on the near (west) bank. Market activity 
        suggested by awning colors across the water on the east bank.

    - name: "From the river (approaching by boat)"
      description: |
        The bridge arch openings frame the approach—stone overhead, water 
        rushing through. Quay steps and bollards appear to starboard, crane 
        booms swinging above. The market square is hidden behind the east-bank 
        buildings; only the fountain's spray might be glimpsed through gaps.

  spatial_relationship: |
    Stonebridge sits at a natural crossing point where the Silver Rush is 
    navigable but narrow enough to bridge. The town has grown in response to 
    the infrastructure—east bank for civic/commercial life (market, guilds), 
    west bank for industrial/dock operations. The bridge is spine, not just 
    connection; everything orients around it.

    physical_description: |
      Five semi-circular arches of ancient cut stone span the Silver Rush, 
      each arch 45-55 feet across. The roadway—22-24 feet wide, enough for 
      two carts to pass—rises to a gentle crown at midspan. Dressed-stone 
      parapets stand about four feet high, with pedestrian refuge bays inset 
      every 60-80 feet. Cutwater piers break the current upstream and down. 
      Flood-mark stones are scored into the parapet returns near each abutment. 
      Guard posts with crossbar stores control both bridgeheads.
      
    narrative_function: |
      The bridge is Stonebridge's reason for existing—the chokepoint that 
      makes the town valuable. Crossing it means committing to one bank or 
      the other, passing through guard observation. It's where traffic can 
      be monitored, controlled, or stopped entirely.

    physical_description: |
      A paved square roughly 160 by 110 feet, surfaced with time-smoothed 
      granite and basalt cobbles. The central stone fountain—18 feet across 
      with carved spill-lips—anchors the space. Iron stall anchors are set 
      flush with the paving in a radial grid extending outward from the fountain. 
      Perimeter drains catch runoff at low corners. Two corner shade trees are 
      ringed by low stone seats. Guild arcades line the perimeter, with awning 
      rigging points on facades. Posting boards and permanent scales cluster 
      near the fountain.
      
    narrative_function: |
      The commercial heart of Stonebridge—where goods are displayed, prices 
      negotiated, information exchanged. The fountain is the natural gathering 
      point and reference landmark. This is where the Company would get their 
      bearings, resupply, and potentially gather intelligence.

      and fee tables. Arcade depth is sufficient for small gatherings out of 
      weather. Guild halls proper rise two to three stories above, their 
      windows overlooking the square.

    physical_description: |
      The quay face stretches roughly 320 feet along the river at several 
      stepped levels—upper quay for dry goods, lower steps for waterline work. 
      Timber piles with stone infill support the quay wall, which rises 6-10 
      feet above normal water. Iron bollards mark 25-30 foot intervals; 
      capstan posts anchor two corners. Crane masts—gin and swing-boom types 
      with block-and-tackle—punctuate the waterfront. Strap-rail spurs allow 
      short-haul sleds to move cargo. Warehouse bays (18-22 feet modules) 
      open onto the quay through numbered doors. Tar kettles and ropewalk 
      spools occupy marked pads. Firebreak alleys separate warehouse rows, 
      kept clear for watch patrols. Flood ladders are bolted into quaystone.
      
    narrative_function: |
      Where goods actually move—the working waterfront. Less regulated than 
      the market square, more physical labor, more opportunity for things to

      certain warehouses (Croft's network)" suggests shadow dealings here.

      changes: |
        Flood vigilance dominates. Quay lower steps closed. Flood marks on 
        bridge parapets carefully watched. River running higher and faster. 
        Mist heavier at dawn.
      mood_shift: "Watchful tension around water"
      
    - season: "Summer"
      changes: |
        Additional awnings deployed. Dust damping needed in square. Night 
        markets once a tenday—lanterns throughout the square, extended hours. 
        Heat radiates from stone well into evening.
      mood_shift: "Extended commerce; evening social"
      
    - season: "Autumn"
      changes: |
        Grain convoy season—warehouse overflows. Rope and sail repairs common 
        at docks. Increased cart traffic strains bridge capacity. Harvest 
        goods dominate market stalls.
      mood_shift: "Prosperity under pressure"
      
    - season: "Winter"
      changes: |
        Ice on bridge parapets and cobbles. Sand buckets staged at bridgeheads 
        for traction. Market retracts under guild arcades for shelter. 
        Reduced dock operations in harsh weather. Shorter days concentrate 
        activity.

        The Company arrives, seeing Stonebridge for the first time. Focus on 
        approach, first impressions, finding lodging at Shepherd's Rest, 
        getting bearings in the market square. The town is backdrop for their 
        waypoint tasks.

    - condition: "Rain"
      description: |
        Market retracts under arcades. Cobbles become mirrors. Drain rills 
        rush. Bridge traffic continues but slower. Dock operations proceed 
        but crane work cautious. Indoor spaces (inn common rooms, guild halls) 
        more crowded.
      mood: "Compressed but persistent commerce"
      
    - condition: "Storm"
      description: |
        Awnings furled. Bridge watch restricts heavy carts—may go foot traffic 
        only. Cranes lashed. Market nearly empty. Warehouse shutters barred. 
        Watch patrols minimal.
      mood: "Hunkered and waiting"
      
    - condition: "Mist/Fog"
      description: |
        River mist thickens, particularly under bridge arches. Visibility 
        reduced on docks. Sound carries strangely. Bridge lanterns become 
        halos. More intimate scale to the square.
      mood: "Atmospheric, enclosed feeling"

    target: "The five-arch bridge spanning the Silver Rush, approached from the Trade Way"
    
    rationale: |
      The bridge IS Stonebridge—its reason for existing, its defining feature, 
      its symbolic heart. An establishing shot showing the bridge, with the 
      town visible on both banks, captures the location's essential identity. 
      This is likely the Company's first view as they approach.

    target: "Market square at midday—fountain, stalls, commerce in full flow"
    
    rationale: |
      The market square captures what Stonebridge means in daily life—the 
      fountain as anchor, the stall grid, the press of commerce. This 
      complements the bridge establishing shot by showing the destination, 
      not just the crossing.

    rationale: |
      The west-bank docks represent a different character than the market—
      industrial, physical, with hints of shadow dealings. This provides 
      visual variety and establishes the full scope of Stonebridge's economy.

      pools of lantern light. Provides temporal variety and different

      If the Company features in Stonebridge scenes, this is likely their

      from common room windows—captures the sanctuary aspect of a waypoint

    rationale: |
      The crossing perspective—what you see from the bridge's crown—could 
      serve as a transitional image, capturing the moment between approach 
      and arrival. Shows the bridge as experience, not just structure.
