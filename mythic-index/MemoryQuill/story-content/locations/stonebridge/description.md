# Stonebridge – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Market town straddling the Silver Rush river along the Trade Way, laid across gently rising banks with a low floodplain near the docks and firmer, cobbled terraces closer to the civic core.
- Site Advantages: Central crossing over a strong-flow river; broad approach roads for trade; natural quays along the slower inner bends enable wharf construction; elevated civic square reduces flood risk.
- Environmental Factors: Spring floods and winter ice impose seasonal loading on piers, quays, and paving; summer heat amplifies market dust; river mists at dawn and dusk.
- Approach Routes: Trade Way feeder roads enter from north and south; cart corridors concentrate onto the bridge, then split—east to market/guild halls and west to docks/warehouses. Guard posts monitor bridgehead flows.

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Practical Sword Coast mercantile vernacular—ashlar and fieldstone for civic works, heavy timber framing for warehouses, slate and wood-shingle roofing, iron strapwork at high-load hinges and gates.
- Primary Materials: Ancient cut stone in the bridge piers and arches; dressed stone parapets; cobbled granite/basalt paving in market approaches; timber wharf piles and crane masts; slate roofing on civic buildings; tarred planks and iron fittings at docks.
- Construction Methods: Five-span masonry arch bridge with cutwater piers; parapet walls and pedestrian refuges inset into spandrels; cobbles laid on lime-stabilized bedding with drainage scuppers; quay walls founded on driven piles with timber walers; warehouse bays on heavy posts with tie beams and truss roofs.
- Overall Layout: The bridge is the spine. East bank holds the market square, fountain, and guild hall row; west bank concentrates docks, warehouses, and cranes. Inn and lodging (Shepherd’s Rest) sit one street off the square to reduce noise, with lanes radiating to residential rows.

## Detailed Structural Analysis

### The Stone Bridge (Five Arches, Ancient Work)
- Dimensions & Scale: Five semi-circular arches; typical span 45–55 ft each; roadway width ~22–24 ft—two carts can pass with pedestrian squeeze; parapet height ~4 ft.
- Construction Details: Cut-stone voussoirs with tight lime joints; piers with upstream/downstream cutwaters; scuppers through spandrels drain the cambered roadway; refuges inset every 60–80 ft for foot traffic.
- Layout Configuration: Central arch clears the deepest channel; incremental ramps from both banks produce a mild crown at midspan; toll niches and guard bays at both bridgeheads.
- Distinctive Features: Flood-mark stones scored into parapet returns; iron mooring rings near the abutments (historic use during low traffic).
- Physical Condition: Weathered but serviceable; parapet capstones show winter ice scouring; periodic repointing visible on downstream faces. Canon note: five arches (chapter-verified), superseding prior three-arch mention.

### Market Square and Guild Hall Row (East Bank)
- Dimensions & Scale: Paved square roughly 160 x 110 ft; central stone fountain cistern ~18 ft diameter with carved spill-lips.
- Construction Details: Granite/basalt cobbles with lime-sand bedding; perimeter drains at low corners; iron stall anchors set flush with paving; guild halls of dressed stone with slate roofs and arcaded frontages.
- Layout Configuration: Stall rows orient radially from fountain outward to arcades; delivery lanes at square’s perimeter; awning rigging points on guild facades.
- Distinctive Features: Posting boards under arcades; permanent scales near fountain; shade trees in two corners ringed by low stone seats.
- Physical Condition: Cobbles time-smoothed; localized rutting on cart edges; fountain shows hard-water staining and seasonal algae.

### Docks, Quays, and Warehouse Front (West Bank)
- Dimensions & Scale: Quay face length ~320 ft across several stepped levels; quay wall height 6–10 ft above normal river; warehouse bay modules ~18–22 ft.
- Construction Details: Timber piles with stone infill facings; bollards at 25–30 ft intervals; capstan posts at two corners; crane masts (gin and swing-boom types) with block-and-tackle sets; strap-rail spurs for short-haul sleds.
- Layout Configuration: Upper quay for dry goods; lower steps for waterline work; firebreak alleys between warehouse rows; watch lane separated from cart path by timber curbs.
- Distinctive Features: Tar kettles and ropewalk spools; numbered bay doors; flood ladders bolted into quaystone.
- Physical Condition: Tar-stained planks with worn tread; warehouse door ironwork polished by use; evidence of illicit extra bay locking hardware at certain warehouses (Croft’s network).

### Shepherd’s Rest and Adjacent Streets
- Dimensions & Scale: Inn footprint ~50 x 35 ft; two stories plus attic with dormers; interior courtyard service lane.
- Construction Details: Timber frame on stone plinth; slate roof; corner braces and strap hinges; window shutters fitted with storm bars.
- Layout Configuration: Common room on street front; kitchen and scullery at rear; lodging above; stabling in lane-side lean-to.
- Distinctive Features: Lantern post at corner; painted signboard facing the market approach; rain barrel chain off eave into cistern.
- Physical Condition: Well-kept; recent roof slate replacements visible; lintel carved with date of refurbishment.

### Civic Lanes, Alleys, and Minor Works
- Paving transitions to mixed cobble/packed earth beyond square; drain rills to side gutters; night-lantern posts at intersections; guard posts at bridgeheads with crossbar stores for crowd control.

## Physical Systems & Infrastructure

### Structural Engineering
- Foundation Systems: Bridge piers keyed into riverbed with sacrificial stone footings; quay wall piles tied with walers; guild hall row on shallow spread footings atop compacted fill.
- Load-Bearing Elements: Masonry arches transfer thrust to piers; timber trusses carry warehouse roofs; tie-rods in longer spans.
- Roofing Systems: Slate over battens; timber trusses (queen/king post variants) at warehouses; rain leaders discharge to street rills.
- Connections & Joints: Iron dogs and straps at timber joints; dressed stone pins and lime mortar joints in civic masonry.

### Environmental Controls
- Heating & Ventilation: Natural cross-ventilation in market arcades; warehouse vent windows under eaves; hearths in inns and guild halls.
- Lighting Systems: Daylight dominates square; night by oil lantern posts; dock lamps shielded to reduce glare on water.
- Water Management: Fountain fed by upstream intake and gravity head; street rills and scuppers drain to river; quay steps allow controlled overtop access during minor floods.
- Climate Protection: Removable flood shutters for certain bay doors; awning frames in square; ice-sanding barrels stored at bridgeheads.

### Security & Access
- Entry Control: Guard posts at both bridgeheads; temporary crossbars for crowd control; watch patrols along quays at dusk.
- Observation Points: Parapet refuges double as watch holdfasts; guild arcade overlooks square; crane perches offer high views.
