    A river-straddling trade hub defined by its ancient five-arch stone bridge over
    the Silver Rush, a paved market square with guild arcades and central fountain,
    and busy west-bank docks lined with warehouses and cranes. The town's civic stonework
    shows centuries of maintenance against flood, ice, and constant commerce. This is
    where honest trade meets shadowed dealing, where justice struggles against corruption,
    and where the Company proves their worth through a heist that delivers evidence
    the law cannot gather.

# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Essential Truth of This Place
# ============================================================================

narrative_soul: |
  Stonebridge lives up to its name—the ancient five-arch bridge is the town's spine,
  connecting east-bank markets and guild halls to west-bank docks and warehouses.
  Commerce flows constantly: carts cross the bridge, stalls fill the market square,
  cranes swing cargo at the quay. But beneath the honest bustle runs a darker current.

  When the Company arrives, they find a magistrate bone-tired from fighting losing
  battles, a clerk whose conscience finds cracks in corruption's walls, and evidence
  locked in warehouses that serve shadowed masters. Justice cannot work openly here,
  so justice works through shadows—a heist that delivers what the law cannot gather,
  a controlled burn that reveals what corruption tries to hide.

      The five-arch stone bridge is Stonebridge's defining feature—ancient masonry
      spanning the Silver Rush with semi-circular arches, upstream cutwaters on each

      Beneath the bridge arches, the world changes—hollow echo replacing

      At night, the bridge transforms—torch posts casting pools of light along
      the parapet, guards at bridgeheads controlling flow, the river black
      beneath. During incidents, crossbars narrow passage to single lanes.
      The bridge becomes a controlled threshold between town halves.

      When tolls are enforced, a niche at the bridgehead serves collection—

      granite cobbles, stalls radiating from the central fountain, guild arcades

      When rain comes, the market transforms—awnings extended or furled,
      cobbles slick and streaming, customers clustering under arcades,
      fountain spray mixing with falling water. The commerce doesn't stop
      but contracts, retreating to shelter while goods stay covered.

      slate roofs, arcaded frontages providing shelter for transactions.
      Posting boards display notices. Permanent scales stand for official
      weighing. The arcades are where commerce meets bureaucracy, where
