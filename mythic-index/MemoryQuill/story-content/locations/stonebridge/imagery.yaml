    The town exists in perpetual negotiation: order against chaos, civilization\

    supplies replenished, and plans adjusted before the road continues.\n"

    and the guild hall row's dressed-stone facades under slate roofs. The west\ 

    bank shows crane masts and warehouse rows, working geometry against water.\

            2. FANTASY TONE: This is a high-fantasy world (D&D / Faerûn vibe). Include subtle magical infrastructure (runes, enchanted lanterns, ward-stones, guild sigils) where appropriate.

            3. NO FACE CLONING: If people appear, keep them generic and varied—do not repeat an identical face across images unless explicitly required.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            SCENARIO: central stone fountain approximately 18ft diameter, carved spill-lips with water spray catching light, radial stall arrangement extending from fountain, canvas awnings in reds and ochres, time-smoothed granite and basalt cobbles, iron stall anchors visible flush with paving, guild arcades with dressed stone at perimeter, shade trees in corners with stone seats, active commerce: vendors, customers, porters, posting boards visible under arcade, five semi-circular stone arches spanning the Silver Rush, cutwater piers breaking the current upstream and downstream, dressed-stone parapets with pedestrian refuge bays, flood-mark stones scored into parapet returns, central stone fountain with carved spill-lips, iron stall anchors flush with market cobbles, crane masts with block-and-tackle at the west-bank quay, numbered warehouse bay doors, guild arcades with posting boards framing the square, runic keystones and ward-stones set into the bridge arches (safety magic), everburning lamp-niches at intervals along the span (storm-safe light), toll plaques with guild sigils and anti-forgery marks (alchemical ink), The eighteen-foot stone fountain dominates the composition, water arcing from carved spill-lips and catching midday sun in prismatic spray. The stall grid radiates outward from this anchor, canvas awnings in reds and ochres providing shade over displayed goods— bolts of cloth, stacked produce, hanging metalwork. Vendors call and gesture, customers examine wares, porters navigate between stalls with loaded baskets. The time-smoothed cobbles of granite and basalt show centuries of foot traffic. Guild arcades frame the square's edges, dressed stone and slate roofs providing permanent backdrop to the temporary stalls. Iron stall anchors glint between cobbles. Corner shade trees offer respite, low stone seats occupied by those taking a moment from commerce., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: This is where the Company would orient themselves after crossing the bridge—the civic heart where supplies can be found, information gathered, and the town's character assessed. The fountain as landmark, the stalls as opportunity, the arcades as shelter., Medium-wide shot from arcade edge or elevated position at one corner. Fountain as clear focal point, centered or strong left third. Stall rows creating recession toward opposite arcade. Enough height to show awning patterns but close enough to see individual faces and goods. Activity throughout—no empty zones. Guild facade visible beyond awnings establishing permanent architecture., midday, fair, bright, light from overhead midday sun, bright but not harsh, awning-softened in stalls, high overhead with slight angle, neutral to warm tones, moderate, dappled under awnings shadows, fountain spray creating micro-rainbows, dominant colors: gray and charcoal cobbles, cream and gray stone, canvas cream awnings; accent colors: awning reds and ochres, colorful goods on display, fountain spray white and prismatic, green foliage at corners, high fantasy, celebratory atmosphere, materials: ancient cut stone arches, dressed limestone parapets, lime mortar joints, time-smoothed granite and basalt cobbles, lime-sand bedding, hea...

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            - character portraits (identity references)

            - a location overview (environment reference)

            - style references (art direction)


            Generate a NEW scene matching the scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Avoid “real-world medieval Europe” drift; keep fantasy species variety and magical infrastructure plausible and grounded-in-world (not neon).

            5. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.


            SCENARIO: dressed-stone parapet in foreground, worn capstones suggesting age, roadway descending toward east bridgehead, guard post visible at bridgehead, guild hall facades beyond bridge, market approach visible between buildings, fountain spray glimpsed through gap, pedestrian refuge bay with figure, sense of river below (sound, glimpsed foam), five semi-circular stone arches spanning the Silver Rush, cutwater piers breaking the current upstream and downstream, dressed-stone parapets with pedestrian refuge bays, flood-mark stones scored into parapet returns, central stone fountain with carved spill-lips, iron stall anchors flush with market cobbles, crane masts with block-and-tackle at the west-bank quay, numbered warehouse bay doors, guild arcades with posting boards framing the square, runic keystones and ward-stones set into the bridge arches (safety magic), everburning lamp-niches at intervals along the span (storm-safe light), toll plaques with guild sigils and anti-forgery marks (alchemical ink), First-person perspective from bridge midspan, looking toward the east bank. The dressed-stone parapet occupies the near foreground, its capstones worn smooth by countless hands. The roadway descends gently toward the east bridgehead, where a guard post and lantern bracket mark the transition to town. Beyond, the guild hall row frames the market approach—dressed stone facades under slate roofs, arcade shadows beneath. A glimpse of the fountain's spray catches light through the gap. Morning sun warms the stone ahead. The river is heard more than seen from this angle—rushing through the arches below, foam visible at the downstream cutwater. A pedestrian refuge bay is visible in the parapet to one side, a figure resting there. The sense of arriving at a destination earned., Faerûn high-fantasy interior cues (subtle, believable magic): enchanted lanterns/sconces, rune-inlaid beams, warding motifs worked into stone and metal, arcane guild seals and sigils as functional infrastructure, First-person or over-shoulder perspective from bridge crown. Parapet as strong foreground element establishing POV. Middle ground: bridge roadway descending, bridgehead guard post. Background: east bank town—guild facades framing market approach, fountain spray visible. Strong sense of depth and forward motion toward destination., morning, fair, clear, light from morning sun from east (ahead), warm, inviting, welcoming, front-lighting the destination, warm gold tones, minimal—destination lit shadows, clear morning air, dominant colors: warm limestone and gray stone, soft sky blue, guild facade cream; accent colors: market awning colors beyond, fountain spray white, green glimpses of shade trees, high fantasy, pastoral atmosphere, materials: ancient cut stone arches, dressed limestone parapets, lime mortar joints, time-smoothed granite and basalt cobbles, lime-sand bedding, heavy oak framing, tarred wharf planks, crane masts, Mood intent: The promise of arrival—seeing the destination laid out before you after journey. The pastoral mood captures hope, the natural progression toward rest and resupply, the town as welcoming prospect.
