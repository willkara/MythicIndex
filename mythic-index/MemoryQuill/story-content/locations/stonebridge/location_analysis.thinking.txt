This is a comprehensive location analysis request for Stonebridge, a market town and river crossing in a fantasy setting. The user has provided three files:
1. Overview - basic information, quick description, visual summary
2. Description - detailed physical description, systems, sensory environment
3. Inhabitants - demographics, space usage, operational rhythms

I need to analyze this location through the Five Dimensions of Place framework and produce the structured YAML output. Let me work through this systematically.

## Step 1: Extract Physical Truth

From the description file:
- **Architectural DNA**: Sword Coast mercantile vernacular - ashlar/fieldstone for civic works, heavy timber for warehouses, slate/wood-shingle roofing, iron strapwork
- **Primary Materials**: Ancient cut stone bridge, dressed stone parapets, granite/basalt cobbles, timber wharf piles, slate roofing, tarred planks, iron fittings
- **Scale**: Five-arch bridge (45-55ft spans, 22-24ft wide), market square ~160x110ft, 18ft fountain, 320ft quay face
- **Sensory Signature**: 
  - Visual: Five-arch bridge, fountain mist, stacked crates, crane booms, guild arcades
  - Sound: Market babble, river rush, cart wheels on cobble, hawkers, gulls
  - Smell: River freshness, tar, bread/spice/leather, soap/tallow
  - Tactile: Cool spray by fountain, heat radiating from cobbles

**Canon Details** to capture:
- Five-arch bridge (explicitly noted as "chapter-verified")
- Flood-mark stones on bridge parapet returns
- Pedestrian refuge bays inset in bridge
- Central stone fountain cistern ~18ft diameter
- Iron stall anchors flush with market cobbles
- Bollard-spaced quay edge with flood ladders
- Numbered warehouse bay doors
- Tar kettles and ropewalk spools at docks


- Shepherd's Rest inn nestled just off the main market square, offering a quiet retreat from the bustling commercial hub.

## Step 2: Identify Narrative Soul

From overview:
- First appearance: Chapter 11
- Significance: Moderate
- Type: Market town and river crossing - a hub of commerce and transit

The narrative soul emerges as a complex interplay of movement and exchange. It's a place defined by constant negotiation - between merchants and travelers, civilization and natural forces, order and potential chaos. The infrastructure tells a story of resilience: bridges that withstand floods, market systems that regulate trade, and hidden networks that operate beneath the surface of apparent normalcy.

This is fundamentally a place of TRANSACTION - where goods, people, and information flow like the river itself, creating a dynamic ecosystem of commerce and connection.

passing through this crossroads, understanding it as more than just a geographical point. For the Company, it represents a strategic waypoint - a location for resupply, intelligence gathering, and momentary respite from their journey.

## Step 3: Map Character-Space Relationships

The town's spatial dynamics suggest transient interactions. The Company would likely inhabit Shepherd's Rest, using it as a temporary base to observe, rest, and prepare. Their movements would trace the rhythms of the market square and docks, always alert, always in motion.

## Step 4: Catalog Temporal States

The town pulses with cyclical energy - from morning market preparations to evening wind-down, each phase marked by distinct rhythms of activity and rest.

## Step 5: Contextualize in World

Situated along the Sword Coast's Trade Way, this location emerges as a critical nexus. Bounded by the Silver Rush river and connected by ancient roads, it serves as a critical junction for travelers and merchants alike.

## Zone Analysis

Two critical zones define this space: the Five-Arch Stone Bridge as a controlled threshold, and the Market Square as a vibrant commons. Each represents a different mode of interaction - one of regulation, the other of exchange.

The town's zones reveal intricate social dynamics:
- Guild Hall Row blends administrative and commercial functions
- Docks represent transformation through physical labor
- Shepherd's Rest offers temporary sanctuary
- Bridgeheads manage critical boundaries

The narrative essence centers on flow - commerce, people, goods, and information moving through interconnected spaces. The stone bridge symbolizes this constant movement, a living artery of exchange and connection.

Where commerce intersects with natural forces, tension emerges between structured civilization and unpredictable chaos. The bridge becomes a metaphorical and literal threshold - a place of transition where controlled human activity confronts the river's raw, uncontrolled energy.

Recommended visual perspectives capture this dynamic: a misty morning bridge scene, bustling market square, and working waterfront docks revealing the complex interactions of human order and environmental flux.
