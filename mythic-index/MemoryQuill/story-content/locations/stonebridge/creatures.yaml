creatures:
  - name: Bridge Troll (Benign)
    description: Not a traditional troll but a small earth elemental that lives in the bridge's foundations. It repairs mortar, clears drainage channels, and alerts engineers to structural problems. The bridge has stood for centuries largely due to its tireless maintenance.
    visual_aspects:
      - Vaguely humanoid form about 3 feet tall made of stone and mortar
      - Moss and lichen grow on its shoulders and head
      - Moves slowly with grinding stone sounds
      - Eyes like polished river stones set in rough-hewn face
      - Hands constantly work—smoothing, filling, arranging
    habitat:
      where: Within the bridge structure itself, especially foundation arches
      when: Most active during low water when it can access piers
      why: Bonded to the bridge during original construction centuries ago
    behavior:
      who: Single ancient entity devoted to bridge maintenance
      what: Repairs damage, clears blockages, monitors structural integrity
      how: Can merge with stone to move through structure; secretes bonding compound
    lore: Local legend says a master mason trapped his own spirit in the bridge to ensure it would last forever. More likely it's an earth elemental bound during construction. Either way, it's saved the bridge from countless floods and foundation failures. Engineers leave offerings of quality mortar and iron—which it incorporates into repairs.

  - name: Market Sparrow
    description: Unusually intelligent sparrows that track market prices through observation. They chirp in patterns that experienced traders can interpret, providing real-time price information. They've become an unofficial but trusted market indicator.
    visual_aspects:
      - Slightly larger than normal sparrows with bright, alert eyes
      - Plumage patterns seem to shift based on market conditions
      - Constantly hopping between merchant stalls
      - Chirp in complex, musical patterns
      - Form flocks that swirl over particularly good deals
    habitat:
      where: Market square and surrounding commercial areas
      when: Active during market hours; rest when commerce stops
      why: Emerged from centuries of market activity and commerce magic
    behavior:
      who: Flock of 50-100 working cooperatively
      what: Monitor prices, signal good deals, warn of scams
      how: Observe transactions and communicate through chirp patterns
    lore: Veteran traders won't make major purchases without checking the sparrows. Their chirp patterns indicate fair prices, overcharging, and quality. A sudden sparrow swarm means an exceptional deal. Silence means something's wrong. One merchant tried using weighted scales—sparrows created such a racket that everyone noticed. His reputation never recovered.

  - name: Fountain Spirit
    description: A water elemental residing in the market square's central fountain. It's considered good luck to toss coins and make wishes. The spirit doesn't grant wishes, but it does create beautiful water displays and occasionally helps lost children find their parents.
    visual_aspects:
      - Occasionally visible as face or figure in fountain spray
      - Creates impossible water patterns—arches, spirals, sculptures
      - Reflects rainbow light through mist on sunny days
      - Sometimes produces gentle spray toward overheated market-goers
      - Pulls coins to fountain bottom in neat, organized patterns
    habitat:
      where: The central market fountain
      when: Most active during busy market days
      why: Bound to fountain during construction; serves the community
    behavior:
      who: Single ancient elemental, possibly hundreds of years old
      what: Creates water displays, helps lost children, provides cooling spray
      how: Controls fountain water with precision and apparent intelligence
    lore: Every child in Stonebridge knows: if you're lost in the market, go to the fountain and ask for help. The spirit will create a water arc pointing toward the nearest adult who's looking for a child. It's reunited hundreds of families. Wishes don't come true, but the spirit seems to remember regular wishers—greeting them with special displays.

  - name: Dock Rat King
    description: Not a literal rat king but a supernatural collective of wharf rats that share knowledge and coordinate actions. They control vermin populations, alert dockworkers to cargo hazards, and seem to understand shipping schedules better than most clerks.
    visual_aspects:
      - Large, healthy rats with unusual coordination
      - Move in precise formations like trained soldiers
      - Eyes reflect light with unusual intelligence
      - Some bear scars showing long lives and experience
      - Create complex patterns with their movements—almost like writing
    habitat:
      where: Wharf warehouses and dock areas
      when: Most active during cargo operations
      why: Collective intelligence emerged from generations of dock rats
    behavior:
      who: Hundreds of individuals sharing collective awareness
      what: Manage pest populations, inspect cargo, warn of hazards
      how: Coordinate perfectly; seem to share sensory information
    lore: Dockworkers have learned to read the rats. Rats fleeing a warehouse means fire or structural danger. Rats gathering near specific cargo means spoilage or contamination. They've saved lives and fortunes. One dock master swears they understand shipping manifests—he left one unattended and returned to find rats had "corrected" an error by moving manifest markers. The correction was accurate.
