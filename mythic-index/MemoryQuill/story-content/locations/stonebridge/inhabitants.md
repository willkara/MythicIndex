- Through-Flow: Seasonal caravans, riverboats’ crews, and itinerant merchants swell counts by 10–30% on busy days.

## Space Usage

- Five-Arch Stone Bridge (Central Spine)
  - Who: Carters/teamsters (two-way passage), pedestrians; guard post at each bridgehead.
  - Use: Continuous movement; temporary queue control with crossbars during surges; pedestrian refuges used by foot traffic and lookouts.
  - Capacity/Flow: Two laden carts can pass; pinch points at abutments managed by guards.

- Market Square (East Bank)
  - Who: Stallholders, porters, customers; guild clerks under arcades; water-fetchers at fountain; town crier at posting board.
  - Use: Stall grid anchors used for rigging; perimeter lanes for cart ingress/egress; scales and inspection near fountain.
  - Capacity/Flow: 140–220 stalls on full market days; circulation kept open along perimeter and to fountain.

- Guild Hall Row and Arcades (East Bank Perimeter)
  - Who: Guild officers and clerks; petitioners; scribes; messengers.
  - Use: Arcades provide sheltered transaction space; awning rigging points; posting boards and fee tables.
  - Capacity/Flow: 60–100 people under arcades at peak; spillover manages weather shifts.

- Docks, Quays, and Warehouse Front (West Bank)
  - Who: Dockhands; crane crews; tally clerks; carters; watch lane patrol.
  - Use: Upper quay for dry goods staging; lower steps for waterline work; firebreak alleys between warehouse rows; strap-rail spurs for short-haul sleds.
  - Capacity/Flow: 3–6 mooring operations concurrently along ~320 ft quay; bollards at ~25–30 ft intervals; capstans at corners.

- Warehouse Bays and Firebreak Alleys (West Bank)
  - Who: Warehouse crews; tally and seal checks; guards on watch lane.
  - Use: Bay doors numbered; dunnage and tar kettles at set pads; flood ladders bolted into quaystone; illicit extra-lock hardware occasionally noted (subject to seizure).
  - Capacity/Flow: 1–2 carts per bay; alleyways kept clear for fire and watch passage.

- Shepherd’s Rest and Adjacent Streets (One street off square)
  - Who: Inn staff; lodgers (merchants, Company, travelers); stablehands at lean-to.
  - Use: Common room frontage to street; service lane to stabling; rain-barrel chain to cistern; signboard visibility to square approach.
  - Capacity/Flow: 30–60 lodgers typical; coach/wagon staging limited to frontage; overflow to nearby lanes.

- Guard Posts and Roving Patrols
  - Who: Town guard at both bridgeheads; roving quay patrol; market rovers.
  - Use: Crowd and flow regulation; toll queue control (if enforced); incident response; closure crossbars at bridge during security events.
  - Capacity/Flow: 6–10 guards per bridgehead at peak; 6–12 across docks; 4–8 in square; roving pairs circulate continuously.

## Operational Rhythms
- Morning (dawn–midmorning)
  - Stall rigging; fountain bucket lines; first wagons crest the bridge; quay gearing-up; tally boards posted.
  - Guard posts relieve night watch; market crier calls notices; inns offload breakfast traffic to square.

- Midday (late morning–afternoon)
  - Peak density in square and on bridge; cranes swing loads; strap-rail spurs clatter; guild arcades at capacity.
  - Guard increases presence at bridgeheads to maintain two-cart flow; scales and inspections concentrate by fountain.

- Evening (late afternoon–twilight)
  - Stall breaking-down and cart loading in square; quay steps quiet to priority cargo; inns swell; lantern posts lit.
  - Bridge pedestrian share rises; guards manage mixed foot/cart flow; patrols shift toward dockside alleys.

- Night (after full dark)
  - Bridge narrows to a controlled lane during incidents; quay operations reduced; warehouse bays shuttered.
  - Watch patrols increase along firebreak alleys; arcades cleared; fountain maintenance or lamp refill work.

## Notes
- Circulation is the constraint: perimeter lanes of the market and bridge approaches must remain open; guard crossbars and bollards regulate choke points.
- Flood/ice response: parapet flood marks guide closures; quay steps and lower platforms closed first; market retracts under arcades in winter weather.
- Fire safety: firebreak alleys and watch lanes remain clear; tar kettles restricted to marked pads on the quay; bucket chains directed from fountain side.
