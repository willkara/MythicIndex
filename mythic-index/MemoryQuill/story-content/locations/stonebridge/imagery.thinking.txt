This is a comprehensive request for location art direction for Stonebridge. Let me analyze the input and create a detailed imagery.yaml file following the Location Art Director role specifications.

Key elements from the analysis:
1. **Location Identity**: A market town built around a five-arch stone bridge over the Silver Rush river
2. **Narrative Soul**: Flow, commerce, passage - a waypoint, not a destination
3. **Core Visual Elements**:
   - Five-arch bridge (CRITICAL: not three)
   - Market square with 18ft fountain
   - West-bank docks with cranes and warehouses
   - Shepherd's Rest inn
   - Guild arcades

**Visual Anchor Elements**:
- Five semi-circular stone arches
- Cutwater piers
- Flood-mark stones on parapets
- Pedestrian refuge bays
- Central fountain with carved spill-lips
- Iron stall anchors flush with cobbles
- Crane masts with block-and-tackle
- Numbered warehouse bay doors
- Slate roofs on guild buildings
- Timber frame inn with lantern post

**Recommended Images from Analysis**:
1. ESTABLISHING (primary): Five-arch bridge from Trade Way approach
2. ESSENCE (primary): Market square at midday with fountain
3. ZONE (secondary): Docks and quay
4. TEMPORAL (secondary): Bridge at evening/night
5. INHABITED (secondary): Shepherd's Rest at evening
6. PERSPECTIVE (optional): View from bridge midspan
7. TEMPORAL (optional): Market square in rain

Let me create the full imagery.yaml following the format specifications.

Mood selections based on analysis recommendations and zone affinities:
- Establishing (bridge approach): PASTORAL - soft morning light, arrival feeling, hope
- Essence (market square): CELEBRATORY - warm commerce, bustling life, convivial energy
- Docks zone: KINETIC - industrial activity, movement, energy
- Bridge at night: SOMBER - quieter, watchful, ancient stone in darkness


- Shepherd's Rest: INTIMATE - refuge, warmth, single light source
- Bridge perspective: PASTORAL - the promise of arrival
- Market in rain: SOMBER - contracted commerce, reflective surfaces

I'll develop a comprehensive visual narrative that captures the town's essence, focusing on the interplay of light, movement, and architectural character. The mood progression will guide viewers through Stonebridge's layered emotional landscape, from hopeful arrival to intimate refuge.
