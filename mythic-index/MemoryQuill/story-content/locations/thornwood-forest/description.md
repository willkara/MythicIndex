# Thornwood Forest – Physical Description

## Geography & Terrain
- **Massing & Canopy**: Dense stands of old-growth trees create deep shadow corridors and a ceiling that swallows sunlight. Branches interlock and break long sightlines, turning even midday into twilight under certain weather.
- **Forest Floor**: A layered carpet of damp leaves, needles, and root-webs; treacherous in darkness and worse in thaw, when mud hides holes and the ground gives way without warning.
- **Hollows & Cover**: Hidden depressions, fallen logs, and brush walls create natural blind corners—perfect for ambush, concealment, or simply getting lost.
- **Water**: Clear streams and seeps thread through the wood, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth; in winter they ice over into deceptive crossings.

## Seasonal Character
### Winter: The Hushed Cathedral
- Snow-laden boughs turn the canopy into a white ceiling; branches crack under weight.
- Sound dampens into an eerie quiet broken by the occasional snap of ice or the sudden rush of startled wings.
- Exposure becomes lethal fast; wind seeks every seam in clothing, and stillness steals heat.

### Spring Thaw: The Mud Labyrinth
- The ground becomes a quagmire that grabs boots and hooves; paths widen into churned channels.
- Air thickens with damp earth and decay-sweet leaf rot; fog collects in low hollows at dawn.
- Trails shift as water reroutes; landmarks become the only reliable navigation.

## Built Remnants & Human Impact
- **Old Work**: Ruins and old stonework (collapsed foundations, broken walls, hidden pits) appear without warning where the forest has reclaimed them.
- **Modern Intrusions**: Patrol traces, tripwires, and manufactured “natural” obstacles near hostile operations; signs are subtle and meant to read as ordinary wilderness.

## Hazards
- **Terrain**: Concealed pits, slick roots, ice crusts over soft snow, sudden drop-offs in hollows.
- **Weather**: Blizzard conditions that erase trails; sudden rain that turns creeks into barriers.
- **Threats**: Predators and displaced wildlife; organized hostile patrols and watchers where the forest borders enemy territory.

## Sensory Environment
- **Smell**: Pine resin, wet bark, mineral cold from streams; in thaw, rich rot and mushroom-earth; near hostile sites, a faint metallic tang of ozone or wrongness.
- **Sound**: Wind in high branches; distant bird calls; the small, loud noises of a party moving through brush; sudden, coordinated silences when predators or patrols are near.
- **Light**: Dappled and unreliable—bright shafts one moment, swallowed shadow the next.

## Arc-Specific Alterations (Silent Hand)
- **Contamination**: Areas near the facility feel "wrong"—water carries a magical suppression signature, and the forest feels hostile, as if observing intruders with intelligence rather than instinct.
