Let me analyze the Thornwood Forest location based on the provided documentation. This is a wilderness location that serves as an important setting for travel and mission scenes.

Key elements to capture:

**Physical Truth:**
- Ancient, dense old-growth forest
- Deep shadow corridors, interlocking branches breaking sightlines
- Layered floor of leaves, needles, root-webs
- Hidden hollows, fallen logs, brush walls
- Clear streams and seeps
- Two seasonal states: winter (snow cathedral) and spring thaw (mud labyrinth)
- Ruins and old stonework reclaimed by forest

**Narrative Soul:**
- Nature's indifference - beauty and danger braided together
- The world outside city law
- A barometer for unnatural corruption
- Search-and-rescue terrain
- Infiltration corridor near Silent Hand operations
- The forest feels "watchful" and near hostile areas feels "contaminated" or "wrong"

**Character-Space Relationships:**
- This is clearly Veyra's domain - she's a tracker/ranger
- The Company travels through here on missions
- Wildlife as a "system" that reacts to intrusion

**Temporal States:**
- Winter: hushed cathedral, lethal cold, snow-laden boughs, eerie quiet
- Spring: mud labyrinth, fog, decay-sweet air, shifting trails
- Time of day matters greatly - midday can be twilight under canopy

**Key Zones:**
- Deep wood (Heart of the forest)
- Edge territories (Threshold - where settlements skirt)
- Streams and water crossings (Liminal)
- Rocky outcrops for overwatch (Perimeter/tactical)
- Hidden hollows (Sanctuary or danger)
- Ruins (Forge of the past/danger)
- Contaminated zones near Silent Hand (Corrupted/liminal)

**Visual Opportunities:**
1. Establishing shot - the forest as cathedral/labyrinth
2. Seasonal variations - winter vs. 

I'll expand the visual narrative, exploring the forest's dynamic landscape and sensory complexity. The seasonal transitions reveal the forest's transformative nature - from winter's crystalline stillness to spring's muddy, organic rebirth. Each phase presents unique challenges and atmospheric shifts. Wildlife becomes a living barometer, signaling subtle changes in terrain and potential threats. The forest's watchful essence emerges through intricate light patterns, sound textures, and the constant interplay between concealment and revelation.
