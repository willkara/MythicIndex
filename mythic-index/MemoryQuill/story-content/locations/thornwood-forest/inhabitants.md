# Thornwood Forest – Inhabitants & Presence

## Wildlife
- **Common**: Rabbits, foxes, squirrels, badgers, winter birds, and ravens.
- **Behavioral Note**: The Thornwood’s animals often react as a “single system” to disruption—flurries of movement, warning calls, and sudden silence that can feel coordinated. Near the Silent Hand facility, wildlife is notably agitated or unnaturally absent.

## People
- **Locals & Travelers**: Villagers from nearby settlements skirt the edge for wood, forage, and short cuts—rarely the deep wood.
- **Trackers & Rangers**: Those with true Thornwood knowledge follow game trails and ridge spines, avoiding hollows and ruin ground.

## Hostile Presence (Silent Hand Arc)
- **Patrols & Watchers**: Hidden sentries, tripwires, and controlled movement corridors designed to steer intruders into predictable approaches.
