  generation_notes: |
    An ancient, dense forest north of Waterdeep that serves as wilderness backdrop,
    infiltration corridor, and barometer for unnatural corruption. The Thornwood swallows
    travelers in a dozen steps—old-growth trees creating deep shadow corridors, hidden
    hollows breaking sightlines, seasonal extremes turning the forest into either a
    hushed winter cathedral or a spring mud labyrinth. Near the Silent Hand facility,
    the forest feels actively hostile, observing intruders with intelligence rather
    than instinct.

# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Essential Truth of This Place

narrative_soul: |
  The Thornwood is old and it watches. Ancient trees packed tight create shadow
  corridors where even midday becomes twilight. Hidden hollows and brush walls
  break sightlines every few yards. Wildlife moves as a coordinated system—
  warning calls, sudden silences, eruptions of flight that signal something wrong.

  In winter, snow-laden boughs transform the forest into a hushed cathedral where
  sound dampens to eerie quiet and exposure becomes lethal. In spring thaw, the
  ground becomes a labyrinth of mud and fog. Near the Silent Hand's territory,
  the forest feels contaminated—water carrying suppression signatures, the very
  trees seeming to observe intruders with malevolent attention.

  This is where Vera was found, protected by animals that shouldn't care. Where
  the reconnaissance team realized they were being herded. Where Lyra emerged
  from shadows to prove she was both asset and predator. The forest doesn't judge—
  it simply reveals what you bring into it.
