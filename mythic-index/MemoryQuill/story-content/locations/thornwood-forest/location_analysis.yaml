  narrative_soul: |
    The Thornwood is nature stripped of comfort—ancient, indifferent, and hungry for the careless. It serves as the story's wilderness crucible, where the Company must rely on skill rather than walls, and where Veyra's expertise transforms from "useful" to "essential." Near the Silent Hand facility, the forest becomes something worse: a natural space twisted into wrongness, its watchful quality turned predatory.
    
  one_line_essence: "Ancient indifference that punishes the unwary and hides corruption"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "Nature's indifference—the world outside city law and human order"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Crucible of competence—where skill matters more than rank"
      - "Corruption barometer—the forest reflects unnatural taint"
      - "The hunter's domain—Veyra's element where she excels"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "Beauty vs. lethality"
      - "Natural watchfulness vs. unnatural surveillance"
      - "Sanctuary vs. threat"
      - "Known trails vs. shifting terrain"

  transformation_arc: |
    The Thornwood doesn't change so much as reveal different faces. In early appearances (Chapter 8), it's a dangerous but comprehensible wilderness—respect it, and survive. As the Company approaches Silent Hand territory, the forest transitions from indifferent to actively hostile, reflecting magical corruption. The same ancient trees that offered shelter now seem to lean in with predatory interest.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Old-growth temperate forest, centuries of accumulated growth and decay"
  primary_materials:
    - "Ancient hardwood and conifer trunks"
    - "Layered leaf-mold and needle carpet"
    - "Exposed granite outcrops"
    - "Clear cold streams"
    - "Snow and ice (winter)"
    - "Mud and standing water (spring)"
  scale_impression: "Claustrophobic in the dense wood, cathedral-vast where canopy lifts; always feels larger than it should, easy to lose direction within a dozen steps"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Interlocking branches that create a ceiling swallowing light, turning midday into twilight. Deep shadow corridors between massive trunks, broken only by sudden shafts of pale illumination. The forest "closes" visually—sightlines end in brush walls and root tangles, hiding what lies beyond each turn.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Amplified small sounds—every footstep crunches, every branch scrapes against cloth. Wind moves through high canopy like distant surf. Bird calls and sudden coordinated silences that signal predator presence. The disconcerting hush under winter snow, where sound dampens to near-nothing.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Pine resin and wet bark; mineral cold rising from streams. In thaw: rich rot, mushroom-earth, decay-sweet leaf mold. Near corrupted zones: a faint metallic tang, ozone-sharp, that doesn't belong to any natural process.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Cold that seeks every seam in clothing. Ground that shifts—root-webs catching boots, mud grabbing ankles, snow crusts breaking through to soft powder beneath. Bark rough under steadying hands, damp seeping through leather.

  light_character: |
    Light in the Thornwood is treacherous and theatrical. The interlocking canopy creates a twilight default, with sudden shafts of pale gold breaking through where branches have fallen or growth patterns allow. These shafts move with wind and sun angle, making static light sources unreliable. Under winter snow, light reflects upward from the ground, creating an eerie luminosity. In thaw, fog diffuses everything into gray murk.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Weather transforms the Thornwood entirely. Winter brings lethal cold and a hushed cathedral quality—beautiful and deadly. Spring thaw turns the same paths to quagmire, raises fog in hollows, and fills the air with decay-sweet rot. Storm conditions can erase trails entirely, and sudden rain transforms manageable streams into barriers.

      The forest here feels fundamentally wrong. The watchful quality that pervades the Thornwood becomes actively hostile—the woods seem to observe intruders with intelligence rather than instinct.

      "City people think a forest is trees. It's not—it's a conversation happening too fast and too quiet for them to follow. Every broken twig, every bird call, every shift in the silence is telling you something. The Thornwood talks constantly. Most people just don't speak the language."
