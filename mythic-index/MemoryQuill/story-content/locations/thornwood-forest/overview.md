# Thornwood Forest – Overview

## Basic Information
- **Type**: Ancient forest / wilderness region
- **Region**: Northern Sword Coast (north of Waterdeep)
- **Coordinates/Position**: A day’s ride north of the city in good weather; shelters settlements like Millbridge in its shadow
- **First Appearance**: Chapter 8 (The Tracker in the Snow)
- **Significance Level**: Moderate (recurring wilderness setting; hides major threats and travel routes)

## Quick Description
The Thornwood is an old, dense forest of towering trunks, deep hollows, and winding game trails that can swallow a traveler’s sense of direction in a dozen steps. In winter it becomes a hushed cathedral of snow-laden boughs and lethal cold; in spring it turns to a muddy labyrinth heavy with damp earth and decaying leaves. The forest feels watchful—its wildlife quick to react to disturbance, and its shadows deep enough to hide ruins, patrols, and worse.

## Visual Summary
- Ancient trees packed tight; gnarled roots and slick leaf-mold underfoot
- Hidden hollows, fallen logs, and brush walls that break sightlines every few yards
- Seasonal extremes: snow canopy and hard silence in winter; mud, fog, and rot-sweet air in thaw
- Streams and seeps that run clear but carry the forest’s cold, pine-scented breath

## Story Role
- **Story Role**:
  - **Plot Relevance**:
    - Search-and-rescue terrain (Millbridge’s Thornwood incidents; the Old Thornwood Ruins)
    - Infiltration corridor and hostile territory bordering the Silent Hand’s operations; the forest itself feels "contaminated" or "wrong" near their facility
  - **Symbolic Meaning**: Nature’s indifference—beauty and danger braided together; the world outside city law; a barometer for unnatural corruption

## Key Features
- **Notable Landmarks**: Game trails, rocky outcrops suitable for overwatch, hidden clearings, streams feeding toward the northern lake system
- **Unique Aspects**: Forest “closes” visually and acoustically; small movements feel amplified; trails change with weather and use
- **Hazards/Dangers**: Winter exposure, spring quagmire, concealed pits and ruin hazards, patrols/tripwires near hostile installations
- **Resources/Attractions**: Fresh water, herbs and forage, concealment for skilled trackers, defensible camp sites

## Connections
- **Connected Locations**:
  - *The Windborne Roost*: Southern edge waystation and last safe stop before deeper travel
  - *Silent Hand Facility*: Hidden further north; approached through Thornwood terrain
  - *Thornwood Ruins*: Ancient hazard site within the forest (profile recommended separately)
- **Transportation Methods**: Horseback on game trails; on foot in tight brush; streams as landmarks (not always safe to use)
- **Distance from Other Key Locations**: Within several days’ travel of Waterdeep depending on season and route

## Accessibility
- **Who Can Access**: Anyone with a map and courage; safely navigable only with ranger/tracker expertise
- **Restrictions**: Weather and seasonal terrain; hostile patrol presence during the Silent Hand arc
- **Hidden Aspects**: Trails and hollows known to locals and trackers; safe crossings and dry ridges that vanish under snow
- **Secret Paths/Entrances**: Unmarked game trails, low-lying underbrush corridors, rocky spines that keep feet above mud

## Notes
*Use `thornwood-forest` for broad wilderness scenes and travel beats. Reserve sub-profiles for specific sites (ruins, caves, named clearings) when they recur or anchor key events.*
