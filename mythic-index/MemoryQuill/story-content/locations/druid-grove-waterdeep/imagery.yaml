# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Emotional Core
# ============================================================================
narrative_soul: |
  The Druid Grove exists in defiance of Waterdeep's stone certainties—a pocket
  of wild patience hidden within the city's bounds where transformation trauma
  yields to water's memory and the slow work of living wood. Here Vera came
  broken by her dire wolf manifestation, her body marked by wounds that no
  conventional healer could address. Here she found not cure but integration,
  the silver scars that trace her skin becoming marks of wisdom rather than
  damage.

  This is where water speaks. Rill Vossari reads the city's hidden currents
  like letters, tracing magical suppression compounds through water systems
  that reveal the Silent Hand's methods. The pools don't merely heal—they
  remember, reveal, and condemn. When Vera's voice catches speaking of her
  brother taken seven years ago, the water holds that grief too.

  The grove teaches that healing isn't returning to what was, but becoming
  what the wound makes possible. The oak cathedral's living vault has
  witnessed centuries of this work. The meditation spirals slow time until
  fear loosens its grip. The crystalline pools accept whatever enters them
  and return only clarity—blood, tears, rage transformed into understanding.
