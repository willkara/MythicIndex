Let me analyze the Druid Grove Healing Sanctuary thoroughly using the five dimensions of place framework.

## Step 1: Extract Physical Truth

From the description.md:

**Architectural DNA:**
- Living architecture - no built structures
- Shaped-wood arbors, woven hurdles, stone rings
- Natural bowl topography (~200 ft diameter)
- Living oaks trained to form canopy vault (35-50 ft high)
- Three linked spring-fed pools
- Braided paths with bark mulch

**Sensory Signature:**
- Visual: Latticed oak canopy vault, green-gold light pools, clear water mirrors, spiral glades
- Sound: Soft absorption, trickling water, insects/birds, reed chimes, city hush at distance
- Scent: Damp earth, crushed thyme/mint, willow sap, mineral freshness from springs
- Tactile: Velvet moss, ribbed bark, cool pebbles, resilient ground for bare feet

**Canon Details:**
- Ch19: Druid grove within city for specialized recovery
- Ch20: Water system insights, Rill Vossari connection
- Ch24: Referenced in week-3 timeline
- Vera's transformation trauma recovery
- Sequestered woodland hollow with hedgerows and oak ring

## Step 2: Identify Narrative Soul

From overview.md and the chapter context:

**Story Role:**
- Location of Vera's recovery from dire wolf transformation trauma
- Meeting place with Rill Vossari
- Intelligence gathering about Silent Hand water systems
- Represents healing outside conventional medicine/official channels

**Symbolic Weight:**
- Healing and transformation
- Balance between nature and civilization (within city bounds but distinctly natural)
- The Company's growing network of unconventional allies
- Natural wisdom vs. the corruption of the undercity

**Transformation Arc:**
- Place itself doesn't change, but characters' relationship to it does
- Vera arrives broken, leaves restored


- Company gains new ally (Rill) and crucial intelligence here

## Step 3: Map Character-Space Relationships

The sanctuary emerges as a complex healing ecosystem where characters interact with carefully designed natural spaces. Vera finds restoration through three distinct pools - an inner cathedral for deep rest, a restoration pool for physical healing, and a reflection pool for mental and spiritual integration. Rill Vossari uses the scrying pool for water system consultations, while Elder Thornwick moves throughout the oak ring, particularly in the inner sanctum. Each character's movement and interaction is purposefully choreographed within this living, breathing therapeutic landscape.

## Step 4: Catalog Temporal States

The sanctuary pulses with rhythmic energy across daily and seasonal cycles. Dawn brings ground mist and peak birdsong, with cleansing pools at their coldest. Midday intensifies with strong light rays warming reflection pool stones. Evening transforms with ethereal fireflies and foxfire, cooling air inviting sacred rites. Night descends with moonlight filtering through intricate lattices, offering deep, restorative silence.

Seasonal shifts further sculpt the space: spring bursts with new growth and high water flows, summer provides dense shade and pool-cooled respite, autumn sees leaf fall and careful silt maintenance, while winter reveals a bare canopy with strategic windbreak mats and carefully warmed stones.

## Step 5: Contextualize in World

Nestled within Waterdeep's boundaries, this sanctuary exists in a discreet, hidden realm. Accessed through narrow, low-impact paths under woven branch-arches, the location is a natural hollow screened by protective hedgerows and an ancient oak ring. Threshold stones mark sacred transitions, guiding visitors through a carefully orchestrated approach that preserves the space's mystical integrity.

The site exists in profound contrast to urban chaos - city noise completely baffled by dense foliage and strategic terrain. It represents a distinct microclimate, a hidden world thriving mere moments from bustling city streets.
