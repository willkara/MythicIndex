# Druid Grove Healing Sanctuary – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: A sequestered woodland hollow within the bounds of Waterdeep, screened by hedgerows and a ring of old-growth oaks. The grove occupies a natural bowl (approx. 200 ft diameter) with a gentle fall toward spring-fed pools and an outflow rill. Though adjacent to the city’s stone arteries, the grove’s soundscape and microclimate are markedly distinct. [FIRM: ch19 “druid grove within the city”; ch20 reference; ch24 timeline]
- Site Advantages: Topographic enclosure provides wind break and acoustic separation; perennial springs enable hydric healing; layered canopy produces stable, dappled light; soils are loamy and resilient under foot with moss carpeting at slopes.
- Environmental Factors: Coastal humidity moderated by canopy; morning ground mists form around the pool margins; seasonal leaf load cycles and stormwater surges require natural drainage routing; occasional city noise is baffled by foliage density and terrain.
- Approach Routes: Narrow, low-impact paths under woven branch-arches guide entry from discreet city lanes; threshold stones mark transitions. Main ingress follows the ridgeline to minimize erosion before descending to the Oak Cathedral.

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Living architecture—shaped-wood arbors, woven hazel-and-willow hurdles, stone rings and setts, undressed rock seats, and knotted root buttresses used as steps and benches. No cut stone buildings; shelter is formed by the trees themselves and seasonal canvas-or-bark screens.
- Primary Materials:
  - Living Wood: Oak, ash, willow trained through druidic shaping to form arches, lattices, and railings.
  - Stone: Fieldstone rings, stepping setts, seating boulders; flat shale flags at wet crossings.
  - Water: Spring-fed pools with gravel and reed filters; rills edged with cobbles and moss.
  - Plant Fabrics: Woven bark, reed mats, hedging; herb beds mulched with leaf mold.
- Overall Layout: Radial, organic plan with the Oak Cathedral as the center. Concentric use-rings radiate outward—inner pool glades, meditation spirals, herbal gardens, and the protective oak-and-hedge perimeter. Paths are braided to spread traffic and protect roots.

## Detailed Structural Analysis

### The Oak Cathedral (Central Circle)
- Dimensions & Scale: Approx. 90–100 ft diameter inner circle of veteran oaks; branch interweave at 35–50 ft forms a living canopy vault.
- Construction Details:
  - Ground: Moss and leaf duff over compacted loam; discreet stepping setts where traffic concentrates; root buttresses trimmed to form natural seats/steps without harm.
  - Canopy: Trained, grafted limbs create a lattice that filters sun and deflects wind; seasonal pruning maintains light wells.
- Layout Configuration: Inner ring for rites and restorative meditation; mid-ring for small group counsel; outer ring for wayfinding and access to pools and spirals.
- Distinctive Features: Lintelled “green door” arches at the four quarters; threshold stones etched with druidic sigils mark entry/exit.
- Physical Condition: Vigorously healthy; epiphytes and soft mosses abundant; root protection zones observed.

### The Crystalline Pools (Spring-Fed)
- Dimensions & Scale: Three linked basins (cleansing, restoration, reflection/scry), each 20–30 ft across, depth 3–6 ft at centers.
- Construction Details:
  - Basins: Natural stone lined with gravel and clay; reed and iris filtration margins; pebble aprons for entry.
  - Flow: Head spring enters at the cleansing pool, spills to restoration via shallow rill, then to reflection pool; overflow out to reedbed and city drainage.
- Layout Configuration: Low stone sitting ledges; flat flagstones for barefoot approach; small timber footbridge over the linking rill.
- Distinctive Features: Temperature stratification observed—slightly warmer surface in restoration pool by mid-day; foxfire glow algae and glowmoss present seasonally for night orientation (low luminance).
- Physical Condition: Clear, low-turbidity waters; periodic hand-dredge of silt; leaf screens cleaned daily in autumn.

### Meditation Spirals (Quiet Clearings)
- Dimensions & Scale: 15–30 ft diameter spirals of stone pips and moss ribbons set on firm, well-drained loam.
- Construction Details: Spiral lines formed by smooth pebbles and low herb edging; hidden drip line feeds moss in dry spells.
- Layout Configuration: Distributed to cardinal interstices; screened by understory shrubs to afford visual privacy.
- Distinctive Features: Faintly resilient footing promotes slow, balanced walking; chimes woven of twig and seed hang at entries, barely audible.

### Herbal Gardens (Healing Beds)
- Dimensions & Scale: Multiple beds totaling ~2,000–3,000 sq ft within the outer ring.
- Construction Details:
  - Beds: Double-dug loam enriched with leaf mold; wattle edging (hazel/ash) to retain soil; small stone heat sinks to moderate night temperature.
  - Species: Thyme, comfrey, yarrow, willow, mint, foxglove (managed), and seasonal medicinals; plantings companioned to reduce pests.
- Layout Configuration: Curving service paths; low hurdles protect from foraging; label stones identify species in druidic script.
- Distinctive Features: Drying racks of woven willow under canopy gaps; shaded still-niche for low-heat infusions using sun-warmed stones.

### Perimeter Works and Paths
- Construction Details: Braided footpaths mulched with shredded bark; flat stepping stones at damp ground; deadwood hurdles as micro-fences to redirect traffic.
- Drainage: Shallow swales and silt pockets along path sides; root-protection platforms (woven mats) at pinch points; discreet wedge weirs in rills to slow storm surges.
- Distinctive Features: Hedge-and-holly thicket with discreet openings; bird-friendly understory supports quiet soundscape.

### Weather Shelters and Screens
- Construction Details: Seasonal bark screens and woven reed panels lash to living posts; canvas triangles rigged under canopy for rain without open flame.
- Layout Configuration: Edge-of-cathedral shelters for convalescents; low benches on stone staddles keep seating off damp ground.
- Distinctive Features: No permanent buildings; low-impact fixtures removed or composted at season’s end.

## Physical Systems & Infrastructure

### Structural “Engineering” (Living Systems)
- Foundations: Natural; soil compaction controlled by braided paths and rest areas; root-zones protected with permeable decking where necessary.
- Load-Bearing: Living trunks and interlaced branches form wind frames; coppiced staves for small spans; stone boulders act as thermal and seating mass.
- Roofing Systems: Canopy-lattice sheds heavy rain; temporary oiled-canvas sails deployed in storms; high-branch drip edges guide runoff to swales.
- Connections & Joints: Living grafts and flexible lashings; bone/wood pegs for seasonal fixtures; no iron in sacred trunks.

### Environmental Controls
- Heating & Ventilation: Thermal moderation by canopy shade and water bodies; lee planting as windbreak; warmed stones for local comfort; no fire within inner rings (ember bowls at periphery only).
- Lighting Systems:
  - Daylight: Dappled sun through canopy light wells; reflective water patches amplify ambient light.
  - Night: Bioluminescent fungi (foxfire), glowmoss, and druid-lights during rites; strictly low-lumen to protect habitat.
- Water & Sanitation:
  - Supply: Head spring with gravity-fed rills; filtered by reeds/gravel beds; drinking from a designated tap stone downstream of medicinal mixing.
  - Drainage: Overflow to reedbeds; pervious paths/surfaces; storm weirs prevent scouring; silt pockets cleared seasonally.
  - Sanitation: Composting privy glades outside the main circle, downwind; waste cycles integrated into leaf mold compost; absolutely no runoff to pools.
- Climate Protection: Seasonal pruning for wind-load control; leaf litter berms for root insulation; temporary wind-screens rigged in winter squalls.

### Security & Access
- Entry Control: Threshold stones at primary approach; braided hazel wicket woven shut during private rites or convalescence closures.
- Observation Points: Oak-perch lookouts (natural branch saddles) for attendants; thicket scry-stones placed at quarter points for omen-watching.
- Emergency Systems:
  - Fire: Wet-lines (soaked reed mats) staged at perimeter; quick-dam plugs for rills; water-bearers assigned in storm-fire risk.
  - Egress: Meandering routes mapped for stretchers (root-friendly grades); emergency bark screens to make lee shelters quickly.
- Defensive Features: Hedge density and winding approaches reduce intrusion; subtle warding sigils at thresholds; no aggressive works within a healing sanctuary.
