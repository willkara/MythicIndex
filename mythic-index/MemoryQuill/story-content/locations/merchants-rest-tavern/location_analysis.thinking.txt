Looking at this request, I need to analyze the Merchant's Rest Tavern location for illustrated fiction. This is a minor, single-appearance location from Chapter 23.5 where the working class celebrates the Last Light Company's exploits.

Let me work through the analytical framework:

**Physical Truth:**
- Working-class Dock Ward tavern
- "Packed" common room during celebrations
- Thick pipe smoke (FIRM canon)
- Traditional construction (implied)
- Working folk gather here (FIRM)

**Narrative Soul:**
This place is about how ordinary people build legends. It's where competence is celebrated over magic - the working class appreciating "knowing your trade." It's a single appearance but carries significant thematic weight: the Company's reputation being built from the ground up by people who value practical skill.

**Character-Space Relationships:**
The Company isn't present - this is about how they're perceived BY others. The key figures are:
- Jorik One-Eye (eyewitness)
- Tam (eyewitness)  
- Older carpenter (professional observer)

The characters being discussed:
- Grimjaw (stone-listening technique)
- Rill (water manipulation)
- Veyra (professional bearing)

**Temporal States:**
Only one state matters: the celebration moment. This is a snapshot in time.

**Contextual Place:**
- Dock Ward, Waterdeep
- Harbor district
- Working waterfront neighborhood

**Zones:**
Given it's a tavern, the main zone is the common room. The bar/service area is implied but secondary.

**Image Opportunities:**
This is a single-appearance, minor location. But it has strong visual potential:
1. The packed celebration moment - working class toasting, pipe smoke, tankards raised
2. The storytelling moment - Jorik or Tam recounting, crowd listening

The "soul" of this place is about working people making legends from competence. The visual hook is the communal celebration - not the physical tavern, but what happens IN it.


I'll structure the output systematically, focusing on the key narrative and visual elements that make this location unique. The tavern represents more than a physical space - it's a crucible of community storytelling and shared experience.
