- **Significance Level**: Minor (community celebration hub)

## Quick Description
A packed Dock Ward establishment where working folk gather—longshoremen, barrel-makers, carters, and carpenters crowding the common room under a thick haze of pipe smoke. When the Last Light Company's exploits make the news, this is where the tradespeople raise their tankards and toast "To a job well done!" with genuine civic pride.

## Visual Summary

## Story Role
- **Plot Relevance**: Primary gathering place for community celebration of the Library Rescue; where ordinary citizens build legends around the Company's deeds
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Pride in professional competence—the common folk appreciate "knowing your trade" and celebrate practical skill over flashy magic
- **Recurring Location**: No (single appearance)
- **Key Events**: Celebration of the Great Library rescue; eyewitness accounts of Grimjaw's stone-listening technique and Rill's water manipulation

## Clientele & Culture

## Cultural Significance
The Merchant's Rest represents where legend meets labor. Unlike noble salons where heroes might be discussed abstractly, here the working people who actually witnessed events share their accounts. The focus isn't on mysterious powers but on technique: how Grimjaw listened to the stone, how Rill moved water "just so," how Veyra carried herself with professional bearing. It's a place where competence is the highest compliment.
