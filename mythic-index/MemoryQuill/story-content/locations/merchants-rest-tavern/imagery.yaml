narrative_soul: |
  The Merchant's Rest is where legend meets labor—a packed Dock Ward tavern where
  working folk gather to share stories, raise tankards, and celebrate practical
  competence over flashy magic. When the Last Light Company's exploits make the
  headlines, it's here that longshoremen, barrel-makers, carters, and carpenters
  offer their highest praise: "They know their trade."

  Visually, this is a space of thick pipe smoke, warm lamplight, and raised
  tankards. The air is hazy, the crowd is dense, and every surface shows the
  honest wear of working hands. Unlike noble salons where heroes are discussed
  abstractly, here the people who witnessed events share eyewitness accounts—
  focusing on technique, on method, on how Grimjaw listened to the stone and
  how Rill moved the water "just so."

  The dominant emotional register is celebratory pride in craft. When someone
  calls out "To a job well done!" and the tavern roars back, that's the heart
  of this place—collective acknowledgment that competence is the currency of
  respect among those who build Waterdeep with their hands.

one_line_essence: "Pipe smoke and tankards raised—where working folk celebrate competence as the highest virtue."
