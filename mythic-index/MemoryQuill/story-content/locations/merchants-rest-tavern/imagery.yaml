            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            - character portraits (identity references)

            - a location overview (environment reference)

            - style references (art direction)


            Generate a NEW scene matching the scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Avoid “real-world medieval Europe” drift; keep fantasy species variety and magical infrastructure plausible and grounded-in-world (not neon).

            5. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.


            SCENARIO: Jorik One-Eye: one eye missing or scarred, weathered dock worker face, hands raised in demonstration, mimicking stone-listening posture, crowd leaning in, tankards forgotten, pipe smoke throughout, amber lamp-haze, working-class clothing on all figures, rapt attention on listening faces, thick stratum of pipe smoke hanging at head-height, amber lamplight filtering through perpetual haze, packed crowd of working folk pressing close, forest of raised tankards during toasts, worn timber construction and plank flooring, trade-specific clothing visible throughout (coopers' aprons, longshoremen's weathered gear, carpenters' sawdusted vests), enchanted hanging sign that shifts subtly with wind and weather, everwarm hearthstone and evercool cellar rune (practical comfort magic), ward-lanterns that resist smoke and spill (steady amber light), a mixed crowd (human, dwarf, halfling, tiefling) at tables and bar, The common room during the celebration, but focused on this moment of storytelling. Jorik One-Eye stands at center of attention—one eye scarred or covered, weathered face animated, hands raised in demonstration mimicking Grimjaw's stone-listening posture. Around him, the crowd leans in: working faces emerging from pipe smoke, tankards held forgotten at lip-level, eyes fixed on the storyteller. The lamplight catches Jorik's hands as they shape the air—this is how it happened, this is what I saw. The background shows more patrons, soft-focus, the amber haze of smoke and light., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: This is the moment of legend-making. An ordinary dock worker is translating extraordinary deeds into language his peers understand. \"The dwarf listened to the stone like it was telling him secrets.\" Magic becomes craft. The Company's reputation is being forged right here, in this story, by this man., Medium shot with Jorik prominent but not isolated. He should be slightly elevated (standing while others sit) with the crowd creating a semicircle of attention around him. His hands at mid-gesture—showing the stone-listening posture. The crowd's rapt faces provide context and stakes. Depth created by smoke layers and soft-focus background patrons., evening, interior, light from oil lamp catching Jorik's hands and face, warm, focusing attention, from the side, creating drama on his features, amber-gold tones, deep shadows define his weathered features shadows, smoke catching light, hazing the background, dominant colors: amber lamplight, tobacco smoke tones, weathered skin; accent colors: Jorik's hands highlighted, gleaming eyes in crowd, high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: dark aged timber frame, functional construction, worn plank boards showing decades of boot-traffic, ring-marked from generations of mugs, sturdy utilitarian benches and tables, built for working hands, Mood intent: The storytelling moment requires focused attention—Vermeer's quality of single-source illumination on a compelling subject. The crowd leans in; tankards are forgotten; the story commands the room. Intimate rather than celebratory because this is about transmission, connection, the sacred act of bearing witness.

            , storytelling moment, high-fantasy adventuring tone, emotional lighting, atmospheric depth, subtle spell effects, focus on character expressions, dramatic composition, Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.

            SCENARIO: dozens of raised tankards in unified gesture, pipe smoke stratum at head-height, amber-lit, work-worn hands as primary subject (rope burns, sawdust, calluses, tar), faces emerging from smoke, mouths open in shared cry, Jorik One-Eye identifiable (scarred/missing eye), older carpenter with sawdust beard, dignified raise, trade-specific clothing visible (coopers, longshoremen, carpenters, carters), packed bodies, standing room only density, thick stratum of pipe smoke hanging at head-height, amber lamplight filtering through perpetual haze, packed crowd of working folk pressing close, forest of raised tankards during toasts, worn timber construction and plank flooring, trade-specific clothing visible throughout (coopers' aprons, longshoremen's weathered gear, carpenters' sawdusted vests), enchanted hanging sign that shifts subtly with wind and weather, everwarm hearthstone and evercool cellar rune (practical comfort magic), ward-lanterns that resist smoke and spill (steady amber light), a mixed crowd (human, dwarf, halfling, tiefling) at tables and bar, The climactic moment: a forest of raised tankards punching through the amber smoke-haze. Working hands—rope-burned, calloused, sawdust-dusted, tar-stained—unified in the same gesture. Faces emerge from the murk, all turned toward an invisible center, mouths open in the same cry. The smoke stratum at head-height catches the lamplight, making the tankards glow. Jorik One-Eye's scarred face visible in the crowd. The older carpenter's dignified raise. Tam's bright-eyed enthusiasm. But the real subject is the HANDS—the anonymous working hands that built Waterdeep, now building a legend. This is the moment competence becomes folklore., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: This is where the Last Light Company's legend escapes their control. Not in a noble hall or a bardic performance, but in a working tavern where ordinary people decide what matters. \"To a job well done\"—the highest compliment, given by the only audience whose opinion truly measures worth., Medium-wide shot from slightly below eye level, looking UP into the raised tankards. This makes the viewer feel part of the crowd, participating in the toast. The smoke stratum creates depth separation—foreground hands sharp, background figures softer. Faces visible but secondary to hands. The unified gesture is the subject: dozens of arms raised as one., evening, peak celebration, interior, light from multiple oil lamps creating pooled amber light, warm, hazy, filtering through perpetual smoke, various sources creating soft all-around illumination, amber-gold dominant tones, soft-edged, smoke diffuses hard shadows shadows, thick pipe smoke catching and scattering light, dominant colors: amber gold (tankards and lamplight), tobacco smoke blue-brown, weathered skin tones; accent colors: ale amber catching light, pewter gleam on tankards, high fantasy, celebratory atmosphere, materials: dark aged timber frame, functional construction, worn plank boards showing decades of boot-traffic, ring-marked from generations of mugs, sturdy utilitarian benches and tables, built for working hands, Mood intent: This is the visual thesis of the entire location.

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a specific LOCATION.

            Generate a NEW image of this SAME location in the described scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. LOCATION IDENTITY: Preserve architecture, materials, lighting language, and signature elements from the references.

            2. FANTASY TONE: This is a high-fantasy world (D&D / Faerûn vibe). Include subtle magical infrastructure (runes, enchanted lanterns, ward-stones, guild sigils) where appropriate.

            3. NO FACE CLONING: If people appear, keep them generic and varied—do not repeat an identical face across images unless explicitly required.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            5. PRIORITY: If the scenario conflicts with the references, follow the scenario for composition/mood while preserving the location’s identity.


            SCENARIO: warm amber light spilling from windows and doorway, pipe smoke visibly seeping from openings into cold air, silhouettes of packed crowd visible through windows, Dock Ward context: cobblestones, warehouse silhouettes, maritime atmosphere, working folk approaching entrance, drawn by warmth, timber construction, worn and practical, thick stratum of pipe smoke hanging at head-height, amber lamplight filtering through perpetual haze, packed crowd of working folk pressing close, forest of raised tankards during toasts, worn timber construction and plank flooring, trade-specific clothing visible throughout (coopers' aprons, longshoremen's weathered gear, carpenters' sawdusted vests), enchanted hanging sign that shifts subtly with wind and weather, everwarm hearthstone and evercool cellar rune (practical comfort magic), ward-lanterns that resist smoke and spill (steady amber light), a mixed crowd (human, dwarf, halfling, tiefling) at tables and bar, Close-up of a large wooden ale barrel in the cool cellar. Faint, cold blue-white runes are visible on the stone wall behind it—the 'evercool' magic. Condensation beads on the barrel's metal bands. The lighting is dim and cool, emphasizing the preservation function., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: Shows the practical application of magic in this world—improving daily life (cold ale) rather than just combat., Macro or close shot. Barrel texture vs. stone wall texture. Runes faint but visible. Condensation as tactical detail., any, light from faint blue-white rune glow, cool, shadowy, dominant colors: stone grey, barrel wood brown, rune blue-white; accent colors: tobacco smoke blue-brown, warm flesh tones of approaching figures, high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: dark aged timber frame, functional construction, worn plank boards showing decades of boot-traffic, ring-marked from generations of mugs, sturdy utilitarian benches and tables, built for working hands, Mood intent: Focus on the practical magic that serves the tavern's function. Cool tones contrast with the warm tavern above.

            , high-fantasy interior architecture, wide establishing composition, enchanted lanternlight and arcane glow, subtle runes and warding motifs, intricate craftsmanship, detailed stone/wood/metal textures, storytelling composition, Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.
