creatures:
  - name: Coin Counter
    description: Translucent fey creatures obsessed with counting and organizing money. They nest in cash boxes and strong rooms, spending nights arranging coins by denomination, date, and mint mark. They become distressed when accounts don't balance and will sometimes "correct" discrepancies.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent humanoid forms about 6 inches tall
      - Fingers unusually long and precise, perfect for handling coins
      - Eyes like polished gold coins set in crystalline faces
      - Bodies faintly glow with metallic sheen—copper, silver, or gold
      - Move with quick, efficient gestures like counting machines
    habitat:
      where: Cash boxes, strongboxes, and counting rooms
      when: Most active after closing during coin counting and reconciliation
      why: Feed on the abstract concept of wealth and commerce
    behavior:
      who: Small groups of 3-5 living in specific establishments
      what: Organize currency, detect counterfeit coins, maintain perfect counts
      how: Supernatural precision in counting and detecting weight/composition differences
    lore: Innkeepers who earn a Coin Counter colony never have accounting errors. The creatures won't tolerate dishonest money—they eject counterfeits from cash boxes and sometimes bite thieves. One bartender found every stolen coin she'd pocketed arranged on her pillow in an accusatory pile. She paid it back the next day.

  - name: Rumor Rat
    description: Unusual rats with oversized ears that eavesdrop on conversations and repeat fragments to each other in chittering mimicry. They don't understand words but recognize patterns, creating a living archive of overheard conversations that manifests as uncanny "coincidences."
    visual_aspects:
      - Slightly larger than normal rats with disproportionately large ears
      - Ears swivel independently, always orienting toward conversations
      - Mouths move constantly, chittering in patterns that mimic speech rhythms
      - Fur in varied browns and grays, almost always groomed and clean
      - Eyes unusually bright and attentive
    habitat:
      where: Walls, ceilings, and hidden spaces throughout the tavern
      when: Active during business hours; rest when tavern is empty
      why: Unknown; possibly magical mutation from ambient speech and emotion
    behavior:
      who: Colony of 15-20 living in the building's infrastructure
      what: Listen to everything, repeat fragments to each other
      how: Create uncanny synchronicities by chittering in adjacent rooms
    lore: Merchants planning deals sometimes hear their own words echoed from the walls. A Watch investigator once heard a suspect's alibi contradicted by rat chittering that perfectly mimicked the actual conversation. The innkeeper refuses to discuss whether she can understand them, but she always seems to know everything happening in her establishment.

  - name: Comfort Cushion
    description: Enchanted cushions that move to wherever they're most needed. They appear on hard chairs when patrons are tired, support sore backs, and somehow multiply during busy nights. They're warm, perfectly firm, and smell faintly of lavender and wool.
    visual_aspects:
      - Hand-stitched cushions in various fabrics and patterns
      - Always appear clean and freshly fluffed
      - Slight warmth as if recently sat upon
      - Embroidered patterns seem to shift subtly
      - Never quite the same cushion in the same spot twice
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the common room and private rooms
      when: Appear when needed; vanish when not
      why: Manifestation of the tavern's hospitality and comfort
    behavior:
      who: Unknown number; possibly the same cushions moving or many individuals
      what: Provide comfort and support exactly when needed
      how: Appear on chairs, behind backs, under feet with perfect timing
    lore: Regular travelers swear the Merchant's Rest has the most comfortable seating in Waterdeep. The owner claims she just has good cushions. But travelers report the same cushion appearing in different rooms, and wounded soldiers find them providing perfect support for injuries. Some believe they're blessed by Sune, goddess of comfort and beauty.

  - name: Trade Wind
    description: A minor air elemental that circulates through the tavern carrying scents, sounds, and whispers of distant markets. It brings news of trade routes, cargo prices, and market conditions to those who know how to interpret its messages.
    visual_aspects:
      - Nearly invisible except as rippling air and floating dust motes
      - Carries scents from distant places—spices, sea air, forest pine
      - Creates gentle breezes that circulate through rooms
      - Occasionally visible as spiral patterns in smoke or steam
      - Sounds like distant market calls and ship bells when it passes
    habitat:
      where: Circulates through common room and sleeping areas
      when: Most active during meal times and gatherings
      why: Drawn to merchants and trade discussion; feeds on commercial energy
    behavior:
      who: Single elemental that's haunted the tavern for decades
      what: Carries sensory information about distant trade centers
      how: Experienced merchants can "read" its scents and sounds for market intelligence
    lore: Old merchant traders claim the Trade Wind has made them fortunes. "Smell cinnamon and hear Calimshan bells? Spice prices are about to spike. Smell sea salt and hear storm winds? Coastal shipping delays are coming." The innkeeper encourages the superstition—whether real or placebo, her merchants are consistently lucky.
