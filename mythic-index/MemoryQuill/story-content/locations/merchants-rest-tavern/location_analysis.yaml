  narrative_soul: |
    The Merchant's Rest is where legends are forged by calloused hands. It's not about the 
    tavern itself—it's about what happens when working people witness something extraordinary 
    and process it through the lens of their own values. Here, heroes aren't mysterious figures 
    with arcane powers; they're craftspeople who "know their trade." The pipe smoke and packed 
    bodies create a communal crucible where the Last Light Company's reputation transforms from 
    news into folklore, one appreciative toast at a time.

  transformation_arc: |
    The tavern itself doesn't change—but it represents a transformation happening to the 
    Company. This is the moment their story escapes their control and becomes public 
    property. By the time Jorik One-Eye and Tam finish their accounts, the Company's 
    deeds have been translated into working-class language: not mysterious magic, but 
    skill. Not power, but professionalism. The Company doesn't know it, but their 
    legend is being built in this smoky room by people who will never meet them.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Traditional Dock Ward working-class establishment"
  primary_materials:
    - "Timber frame"
    - "Worn plank flooring"
    - "Functional stone hearth"
  scale_impression: "Capacious but intimate when packed—bodies press together, conversations blend"
  
  visual_signature: |
    The thick stratum of pipe smoke that hangs at head-height, turning lamplight into 
    amber halos. Raised tankards catching that hazy glow. A sea of working hands—
    rope-burned, sawdust-dusted, dock-weathered—wrapped around mugs.
    
  sound_signature: |
    The roar of collective conversation punctuated by eruptions of laughter and unified 
    cheers. The percussion of tankards striking tables. The momentary hush when a good 
    storyteller reaches the crucial part, then the appreciative rumble when the point 
    lands.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Tobacco smoke dominant, layered over ale, honest sweat, sawdust traces, tar from 
    longshoremen's clothes, the salt-and-fish undertone that permeates everything in 
    the Dock Ward.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    The warmth of packed bodies pressing close. The slight tackiness of worn tables. 
    The cool weight of a tankard. Elbows brushing neighbors with every gesture.

  light_character: |
    Standard tavern lamplight rendered atmospheric by pipe smoke—warm amber glow that 
    doesn't fully penetrate the haze. Creates soft-edged figures, makes the crowded 
    room feel like a single organism rather than discrete individuals. Raised tankards 
    catch highlights; faces emerge from and recede into the murk.
    
  weather_influence: |
    The Dock Ward weather exists outside these walls. Inside is its own climate—warm 
    from bodies, smoky from pipes, sealed from the harbor winds. Rain or shine doesn't 
    matter here; what matters is the ale and the company.

contextual_place:
  region: "Dock Ward, Waterdeep"
  neighborhood_character: |
    Working waterfront—salt air, ship timber, the constant presence of the harbor. 
    A neighborhood where wealth is measured in calluses and competence. The Merchant's 
    Rest sits where tradespeople naturally flow after shift: coopers from the barrel-yards, 
    longshoremen from the wharves, carpenters from the shipyards.
    
  approach_sequences:
    - name: "After the shift"
      description: |
        Workers stream from docks and yards, boots on cobbles, following the gravitational 
        pull of familiar warmth. The tavern's glow spills from windows into the evening 
        streets.
      first_impression: "Coming home to company"
      
    - name: "During celebration"
      description: |
        The noise reaches you first—that unmistakable roar of a crowd with something to 
        celebrate. Light and smoke leak from every opening. The street outside has its 
        own overflow crowd sharing news.
      first_impression: "Something's happened. Something good."
      
  visible_beyond:

      what_visible: "Dock Ward streets, working wharves, warehouse silhouettes"
      
  spatial_relationship: |
    Embedded in the Dock Ward's working fabric—not a destination but a natural gathering 
    point. Close to wharves and yards, accessible to the tradespeople who make this 
    district run.

    physical_description: |
      Open floor plan designed for maximum occupancy. Tables and benches arranged for 
      group seating but clearable for standing-room during peaks. Low ceiling traps 
      the pipe smoke in a visible stratum. Worn plank floors show decades of boot-traffic.
      
    narrative_function: |
      This is where stories become legends. Not through formal recitation but organic 
      transmission—one eyewitness tells another, details sharpen with repetition, the 
      collective decides what matters. The Last Light Company's exploits get translated 
      here into working-class values: not magic, but mastery.

      This is the visual thesis of the scene: working people consecrating heroes

      Medium-wide shot from slightly below eye level, looking up into the raised
