This is a comprehensive request to create location imagery specifications for the Azure Pavilion. Let me carefully analyze the input and create a production-ready imagery.yaml file.

Key elements from the analysis:

**Location Identity:**
- Civic venue - open-air marble colonnade on a pier
- "A floating stage where legitimacy is conferred under azure skies"
- Recognition ceremony location for Last Light Company
- Represents threshold between outsider and accepted

**Physical Truth:**
- White marble paving and column cladding
- Azure-glazed ceramic roof tiles
- Oak piles and timber framing
- Copper ridge caps with verdigris
- Enchanted crystal lanterns (silver-white)
- ~100 ft x 200 ft pavilion on 300 ft pier
- Column grid on ~20 ft centers
- Balustrade with wave and knot motifs

**Zones:**
1. Pier Approach (threshold) - 300-ft processional
2. Pierhead Gate (threshold) - wrought-iron double gates
3. Central Nave and Dais (heart) - ceremonial core
4. Balustrade Promenade (commons) - perimeter circulation
5. Leeward Bays (sanctuary) - sheltered alcoves
6. Service Aisles (liminal) - staff movement

**Temporal States:**
- Pre-dawn: dormant, security only
- Morning: setup, preparation
- Midday: blazing brilliance
- Evening: THE signature hour - azure deepens, lanterns bloom
- Night: intimate silver pools

**Weather States:**
- Clear: signature brilliance
- Fog: ethereal isolation
- Storm: contracted to leeward bays

**Recommended Images from Analysis:**
1. Establishing - evening from pier approach (primary)
2. Essence - interior at golden hour (primary)
3. Inhabited - recognition ceremony (primary)
4. Zone - pier at night with lanterns (secondary)


5. Temporal - fog variant (secondary)
6. Perspective - balustrade harbor view (optional)
7. Zone - leeward bays with windbreaks (optional)

I'm focusing on mood mapping for the imagery, particularly the establishing shot. The evening approach requires a nuanced emotional tone that captures both ceremonial gravitas and mystical transformation. I'll explore blending SOMBER and ETHEREAL moods to convey the pavilion's profound liminal quality, emphasizing the threshold between recognition and anonymity.

The narrative centers on the Last Light Company's recognition ceremony, with Captain Grimsby as a potential key witness or participant. Each image variant will capture a different emotional resonance of this pivotal moment.

Mood selections trace the emotional landscape: from the dreamy silver-lanterned interior to the weighted anticipation of the pier, each scene demands precise atmospheric calibration. The fog and balustrade perspectives offer additional emotional depth - one explicitly ethereal, the other contemplatively expansive.

Visual anchoring will ground these mood explorations, with the azure-glazed tile canopy serving as a transitional element that deepens with the approaching dusk.

Architectural elements create a sophisticated spatial narrative: white marble floors intersect with fluted columns, while enchanted crystal lanterns cast silvery illumination. The perimeter balustrade, etched with wave and knot motifs, suggests fluid connectivity between structural planes.

Materials tell a textural story of seasoned craftsmanship - oak and larch timbers darkened by tar, white marble transitioning from brilliant to cream, bronze hardware providing subtle metallic accents. The copper ridge caps' verdigris patina hints at elegant weathering, while the harbor's persistent presence anchors every perspective.

The design integrates structural rhythm through column grids and carefully modulated material transitions, creating a contemplative yet dynamic spatial experience.
