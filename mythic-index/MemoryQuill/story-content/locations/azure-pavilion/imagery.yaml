    The Azure Pavilion is a stage that believes in performance—every sightline calculated,
    every surface polished to reflect status. It welcomes the powerful with open arms and
    reminds warriors that grace can be as treacherous as any battlefield. It judges those
    who enter by how they move across its marble, and rewards those who understand its
    language with unobstructed views of Waterdeep's heart.

  scene_mood: "celebratory"
  mood_rationale: |
    The establishing shot captures the pavilion at its intended purpose—a stage for
    Waterdeep's elite to gather and perform. The mood is celebratory but controlled,
    prestige architecture designed to impress rather than comfort.

  visual_description: |
    The Azure Pavilion extends over Waterdeep Harbor on its 300-foot timber-and-stone
    pier, a floating stage of white marble and azure-glazed roofs. Fluted columns march
    in disciplined rows beneath alternating gable bays, their copper ridges catching
    the last light. The low marble balustrade rings the perimeter, wave-and-knot carvings
    visible at the near edge. Crystal lanterns hang in arrays from bronze ring points,
    their silver-white glow just beginning to assert against the fading sky. Mount
    Waterdeep rises in the distant harbor mist, and the city spreads behind—a reminder
    that this stage floats above the world it serves.

  composition_notes: |
    Wide establishing shot from slightly elevated angle (perhaps from a passing vessel
    or the pier approach). The pavilion fills the middle third of frame, pier stretching
    toward the viewer. The azure roofline creates strong horizontal against the vertical
    of Mount Waterdeep behind. Depth through layered planes: pier, pavilion, harbor, mountain.

  narrative_significance: |
    The Azure Pavilion represents Waterdeep's power performing for itself. Here the
    Last Light Company first received civic recognition, and here they returned to
    play espionage games amid glittering danger. The location is both stage and cage.

    ridge caps with verdigris patina catching golden sunset light. White marble floor
    visible through rows of fluted columns on granite plinths. Low marble balustrade
    rings the perimeter with carved wave motifs. Crystal lanterns hanging from bronze
    rings beginning to glow silver-white. Wide angle from slightly elevated position

    light breeze suggested by banner movement. Fantasy civic architecture, Waterdeep
    harbor district. Subtle ward-marks on gateposts, guild seal on approach bollards.
    No people in frame—the empty stage awaiting performance.

    visual_description: |
      The waist-high marble balustrade curves along the pavilion's seaward edge,
      its wave-and-knot carvings catching oblique light. Bronze stanchions anchor
      removable lantern poles at regular intervals. The polished marble floor shows
      subtle salt-etching near the edge where spray reaches on windy days. Beyond
      the balustrade, the harbor stretches to the horizon, small boats dotting the
      water, the lighthouse of Waterdeep visible in the distance.

      Medium shot along the balustrade length, camera at standing height. The carved

      shows subtle grid patterns from the column shadows. At the far end, a low
      raised platform serves as the speaking position, rope stanchions defining its
      apron. Crystal lantern arrays hang overhead in greater density here, creating
      overlapping pools of silver-white light. The azure roof bays frame the space

      The column grid creates a forest of fluted marble drums, each rising from
      granite plinths to disappear into the timber truss darkness above. The

      spots and concealment. Light from the crystal lanterns falls in patterns,

      unexpectedly far.

      The essence image captures the pavilion at its most magical—when the azure
      tiles reach their deepest twilight blue and the crystal lanterns achieve
      full silver-white bloom. This is the moment the location becomes sublime.

    visual_description: |
      The pavilion at the blue hour—that fleeting moment between sunset and
      darkness when the azure tiles seem to glow with their own inner light. The
      sky holds the same deep blue as the roof, creating a seamless boundary
      between architecture and atmosphere. Crystal lanterns bloom in full silver-
      white radiance, their light mirrored in the still harbor waters below. The
      marble takes on a cool luminescence, the columns becoming ghostly sentinels.
      Mount Waterdeep is a dark silhouette, the city behind just beginning to
      sparkle with its own lights.

    composition_notes: |
      Wide establishing shot capturing the full pavilion at the blue hour. Emphasis
      on the color harmony between tiles and sky. Reflection in harbor water doubles
      the luminous effect. Minimal contrast—everything bathed in the same azure glow.

    narrative_significance: |
      This is the pavilion at its most honest expression of purpose—a floating
      stage of light above the water, designed to make those within feel they've
      ascended to something beyond the ordinary city below.

      A single enchanted crystal lantern hangs from its bronze ring point, the
      faceted crystal catching and refracting the silver-white magical light
      within. The light source appears sourceless—no flame, no visible mechanism,
      just gentle radiance that seems to breathe with slow pulsation. Bronze
      fittings connect the crystal housing to the suspension chain. Tiny motes
      of light drift in the immediate vicinity, magical overflow from the
      photomancy. The timber truss above provides context, the marble floor
      below reflects the glow in soft pools.

      The main pavilion floor empty but prepared for an event. Trestle tables

      patterns on the marble. The balustrade loop offers circulation space.

      Oil painting, matte finish, visible brushwork. Civic recognition ceremony in
      an open-air marble pavilion. Raised dais with human official in formal
      attire holding crystal glass aloft for toast. In the crowd, a half-elf
      woman with burn scar on left face and dark mohawk with braids stands with
      dignified composure beside a human man with steel-gray hair and soldier's
      bearing. Other formal-dressed companions nearby. Crowd of mixed fantasy
      ancestries—humans, dwarves, elves, tieflings—raising glasses in response.
      Crystal lantern arrays at full brightness overhead. Azure tile roof visible
      through timber bays. Celebratory atmosphere, public acknowledgment. Wide
      shot capturing both dais and recipients.

      The service aisles represent the functional infrastructure of pavilion
      events—the paths servers use, the corridors that keep hospitality flowing
      invisibly alongside the social performance.

    visual_description: |
      A side aisle between column rows, designed for service circulation. The
      space is narrower than the central nave, columns closer together creating
      a utilitarian corridor. Subtle rope stanchions mark the service path,
      separating it from guest circulation. A service cart waits against a
      column base. The marble here shows more wear—the path of countless feet
      carrying countless trays. Through the columns, the main floor is visible,
      the formal event continuing while this corridor does its work.

    composition_notes: |
      Medium shot down a service aisle, showing the corridor character. Columns
      create rhythm and framing. Service cart as evidence of function. Main
      floor visible through column gaps.

    narrative_significance: |
      The service aisles are where the invisible labor happens—the infrastructure
      that makes elegant events possible, the paths the powerful don't notice.

      Oil painting, matte finish, visible brushwork. Service corridor in an open-air
      pavilion, a side aisle between column rows. Narrower than the main nave,
      utilitarian character. Subtle rope stanchions marking the service path.
      Wooden service cart against a column base. Marble floor showing more wear
      from countless feet. Main floor event visible through column gaps—contrast
      between service corridor and display space. Functional lighting, less
      ornate than central areas. The infrastructure of hospitality. No people
      in immediate frame, activity implied.
