    Where marble rises from the sea and lantern light crowns civic ambition. This open-air
    pavilion on its slender pier is Waterdeep's stage for public triumph—the place where
    power wears its finest clothes and congratulates itself beneath azure tiles that deepen
    to twilight hues as the day surrenders. Here, the Last Light Company received its first
    official recognition, stepping from shadows into the complicated light of legitimacy
    while enemies watched and smiled with too many teeth.

  visual_description: |
    The Azure Pavilion emerges from Waterdeep Harbor like a crown of white marble and deep blue tile,
    suspended at the end of a slender pier that stretches 300 feet across the water. The evening light
    transforms it into something from a painter's dream—sunset gilding the fluted columns while the
    azure-glazed roof tiles deepen from day-sky blue to the color of twilight itself.

    The open colonnade creates a forest of white pillars beneath the sweeping gables, each bay framing
    a different view of the harbor and the city beyond. Enchanted crystal lanterns float at their
    appointed stations, their silver-white glow beginning to compete with the fading sun. The marble
    floor catches both lights—the warm copper of sunset and the cool silver of magic—creating pools
    of color that shift as guests move through the space.

    Beyond the balustrade, the harbor spreads in gentle swells, fishing boats and merchant vessels
    at anchor, Mount Waterdeep rising in the distance. The copper ridge caps catch the last rays,
    their verdigris patina glowing green-gold. Everything about the pavilion speaks of permanence
    and prestige, of a city confident enough to build beauty over water.
  composition_notes: "Wide establishing shot from harbor approach, pier leading eye toward the pavilion. Sunset lighting from left, lanterns just beginning to glow. Include water reflections and distant city silhouette."

    visual_description: |
      The central nave runs the full length of the pavilion, a grand processional space defined by
      the rhythm of fluted columns on either side. The marble floor stretches in unbroken white,
      anchor points for rope stanchions and dais platforms recessed flush with the surface. Overhead,
      the azure-tiled gables create a cathedral of open air, the alternating bays allowing views of
      the harbor on both sides.

      Crystal lanterns float at measured intervals along the column lines, their silver glow competing
      with the warm light that filters through the open colonnades. The central axis draws the eye
      toward the leeward edge where the announcer's dais would stand, positioned for optimal projection
      across the space. The floor shows the subtle wear of countless formal gatherings—not damage,
      but the patina of purpose.

      The pavilion at first light is a study in pearl and gold. Dew glistens on the azure tiles,
      each droplet catching the earliest rays as the sun climbs over Waterdeep. The marble floor
      holds the night's coolness, its white surface blushing faintly pink where the light first
      touches. Gulls have claimed the balustrade as their morning perch, their calls the only sound
      above the gentle lap of harbor water.

      The columns cast long shadows toward the city, their fluted surfaces catching the light in
      vertical stripes of gold and shade. The crystal lanterns are dark now, their enchantment
      dormant until evening calls them forth again. A maintenance worker moves quietly through
      the far end of the space, checking the storm-curtain rigging, but otherwise the pavilion
      belongs to the morning and the sea.

      A semi-enclosed bay along the leeward edge of the pavilion, the recognition gallery offers
      a degree of shelter from the sea breeze while maintaining the open aesthetic. Canvas
      windbreaks can be rigged here during inclement weather, their rope lacing to bronze rings
      along the balustrade. The space is intimate compared to the central nave—a gathering
      point for small groups before they're called to the dais.

      Marble benches line one side, their surfaces worn smooth by generations of nervous hands.
      The column spacing creates natural alcoves for private conversation, each framing a different
      angle on the harbor. Tonight, crystal lanterns cluster more densely here, their light
      focused on the faces of those about to step into public recognition.

      Three hundred feet of tarred oak planking stretches between the harbor quay and the
      floating pavilion, a processional of exposure and anticipation. The pier is wide enough
      for paired processions—two lines of guests approaching, two lines departing—with bollards
      and mooring rings marking the edges. Lantern posts rise at regular intervals, their oil
      lamps (or enchanted crystals during formal events) creating pools of light that guide
      the way forward.

      The approach offers no cover, no side routes, no shortcuts. Security screeners staff
      the first lay-by niche at one-third distance, checking invitations and assessing arrivals.
      The chainable bollards can halt any approach instantly. Every step brings the pavilion
      closer, its azure tiles catching the light, its columns promising shelter—but only for
      those deemed worthy to enter.

      Between the columns on the windward side, the perimeter balustrade frames the harbor

      toward the open sea. The carved wave and knot motifs on the marble balustrade echo
      the water they overlook.

      Guests drift to these edges for quiet conversation, for fresh air, for a moment's
      escape from the social theater of the central nave. Lifebuoys hang at interval posts,
      their red-and-white stripes a practical reminder that beauty floats above dangerous
      depths. At night, the harbor becomes a field of lantern reflections, the pavilion's
      light joining the running lights of anchored vessels.

      The first lantern brightens with a soft pulse, its crystal heart catching fire with
      silver-white light. Then another, and another, the enchantment cascading through the
      pavilion like a wave of awakening stars. Within moments, the entire colonnade is crowned
      with floating lights, each suspended from its bronze ring point, each casting a pool of
      gentle radiance onto the marble below.

      The timing is always the same—that precise moment when the sunset can no longer hold
      its own against the gathering dark. The lanterns don't banish the night; they negotiate
      with it, creating a space of managed illumination where shadows are softened rather than
      eliminated. The effect is theatrical, intentional, the signature moment that transforms
      the Azure Pavilion from architecture into experience.

      galleries. The acoustics favor quiet conversation—voices don't carry across the marble
      like they do in the central nave.

      Small groups cluster in these bays, heads bent together, wine glasses in hand. The
      lantern light is softer here, more flattering, designed for the negotiations that
      happen in whispers. A skilled observer might notice how often powerful figures drift
      toward these corners, how many deals are sealed with a handshake in the shadows of

    visual_description: |
      When configured for ceremony, the pavilion's central nave becomes a formal hall. A low
      dais rises mid-leeward, its temporary platform anchored to the floor's recessed points.
      Rope stanchions on bronze posts create a shallow stage apron, separating performers from
      audience while maintaining the sense of shared space. The announcer's position is carefully
      chosen for acoustic projection—tested generations ago, marked on no official plan.

      The crystal lanterns have been arranged for this configuration, denser above the dais,
      softer in the audience space. Trestle tables along the side aisles hold refreshments
      and conversation pieces. The column grid creates natural viewing lanes—no matter where
      a guest stands, they have a clear sightline to the recognition stage.

    visual_description: |
      The pier at night is a study in controlled vulnerability. Lantern posts mark the passage
      at regular intervals, their light creating pools of visibility between stretches of
      shadow. The tarred oak planking shows the wear of countless ceremonial processions,
      but Thorne sees only the tactical truth: no cover, no side routes, no retreat except
      back to the city or into the harbor.

      The first security checkpoint appears at one-third distance—a lay-by niche where Watch
      screeners check invitations and assess arrivals. Beyond them, the chainable bollards
      wait, capable of halting any approach with a single command. The pavilion glows at the

      The pier at late night, after the lanterns have been extinguished. Only the pierhead

      their footsteps echoing on the tarred planks, their presence a reminder that access is
      never truly open.

      The pavilion beyond is a ghost of its evening glory—lanterns dark, marble catching only
      moonlight, the azure tiles invisible against the night sky. But the Watch remains,
      bound by duty or payment to guard whatever needs guarding. Their lanterns bob as they

      The effect is an office floating in the open air, privacy achieved through arrangement
      rather than walls. One canvas panel bears the seal of whatever organization claimed
      this space for the evening.

      The lantern light is carefully positioned—bright enough to read documents, soft enough
      for confidential conversation. Through the gaps between canvas panels, the party

      The Last Light Company stands on that platform, receiving the acknowledgment of
      Waterdeep's officials. Their faces show the careful neutrality of professionals

      The oiled canvas snaps and billows as it's secured to balustrade rings and column
      bases. Chains are laced through the copper gutters to prevent uplift. The transformation
