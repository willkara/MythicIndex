  narrative_soul: |
    The Azure Pavilion is a place where legitimacy is performed. It's a stage 
    floating between city and sea—open to the sky yet accessible only through 
    a single, controlled approach. Here, outsiders become recognized, contracts 
    become alliances, and wandering sellswords become an acknowledged company. 
    The pavilion doesn't create power; it displays it.
    
  one_line_essence: "A floating stage where legitimacy is conferred under azure skies"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "Formal recognition and entry into established power"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Threshold between outsider and accepted"
      - "Civic order imposed on natural chaos (sea, wind, weather)"
      - "Spectacle as political tool"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "openness vs. controlled access"
      - "natural beauty vs. constructed prestige"
      - "welcome vs. evaluation"
      - "belonging vs. being on display"

  transformation_arc: |
    For the Last Light Company, the Azure Pavilion marks a pivotal transformation—
    the moment they shifted from being tolerated to being formally acknowledged 
    within Waterdeep's political structure. The pavilion itself doesn't change; 
    rather, it's a crucible through which the Company's status is permanently 
    altered. What was once an alien venue of the elite becomes a place where 
    their legitimacy was publicly declared.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Classical civic ceremonial with maritime engineering"
  primary_materials:
    - "white marble paving and column cladding"
    - "azure-glazed ceramic roof tiles"
    - "seasoned oak and larch timber framing"
    - "copper ridge caps and gutters"
    - "bronze hardware and strapping"
    - "granite pile caps and stringers"
  scale_impression: "Grandly proportioned yet human-scaled; the 300-ft approach creates anticipation, the open colonnade feels expansive but the column grid maintains intimacy"
  
  visual_signature: |
    The defining image is the azure-glazed canopy floating above white marble, 
    with the harbor glittering beyond the balustrade. At dusk, the roof tiles 
    deepen from bright cerulean to twilight blue while enchanted crystal lanterns 
    bloom silver-white, their light doubling in the water below.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Constant undertone of lapping water against the piles; distant harbor bells 
    and halyard clatter; gull calls at the perimeter. During events, chamber 
    music and murmured conversation weave through the open bays. Wind creates 
    soft percussion in the truss bays overhead.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Clean salt air dominates, with notes of polished stone and occasional tar/pitch 
    from maintenance. During gatherings, perfumes and floral oils mingle with the 
    sea, creating an incongruous elegance.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Cool sea breeze constant on exposed skin; the marble underfoot is smooth but 
    slightly salt-satined near edges; wind chill can bite in shoulder seasons; 
    the air carries fine mist during weather.

  light_character: |
    Light behaves dramatically here. Midday sun dazzles off white marble, creating 
    sharp column shadows across the floor. The azure canopy diffuses and tints the 
    light beneath with a subtle blue cast. At dusk, the roof deepens in color while 
    the enchanted crystal lanterns create layered silver halos that reflect off both 
    marble and water—the pavilion becomes twice itself in reflection. Night brings 
    controlled pools of silver-white from the lanterns against the dark harbor.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Weather transforms the space utterly. Fair weather creates the signature 
    brilliance and maximum visibility. Wind activates the canvas windbreak system 
    and creates soft drumming in the trusses. Rain triggers the deep eaves and 
    copper gutters into musical drainage. Storm conditions can shrink the usable 
    space to leeward bays only, creating intimate pockets within the larger frame. 
    Fog wraps the pavilion in soft silence, erasing the city and leaving only 
    the immediate marble and the muffled lap of water.
  
contextual_place:
  region: "Dock Ward, Waterdeep"
  neighborhood_character: "Harbor district—working waterfront with commercial piers, warehouses, taverns. The Azure Pavilion stands apart from this chaos on its own pier, a deliberate island of civic elegance projecting into the harbor."
  
  approach_sequences:
    - name: "The Processional Pier"
      description: "300 feet of timber-and-stone pier stretching from the harbor district. Lantern posts at intervals, banner sockets for civic events, two widened lay-by niches for staging and security. The approach is deliberately long—a decompression chamber between city bustle and ceremonial space."
      first_impression: "The azure canopy dominates ahead, floating above white columns. The pier narrows perspective, focusing attention forward. The city falls away behind. Sound shifts from dock clamor to wind and water."
    - name: "From the Harbor (by water)"
      description: "Approaching by boat, the pavilion rises on its forest of piles, the azure roof catching light above the waterline. The marble balustrade creates a clean edge between structure and sea."
      first_impression: "A floating temple of civic order amid the working harbor's chaos."

  spatial_relationship: "The pavilion exists deliberately apart—connected to the city only by its pier umbilicus, surrounded by water on three sides. This isolation is both security feature and symbolic statement: to reach this space, you must traverse a threshold, leave the ordinary world behind."
