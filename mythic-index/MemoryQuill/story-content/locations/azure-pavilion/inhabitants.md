- Population Size: 0 permanent; event capacity typically 250–350 seated, 400–600 standing
- Typical Attendees: City officials, invited dignitaries, guild envoys, elite patrons, select mercantile representatives, recognized companies (e.g., Last Light Company)
- Oversight: City Watch provides approach control and event security; pavilion steward coordinates staffing and logistics
- Languages: Common, Illuskan, Chondathan; translators engaged ad hoc for foreign delegations

  - Security: Gate/chain test; queue lines set; bell and signals verified
- Event (T0 to T+3h):

## Notes
- No permanent residence; usage is episodic and by invitation
- Physical interaction emphasis: chokepoint approach, side-aisle service flows, leeward comfort zones with windbreaks, and emergency egress via service float
- Canon anchors: ch19 (gathering, open-air elegance, crystal lanterns, pier siting); ch20 (post-event context). Draft ch35 informs twilight atmosphere; roles above remain flexible and non-contradictory.
