# Azure Pavilion – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Set at the seaward terminus of a long civic pier projecting into Waterdeep Harbor, with uninterrupted views toward Mount Waterdeep and the open sea. The pier stands over tidally influenced saltwater with moderate swell, wind exposure from the west/southwest, and frequent salt spray. [FIRM: ch19; DRAFT: ch35]
- Site Advantages: Exceptional visibility and prestige; sea breezes provide natural cooling; water perimeter creates security standoff; controlled single-approach access along the pier; panoramic vistas enhance ceremony.
- Environmental Factors: High salt corrosion index; gusting winds and lateral loads; storm surge and king-tide events several times per year; gull and seabird activity; occasional fog banks rolling in from the harbor.
- Approach Routes: Primary access via a 300-foot timber-and-stone pier. Service access via a rope-and-pulley hoist and laddered side-steps to a low service float on the leeward (cityward) side. No public landward perimeter—approach is linear and easily controlled. [FIRM: ch19 implies single pier approach]

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Open-air ceremonial pavilion with classical civic influences: fluted columns, marble surfacing, broad low-pitch tiled roofs in alternating gables; Waterdeep decorative tradition with restrained ornamentation and symbolic use of color (azure roof as civic prestige). [FIRM: ch19; DRAFT: ch35]
- Primary Materials: 
  - Superstructure: Seasoned oak and larch beams/trusses; bronze straps and pegs at key joints.
  - Surfacing: White marble paving and column cladding; granite plinths; azure-glazed ceramic roof tiles; copper ridge caps and gutters; lead flashing.
  - Foundations: Oak piles with iron shoes; stone (granite) pile caps and stringers; tar/pitch waterproofing; hemp caulking.
- Construction Methods: Pile-supported deck with stone cap beams; mortise-and-tenon timber framing with bronze strapping; marble set over lime mortar bed atop granite stringers; glazed tile roof hung from timber trusses; leaded flashing and copper ridge for weatherproofing; bracing frames concealed within column lines.
- Overall Layout: Rectangular open plan approximately 100 ft (width) by 200 ft (length) on a 300 ft approach pier. Perimeter balustrade for edge protection; main floor broken into subtle bays by column grid; no enclosing walls to preserve views. [FIRM: ch19]

## Detailed Structural Analysis

### Main Pavilion Floor
- Dimensions & Scale: ~100 ft x 200 ft clear deck; capacity 400–600 persons standing, 250–350 seated (banquet configuration). Column grid on ~20 ft centers yields 6 x 10 bays.
- Construction Details: 
  - Flooring: 3–4 inch marble pavers over lime bedding on granite stringers; stringers borne by oak sills that rest on stone pile caps.
  - Columns: Slender fluted drums (marble-clad timber cores) seated on granite plinth blocks keyed to the deck; bronze dowels resist uplift.
  - Balustrade: Waist-high marble with carved wave and knot motifs; bronze stanchions at corners for removable lantern poles and windbreak curtains.
- Layout Configuration: Central nave-like run with side aisles defined by column lines; open circulation loop along the balustrade; anchor points recessed into floor for dais, trestle tables, orchestra platform, and rope stanchions.
- Distinctive Features: 
  - Lantern hardpoints at every other bay (discreet bronze rings) for enchanted crystal lanterns. [FIRM: ch19; DRAFT: ch35]
  - Inset storm channels crossing the deck diagonally toward scupper boxes.
- Physical Condition: Marble highly polished; minor salt etching near edges; periodic repointing of joints due to thermal cycling and salt intrusion.

### Roof Canopy
- Dimensions & Scale: Multi-gable canopy spanning the full footprint; eaves projecting 6–8 ft to deflect spray and rain.
- Construction Details: 
  - Trusses: Larch king-post trusses with oak tie-beams; scarf joints with bronze fishplates; hidden diagonal knee-braces; tie-rods in bronze to resist racking.
  - Tiles: Azure-glazed ceramic tiles (double-lap) on oak battens; copper ridge with finials; lead flashing at hips and eaves; drip edges to copper gutters.
- Layout Configuration: Alternating gable runs aligned with column bays; louvers near the ridge to purge heat and salt mist; removable canvas windbreaks that hook to eave rings during storms.
- Distinctive Features: Azure tiles deepen to twilight hues at dusk, echoing the harbor’s chroma. [DRAFT: ch35]
- Physical Condition: Excellent; roof re-glazed in recent years; routine replacement of corroded bronze fixings.

### Pier Approach
- Dimensions & Scale: ~300 ft length, 18–24 ft width; sufficient for paired processions or wagon service.
- Construction Details: 
  - Decking: Thick oak planks pegged and tarred; cross-braced with diagonal timbers below.
  - Foundations: Dense grid of oak piles on ~10–12 ft centers; iron-shod tips driven into harbor bed; granite caps bound with pitch.
  - Edge Protection: Bollards and mooring rings; lantern posts at intervals; removable ceremonial banners.
- Layout Configuration: Gentle crown to shed water; slip-resistant scoring; two widened lay-by niches for staging and security checks.
- Distinctive Features: Ceremonial banner sockets and lamp stanchions; chainable bollards to halt approach when required.
- Physical Condition: Weathered but well-maintained; periodic plank replacement; tar reapplication pre-storm season. [FIRM: ch19]

### Service Undercroft (Sub-Deck and Utility Run)
- Dimensions & Scale: 3–5 ft crawl space tapering toward edges; accessible via lockable hatch near the dais bay and ladder at the pier head.
- Construction Details: Conduit trays for lantern fuel caches (if used), rope and pulley hoist lines, spare storm-curtain rolls, and sand casks for ballast and fire.
- Layout Configuration: Linear utility run along central spine; tie-offs for maintenance crews; drip trays under gutter downspouts to intercept salt before discharge.
- Distinctive Features: Bronze lightning down-straps routed along interior column lines into the water for safe dissipation.
- Physical Condition: Salt-crusted surfaces; inspected quarterly; tight clearances require small crew rotations.

### Exterior Spaces
- Courtyards & Plazas: None landward; the pier itself functions as a ceremonial processional with staging niches at 1/3 and 2/3 length.
- Defensive Works: Natural moat-effect by water; chokepoint at pierhead gate; removable chain barriers; concealed belaying pins that can drop slip-lines to obstruct sprinting approach.
- Gardens & Grounds: N/A; floral decor via movable planters and garlands during festivities.
- Utility Areas: 
  - Service Float: A low, tethered raft on the leeward side for barge deliveries, refuse removal, and emergency egress.
  - Shore-Side Stores: Non-permanent staging sheds at the dock origin for catering, linens, and windbreak canvas.

## Physical Systems & Infrastructure

### Structural Engineering
- Foundation Systems: 
  - Primary: Oak piles in grid; iron shoes for penetration; raked piles at perimeter resist lateral wind/swell.
  - Pile Caps: Granite blocks mortared with lime and pitch; oak sill beams bolted through with bronze.
  - Drainage: Deck crowned; marble deck scuppers feed copper downspouts to spill points timed with ebbing tide; silt baskets recover debris.
- Load-Bearing Elements: Column lines under truss seats; bronze tie-rods reduce thrust; knee-braces resist racking from crosswind gusts.
- Roofing Systems: Azure tile double-lap on battens; copper ridge and lead flashings; wind clamps on eaves courses; removable storm-curtain anchors along eaves.
- Connections & Joints: Mortise-and-tenon with bronze pins at critical nodes; scarf joints with fishplates; expansion gaps at marble field with lead-and-lime infill.

### Environmental Controls
- Heating & Ventilation: No built hearths; thermal comfort by sea breeze and stack effect through ridge louvers; winter curtains (oiled canvas) can enclose leeward bays to create microclimates.
- Lighting Systems: 
  - Primary: Enchanted crystal lanterns suspended from ring points (soft silver-white photomancy) [FIRM: ch19].
  - Secondary: Oil lamps for maintenance and redundancy; fuel stored in sealed bronze canisters in a lockable chest at the pier head.
- Water Management: 
  - Potable: Casks brought by barge or hand cart; limited on-site storage in lidded barrels beneath dais.
  - Waste: Greywater captured and staged, then released on outgoing tide via screened scuppers; food waste sealed in lidded bins and removed by service float; strict “no discharge” during incoming tide to prevent harbor fouling.
- Climate Protection: 
  - Wind: Removable canvas windbreaks; rope lacing to balustrade rings; weighted hems.
  - Rain: Deep eaves; copper gutters with chained downspouts; canvas ceiling liners can be rigged between trusses for heavy downpours.
  - Lightning: Copper ridge lightning finial bonded to bronze straps terminating at water line.

### Security & Access
- Entry Control: 
  - Pierhead Gate: Lockable wrought-iron double gate with side wickets; posted watch during events.
  - Barrier System: Removable chain between bollards; rope stanchions for queuing; identity and invitation checks at first lay-by niche.
- Observation Points: 
  - Natural Lines: Long pier approach offers 300 ft observation; lantern posts illuminate approach at night.
  - Elevated Vantage: Truss catwalk maintenance points serve as ad hoc observation perches (access-controlled).
- Emergency Systems:
  - Egress: Side ladder to service float; lifebuoys and coiled lines on balustrade posts; luminous paint ticks to mark ladder at night.
  - Alarm: Bell at pierhead; signal flags for harbor patrol; lantern flash-codes known to Watch.
- Defensive Features: Water perimeter and chokepoint create inherent defense; storm-curtain rigging can become smoke baffles if needed; sand casks for incipient fire suppression.

## Immersive Sensory Environment

### Visual Landscape
- Dominant Visual Elements: White marble plane, colonnades, and continuous azure canopy; silver-white lantern halos mirrored in the water. [FIRM: ch19; DRAFT: ch35]
- Material Textures: Salt-satined marble near edges, fine fluting on columns, glazed tile sheen, verdigris kisses on copper ridges.
- Color Palette: White stone, deep azure roof, polished bronze, weathered oak, sea greens and silvers.
- Light & Shadow: Dappled patterns from roof bays; low sun casts long column shadows; at night lanterns create layered, moving reflections across the deck.

### Acoustic Environment
- Sound Reflection: Open-air reduces echo; columns add a soft rhythmic return; truss bays lightly drum in gusts.
- Noise Sources: Lapping water, gull calls, distant harbor bells, halyard clatter; event nights add strings, soft horns, and chamber voices.
- Acoustic Zones: Quieter at the leeward edge and under mid-bays; lively along windward balustrade; approach pier carries sound forward like a speaking tube.
- Communication: Normal conversation workable except in high wind; announcer’s dais placed mid-leeward bay for optimal projection.

### Environmental Atmosphere
- Air Quality: Clean, saline air; occasional pitch and hemp scent from maintenance; perfumes drift during gatherings. [FIRM: ch19; DRAFT: ch35]
- Scent Profiles: Sea spray, polished stone, tar pitch, linen and floral oils during events.
- Physical Comfort: Cool breezes; notable wind chill in shoulder seasons; canvas windbreaks make leeward bays comfortable for dining.
- Weather Response: Eaves and gutters manage rain; storm curtains transform space into a sheltered arcade; fog wraps the pavilion in soft silence.

## Temporal & Seasonal Variations

### Daily Environmental Changes
- Morning Transformation: Pale light catches dew on tiles; gulls claim the balustrade; maintenance checks occur.
- Midday Character: Marble dazzles; breezes peak; sun-sails (if rigged) throw crisp lattice shadows.
- Evening Atmosphere: Azure tiles deepen to twilight blues; enchanted lanterns bloom silver over the water; the city sparkles behind. [DRAFT: ch35]
- Night Configuration: Security lighting at pierhead and lantern posts; side float ladder marked; windbreaks deployed if gusts rise.

### Seasonal Adaptations
- Spring Renewal: Festive banners; fresh pitch work; windbreaks used intermittently; sea scents clean and bright. [FIRM: timeline anchors ch19–ch22]
- Summer Peak: Full open-air operation; maximum capacity events; sail awnings sometimes rigged between gables.
- Autumn Preparation: Increased gusts; canvas kept at the ready; gutter and scupper cleaning focus; marble joints repointed before storms.
- Winter Protection: Frequent windbreak enclosure on leeward bays; reduced capacities; more reliance on oil lamps and thick linens.

### Weather Response Patterns
- Fair Weather: Brilliant spectacle; maximum visibility; best acoustics for music and oration.
- Storms: Storm curtains down; tie-offs engaged; downspouts chained; event either reduced in footprint (leeward bays) or postponed.
- Extreme Weather: Evacuation to shore via controlled queues; non-essential gear lowered to service float; lightning protocol enacted; Watch notified.
