  Cid's workshop is not a building—it is a nervous system. When Cid is
  curious, the prototypes click and hum with eager energy. When she is
  joyful, Unit 7 pours drinks with theatrical precision and the
  conduits sing with steady light. When she learns her masterpiece has
  been perverted into a children's prison, the workshop convulses: tools
  rattle on pegboards, lightning arcs from conduit to conduit, and her
  augmented fist shatters a workbench that has survived decades. This is
  a space where creation is identity—and when the work is corrupted, the
  maker bleeds through the building itself.

one_line_essence: "Where genius creates, and grief makes the walls scream."
