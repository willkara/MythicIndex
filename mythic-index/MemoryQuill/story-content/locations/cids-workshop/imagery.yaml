    This workshop is Cid herself made manifest in wood, metal, and wire. It
    breathes with her energy, clutters with her thoughts, and bleeds when her
    work is betrayed. The space responds to her emotional state through
    sympathetic resonance—tools vibrating on pegboards, conduits flaring,
    prototypes chirping in alarm. It welcomes visitors with fizzy drinks and
    delights them with wonders, but it can turn deadly in an instant when
    its creator's fury rides the conduits like lightning.

  category: exterior

  scene_mood: celebratory
  mood_rationale: |
    The establishing shot captures the workshop at its best—a joyful chaos
    of creativity before tragedy. This is Cid's domain as she knows it:
    brilliant, welcoming, alive with possibility.

  visual_description: |
    A practical storefront on Castle Ward's artisan row, the workshop's
    exterior is unassuming stone and timber, but the interior visible
    through the front windows hints at the chaos within. Blueprints are
    visible even from outside, tacked to frames. A faint blue glow from
    arcane conduits plays through the glass. A hand-painted sign shows
    gears and lightning bolts. The street is cobbled, the neighboring
    precision workshops quiet in comparison.

  composition_notes: |
    Wide establishing shot from across the street, capturing the full
    storefront. The practical stone facade contrasted with glimpses of
    chaotic interior through windows. Morning light from behind camera,
    warming the limestone. Depth suggested by the receding artisan row.

  narrative_significance: |
    This is where Cid creates her wonders and where her masterpiece will
    be revealed as a monster. The exterior's modesty conceals the
    explosive creativity within.

    Practical limestone storefront with large windows, morning sunlight
    warming the stone. Through the windows, glimpses of chaotic interior:
    blueprints visible, faint blue arcane glow from conduits. Hand-painted
    sign with gear and lightning bolt motif above door. Cobbled street,
    neighboring precision workshops receding uphill. Wide angle from across
    street. Spring morning light, clear air. Subtle fantasy grounding:
    ward-marks on doorframe, guild seal near handle. No people. Waterdeep
    Castle Ward artisan architecture.

      workbench dominates the center, tools laid out but not in use.
      Conduits hum at low power, blue glow subdued. The clerestory
      light falls in dusty bands across empty floor space.

    visual_description: |
      The heavy oak workbench lies in ruins, exploded outward from a
      central impact point. Splinters and half-assembled gadgets are
      scattered across the floor. Small fires burn where arcane sparks
      landed on oil-soaked rags. Blueprints drift in the air like falling
      leaves. Cid stands at the center, small and terrible, her prosthetic
      arm still crackling with residual energy, her copper hair lifted
      by static charge. Unit 7 has recoiled on its mounting. The conduits
      along the walls flare white-hot.

      Medium shot, camera at Cid's height, facing her amid the wreckage.
      The destroyed workbench as focal point of violence. Small fires

      The blueprints are Cid's memory made visible—layer upon layer of
      plans, notes, and iterations. This is ordinary for her, extraordinary
      for visitors.

    visual_description: |
      Walls, cabinet faces, and even hanging lines are covered in layered
      blueprints, some yellowed with age, others fresh with wet chalk
      annotations. Pins and clips hold the chaos in some semblance of
      order. Chalk notes in Cid's cramped handwriting annotate margins,
      cross-reference other plans, argue with past versions. Small
      sketches of mechanical components share space with full structural
      diagrams. The archive grows outward like a living thing.

        description: "Focus on workshop elements, not people"

    scene_mood: ominous
    mood_rationale: |
      The wrongness of a space responding to emotional trauma—the
      workshop becoming dangerous as its creator's fury rides the
      conduits.

    visual_description: |
      The workshop in sympathetic distress: tools vibrating against
      their pegboard hooks, some fallen to the floor. Arcane conduits
      flaring brilliant blue-white, casting harsh shadows. Unit 7's
      joints locked into aggressive angles. The clockwork bird on its
      shelf, beak open in mid-chirp. Static charge visible in the air.
      Small objects trembling. The smell of ozone would be overwhelming.

    composition_notes: |
      Wide shot capturing multiple resonance effects. No people—focus
      on the workshop's distress. Harsh conduit lighting. Movement
      implied in vibration. The space itself in crisis.

      Artificer's workshop in sympathetic distress—NO PEOPLE. Tools
      vibrating on pegboards, some fallen. Arcane conduits flaring
      brilliant blue-white along walls, casting harsh shadows. Multi-
