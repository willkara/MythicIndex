creatures:
  - name: Spark Sprite
    description: Tiny fey creatures born from magical sparks and electrical discharges in the workshop. They're drawn to Cidri's enchanting work and help stabilize magic items in exchange for the thrill of raw magical energy. Mischievous but ultimately helpful.
    visual_aspects:
      - Humanoid forms no larger than a thumb, glowing with inner lightning
      - Appear as miniature figures made of crackling electricity
      - Hair stands on end in corona of sparks
      - Leave small scorch marks and ozone smell where they touch
      - Move in jerky, energetic bursts like living static
    habitat:
      where: Near enchanting workbench, magical equipment, and charged items
      when: Most active during active enchanting; dormant when workshop is inactive
      why: Feed on ambient magical energy; drawn to creative magical work
    behavior:
      who: Small colony of 5-8 individuals living in the workshop's electrical systems
      what: Help stabilize enchantments by grounding excess energy
      how: Absorb magical overcharges that would otherwise cause failures
    lore: Cidri talks to them constantly while working, treating them as assistants. They seem to understand and respond—enchantments rarely fail when the Sprites are active and attentive. She leaves small dishes of copper filings and silver dust for them, which they somehow "eat" by absorbing the conductive properties.

  - name: Blueprint Mite
    description: Nearly microscopic insects that live in and feed on technical drawings and schematics. They don't destroy the documents but instead memorize them, creating a living library. Cidri has learned to "read" them to recall old designs she's forgotten.
    visual_aspects:
      - Barely visible to naked eye; clusters visible as faint shimmer on paper
      - Under magnification, appear as crystalline insects
      - Leave no damage but faint iridescent trails on frequently read plans
      - Colonies create specific patterns based on drawing complexity
      - Glow very faintly under magical light
    habitat:
      where: Drawing storage, active worktables, and archived technical documents
      when: Constantly present; population grows with new designs
      why: Feed on information itself—the more complex the design, the more nutritious
    behavior:
      who: Massive colonies numbering in millions throughout workshop
      what: Memorize and preserve technical information
      how: Collective memory allows design retrieval through mite behavior patterns
    lore: When Cidri needs an old schematic she can't find, she sprinkles sugar on blank parchment near the mite colonies. They swarm the sugar and, somehow, arrange themselves into visible approximations of the remembered design. It's not perfect, but it's saved dozens of old designs from being lost forever.

  - name: Tool Familiar
    description: Enchanted tools that have developed rudimentary awareness from years of skilled use. They're not fully intelligent but respond to Cidri's needs, floating within reach at the right moments or nudging her attention to problems she's overlooked.
    visual_aspects:
      - Various workshop tools showing unusual wear patterns
      - Handles warm to touch, as if recently used
      - Sometimes move slightly when not being watched
      - Favorite or most-used tools show faint aura to magical sight
      - Perfectly balanced despite apparent wear
    habitat:
      where: Scattered throughout workshop; return to specific homes when not needed
      when: Active during work hours; settle to rest when Cidri closes shop
      why: Manifestation of craftsperson's connection with their tools
    behavior:
      who: Approximately 15-20 tools with varying degrees of awareness
      what: Position themselves conveniently; draw attention to issues
      how: Gentle empathic bond with primary user (Cidri)
    lore: Other craftspeople notice but rarely comment—it's considered poor form to mention another artisan's Tool Familiars. They're proof of true mastery and deep connection to craft. Cidri's favorite hammer has been "helping" for fifteen years. It's never where she left it, but always where she needs it to be.

  - name: Scrap Golem
    description: A small construct that assembles itself from workshop waste and failed experiments. Not intentionally created, it emerged spontaneously from accumulated magical residue. It "helps" by organizing scraps, though its idea of organization doesn't always match Cidri's.
    visual_aspects:
      - Roughly humanoid shape about 2 feet tall
      - Body constantly shifts as it incorporates new scrap materials
      - Core appears to be an accidentally enchanted gear assembly
      - Moves with jerky, uncertain motions
      - One eye made from a cracked enchanting lens, the other from a button
    habitat:
      where: Workshop floor, especially near scrap piles and failed project storage
      when: Active during closed hours; freezes when directly observed
      why: Unknown; possibly trying to help or just following compulsion to organize
    behavior:
      who: Single entity, though composition changes constantly
      what: Sorts scrap by unknown criteria; builds small sculptures from waste
      how: Disassembles and reassembles itself using available materials
    lore: Cidri first noticed it three years ago when scrap piles started organizing themselves overnight. She's never seen it move—it freezes perfectly still when watched. She's developed a habit of thanking it aloud for its help and leaving interesting broken pieces out as "gifts." The next morning, they're always incorporated into its body or used in its mysterious scrap sculptures.
