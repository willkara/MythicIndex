# Cidrella Vexweld’s Workshop – Physical Description

## Site & Building
- **Setting**: A workshop on the Castle Ward’s artisan row, among precision workshops and specialty houses—reached by angling uphill from the Dock Ward.
- **Exterior Read**: Practical storefront scale, built for function over display.

## Interior Layout (Functional Zones)
- **Entry / Client Threshold**: A narrow clearing for greeting, set against the chaos beyond; a place to be charmed before the hazards start.
- **Central Work Floor**: Benches arranged around a primary heavy oak workbench; projects in various stages occupy every horizontal surface (e.g., a clockwork crab for sewer maintenance, a device that claims to translate plant emotions).
- **Meeting / Meal Nook**: A “relatively clear” patch around a sturdy workbench where visitors can stand or perch to eat and talk without brushing live work.
- **Blueprint Surfaces**: Plans pinned to walls, cabinet faces, and even hanging lines; chalk annotations build a living archive.
- **Tool Walls**: Pegboards with hanging tools and parts—calm in normal conversation, but prone to vibrating under heavy emotional/arcane load.
- **Power & Conduit Runs**: Arcane conduits snake along walls and beams, feeding work lights and prototype rigs; the hum rises when the shop is active.
- **Domestic Corner**: A local lightning-lime fizz station and mismatched cups—comfort embedded in the workflow. Unit 7 serves as both tool and companion.
- **Prototype Shelves**: Cluttered perches for half-assembled mechanisms (including a clockwork bird that can chirp frantically when alarmed).

## Materials & Texture
- Oiled wood, scorched metal, and resin-coated housings; cable bundles tied with quick knots rather than elegant routing.
- Floors worn by constant pivoting and pacing; scattered filings and the occasional dropped screw that always finds a boot.

## Sensory Environment
- **Smell**: Ozone, hot metal, machine oil, and a faint citrus-lime fizz.
- **Sound**: Rhythmic clicking of half-finished mechanisms; a steady electrical hum under conversation.
- **Light**: Task lighting in bright islands; the rest of the shop lives in warm shadow and blueprint pale.

## Adjacent Space: “The Annex”
- A chaotic two-story annex/quarters connected to the main workshop by a clanking metal door.
- Ground floor: a secondary bench dedicated to private, higher-risk experiments—often even more cluttered than the main shop.
- Upper loft: a narrow sleeping nook reached by a rickety, oil-stained spiral stair, surrounded by humming conduits and pinned plans.

## Safety Notes (In-World)
- The shop can go from “welcoming” to “dangerous” instantly when emotion spikes and power surges ride the conduits: static in the air, sudden arcs, vibrating tools, and autonomous equipment shifting into protective/attack-ready angles.
- When Cid’s augmented strength and arcane output spike, heavy furniture can become shrapnel (including the primary oak workbench).
