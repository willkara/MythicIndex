  visual_description: "A soaring, wide-angle establishing shot of Cid's workshop, housed in a \nmassive, nave-like stone warehouse. The ceiling rises over thirty feet to \nheavy queen-post timber trusses, where thick 'vines' of copper and leather \nconduits pulse with a constant arcane violet heartbeat. \n\nThe expansive floor is a labyrinth of industry: several large-scale work \nbenches are spaced across the wide timber planks, each surrounded by a \n'beautiful mess' of crates, copper coils, and discarded vellum. The walls \nare an immense archaeology of blueprints, reaching up toward the high, \nnarrow clerestory windows. \n\nCidrella Vexweld, her copper-red braids bright against the stone, is a \ndynamic spark of motion at the central weirwood workbench. Assistants move \nbetween the distant side-stations, their small forms emphasizing the \nhall's cathedral-like volume. The air is hazy with ozone and the golden \nglow of floating magelight crystals.\n"
