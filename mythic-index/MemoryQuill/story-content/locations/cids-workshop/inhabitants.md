# Cidrella Vexweld’s Workshop – Inhabitants

## Primary
- **Cidrella “Cid” Vexweld**: Resident artificer and engineer; the shop’s rhythms match her: fast, bright, and rarely quiet.

## Secondary Presence
- **Unit 7 (Mechanical Helper Arm)**: A multi-jointed metal arm with “hospitality protocols” (pouring a local fizzy drink) that can instantly shift into an aggressive “attack configuration” in response to Cid’s distress.
- **Clients & Couriers**: Specialty orders, supplier deliveries, and occasional guild-adjacent visitors.

## On-Site Projects (Seen in Chapter 33)
- **Clockwork Crab Prototype**: Designed to clean sewer pipes; treated like a practical miracle in progress.
- **Plant-Emotion “Translator”**: A device that claims to read a houseplant’s emotional state.
- **Half-Assembled Clockwork Bird**: A shelf-perched mechanism that can react noisily when the workshop is alarmed.

## Story-Relevant Visitors
- Members of the Last Light Company during Chapter 33 (Veyra Thornwake, Marcus Heartbridge, Grimjaw Ironbeard, Thorne Brightward, Lyra Kestrel), when Cid learns her work has been weaponized.
