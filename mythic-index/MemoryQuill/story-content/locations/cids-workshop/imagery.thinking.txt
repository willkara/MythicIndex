This is a request to create location imagery specifications for Cid's Workshop based on the provided analysis and source files. Let me work through this systematically.

**Understanding the Location:**
- Cid's Workshop is an artificer's workshop in Castle Ward, Waterdeep
- It's a character-defining space - "Cid externalized"
- Key narrative moment: Chapter 33 where Cid learns her work has been weaponized, leading to emotional breakdown and destruction of the oak workbench
- Central duality: hospitality and hostility coexisting (Unit 7 embodies this)

**Key Visual Elements to Anchor:**
1. Blueprint-layered walls with chalk annotations
2. Heavy oak workbench (destroyed in Ch33)
3. Unit 7 - multi-jointed metal arm (hospitality/attack dual configuration)
4. Arcane conduits running along walls and beams
5. Tool pegboards (vibrate under emotional load)
6. Lightning-lime fizz station with mismatched cups
7. Clockwork crab prototype
8. Half-assembled clockwork bird
9. Task lighting creating bright islands
10. The Annex with clanking metal door and spiral stair to sleeping loft

**Materials:**
- Oiled wood (worn, scorched in places)
- Metal (scorched, resin-coated housings)
- Cable bundles (quick-tied, functional)
- Worn floor from constant pacing

**Color Anchors:**
- Ozone blue from conduits
- Warm amber from task lighting
- Blueprint pale (cream/white)
- Oiled wood amber/brown
- Metal silver/gunmetal with patina
- Citrus-lime green from the fizz

**Light Character:**
- Task lighting creates bright islands
- Warm shadow otherwise
- Blueprint pale dimness
- Conduit glow (especially during emotional spikes)

**Images to Create (based on recommendations):**


I'll capture the workshop's intimate creative essence, focusing on the personal space where innovation breathes. The establishing image will reveal the workshop's raw energy - a moment of pure creative potential, where half-formed inventions and scattered blueprints speak to Cid's passionate, intricate process of making. The mood will be intimate, revealing the quiet poetry of personal creative space, with light dancing across unfinished prototypes and chalk-marked walls.

Unit 7 emerges within this charged atmosphere, serving lightning-lime fizz in a tender, domestic gesture that connects technology and human warmth. The interaction feels personal, almost whispered.

A sympathetic resonance pulses through the workshop - the space itself seems to respond to emotional shifts, with diagonal lines of urgent motion cutting through harsh light. The environment becomes dramatically alive, tracking every internal fluctuation.

After destruction, a somber mood settles - melancholy hanging in the air like dust motes, revealing the delicate aftermath of intense creative work.

Cid inhabits this space with profound intimacy, her focus creating a quiet poetry of connection. Blueprint walls and prototype collections become extensions of her inner landscape, oscillating between celebratory energy and tender personal reflection.

The visual composition will dynamically shift - establishing wide shots in expansive landscape ratios, then narrowing to intimate 3:2 frames that capture the nuanced emotional terrain of this technological sanctuary.
