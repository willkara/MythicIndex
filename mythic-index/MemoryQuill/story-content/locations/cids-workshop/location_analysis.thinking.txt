Let me analyze this location carefully using the framework provided.

## Location: Cid's Workshop

I need to analyze this through the five dimensions:
1. Physical Truth - What literally exists
2. Narrative Soul - What this place is ABOUT
3. Character Bonds - Who belongs here and how
4. Temporal States - How it changes
5. Contextual Place - Where it sits in the world

Let me work through each dimension systematically.

### Physical Truth
From the description:
- Castle Ward, artisan row - upslope from Dock Ward
- Practical storefront scale
- Interior zones: Entry threshold, Central work floor (heavy oak workbench - destroyed Ch33), Meeting/Meal nook, Blueprint surfaces, Tool walls (pegboards), Power/Conduit runs, Domestic corner (lightning-lime fizz), Prototype shelves
- The Annex: two-story connected space - ground floor secondary bench, upper loft sleeping nook via rickety spiral stair
- Materials: Oiled wood, scorched metal, resin-coated housings, cable bundles
- Sensory: Ozone, hot metal, machine oil, citrus-lime fizz / rhythmic clicking, electrical hum / task lighting in bright islands, warm shadow elsewhere

### Narrative Soul
This is where Cid IS herself. The workshop IS Cid externalized.
- First appearance Ch33 "An Architect's Honor"
- The pivotal moment: her work has been weaponized/perverted
- "Creation as identity—when the work is corrupted, the maker bleeds"
- The sympathetic resonance - workshop responds to her emotions

### Character Bonds
- Cid is the primary - the space matches her rhythms
- Unit 7 is both tool and companion
- The Last Light Company visits in Ch33 for the recruitment/reveal
- Projects have personality (clockwork crab, plant emotion translator)

### Temporal States
- Normal state: creative chaos, welcoming


- Emotional spike state: intense transformation occurs when Cid's feelings surge
- Dramatic shift after Chapter 33 reveals deep emotional and physical disruption

### Contextual Place
Situated in a complex urban ecosystem:
- Nestled in Castle Ward's artisan row
- Proximity to Korrath Threnx's structured environment creates fascinating contrast
- Interconnected with Dock Ward's broader industrial network
- Represents a unique creative nexus bridging multiple urban zones

I've mapped the workshop's zones as living, breathing spaces:
1. Entry/Client Threshold - Gateway of potential
2. Central Work Floor - Pulse of innovation
3. Meeting/Meal Nook - Intersection of personal and professional
4. Blueprint Surfaces - Realm of imagination
5. Tool Walls - Memory and potential embodied
6. Power/Conduit Runs - Invisible energy pathways
7. Domestic Corner - Intimate refuge
8. Prototype Shelves - Nascent possibilities
9. Annex Ground Floor - High-risk experimentation zone
10. Annex Loft - Personal sanctuary

The entire workshop breathes as a dynamic FORGE environment, each zone pulsing with unique energy.

Unit 7 emerges as a profound symbol of transformation - simultaneously welcoming and threatening, embodying hospitality and potential violence.

Visual narrative highlights:
1. Explosive creative moment
2. Mechanical shifts between states
3. Sympathetic resonance of environment
4. Aftermath of intense emotional release
5. Cid's mastery amidst chaos
