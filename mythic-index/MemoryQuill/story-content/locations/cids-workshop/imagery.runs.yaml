        SCENARIO: nave-like stone hall with 30ft+ ceilings, heavy timber trusses laced with pulsing violet conduits, expansive timber floor with multiple work islands, high clerestory windows casting narrow light shafts, Cidrella: rock-gnome, small in the vast space, archaeological layers of blueprints covering massive walls, floating magelight crystals providing localized pools of gold, no robots—large-scale mechanisms of bronze and wood, archeological walls: layers of vellum blueprints and architectural schematics pinned over every massive stone surface, arcane vines: thick, trunk-like bundles of copper wire and leather snaking along 30ft rafters like ivy, Unit 7: a massive multi-jointed arm of polished weirwood and etched bronze with glowing violet runic joints, the prosthetic: Cid's own arm as a masterpiece of arcane conduits and silver-solder alloy, harmonic dampeners: small spinning bronze disks that create a constant, soothing hum, charged quartz filters: crystalline structures integrated into high ventilation ducts, glowing with static fields, lightning-lime fizz station: condensation-beaded ceramic carafes and mismatched clay mugs, rock-gnome scale: furniture and stools sized for gnomes, making the massive hall feel even larger, Cidrella Vexweld is curled up in a massive, high-backed gnomish wooden chair in the corner of her mezzanine sanctuary. She is barefoot, her gnomish toes resting on a pile of discarded parchment. Her copper-red braids are loose and messy. She is holding a chipped clay mug of steaming fizz, staring thoughtfully over the railing at the vast workshop below—a silent forest of conduits and mechanisms in shadow. The only light is the deep blue twilight from the high clerestory windows and the soft, fading amber glow of the fizz station. The air is quiet, the 'rhythmic clicking' slowed to a drowsy crawl., Cid in profile, tucked into her chair on the mezzanine. The background should suggest the vastness of the hall through layers of silhouette and distant violet pulses. Low-key, moody lighting emphasizing the transition from work to rest., twilight, light from twilight and fading amber glow, cool blue mixed with warm drowsy amber, dominant colors: twilight blue, deep mahogany, copper-red hair; accent colors: steam white, amber ember, classical oil painting, Rembrandt lighting, chiaroscuro, visible brushwork, matte finish, 19th century romantic realism, materials: living weirwood, dark polished mahogany, and singed oak, silver-solder alloy, rose copper, etched bronze, and cold iron, damp granite walls of a massive warehouse nave, in the style of a classical oil painting, slight impasto texture, digital fantasy concept art, highly detailed, matte painting, heavy shadows, chiaroscuro lighting, Rembrandt lighting, volumetric atmosphere, muted earth tones, gritty realism, 19th-century portraiture style, sharp focus on subject, painterly background, interior view, volumetric lighting, god rays through dusty windows, atmospheric perspective, in the style of Dutch Golden Age painting, intricate architectural details, stone and wood textures, muted color palette, sepia undertone, storytelling composition, in the style of Greg Rutkowski, John Singer Sargent, Rembrandt, expressive face, distinct facial features, cinematic lighting, medium shot, thick brushwork, matte finish, dramatic side lighting, deep shadows, warm golden tones, detailed texture on metal and cloth, in the style of a classical oil painting, slight impasto texture, digital fantasy concept art, highly detailed, matte painting, heavy shadows, chiaroscuro lighting, Rembrandt lighting, volumetric atmosphere, muted earth tones, gritty realism, 19th-century portraiture style, sharp focus on subject, painterly background, Art by Greg Rutkowski, John Singer Sargent, Rembrandt

        SCENARIO: Unit 7: arm of mahogany, etched bronze, and leather, glowing violet runes at the joints, ceramic carafe pouring glowing green fizz, mismatched clay mugs on a stained tray, no sci-fi/robot elements, A close-up of Unit 7's arm in the domestic corner. The construct is a masterpiece of gnomish engineering: dark, polished mahogany segments bound together by etched bronze plates and reinforced leather straps. Violet runes glow at the joints, pulsing with the soft rhythm of a heartbeat. The bronze-fingered hand is mid-pour, delicately tilting a ceramic carafe of lightning-lime fizz. The vibrant green liquid is effervescent, sending up tiny glowing bubbles. A tray of mismatched clay mugs, some bearing hand-painted Company sigils, sits on a nearby stool. The background features soft-focus vellum plans and the warm glow of a floating crystal., Tight shot on the arm and the carafe. Emphasize the tactile contrast between the rough leather, the cold bronze, and the warm polished wood. The violet runic glow should provide the edge lighting., light from nearby magelight crystal, warm, localized, intimate, side-lit to emphasize texture, dominant colors: polished mahogany, etched bronze, arcane violet (runes); accent colors: lime green (fizz), terracotta (mugs), high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: living weirwood, dark polished mahogany, and singed oak, silver-solder alloy, rose copper, etched bronze, and cold iron, damp granite walls of a massive warehouse nave, Mood intent: Unit 7 is not a machine; it's a companion of wood and spirit. This scene captures the domestic warmth of the workshop, showing how Cid's genius serves her friends.

        4. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.


        SCENARIO: nave-like stone hall with 30ft+ ceilings, heavy timber trusses laced with pulsing violet conduits, expansive timber floor with multiple work islands, high clerestory windows casting narrow light shafts, Cidrella: rock-gnome, small in the vast space, archaeological layers of blueprints covering massive walls, floating magelight crystals providing localized pools of gold, no robots—large-scale mechanisms of bronze and wood, archeological walls: layers of vellum blueprints and architectural schematics pinned over every massive stone surface, arcane vines: thick, trunk-like bundles of copper wire and leather snaking along 30ft rafters like ivy, Unit 7: a massive multi-jointed arm of polished weirwood and etched bronze with glowing violet runic joints, the prosthetic: Cid's own arm as a masterpiece of arcane conduits and silver-solder alloy, harmonic dampeners: small spinning bronze disks that create a constant, soothing hum, charged quartz filters: crystalline structures integrated into high ventilation ducts, glowing with static fields, lightning-lime fizz station: condensation-beaded ceramic carafes and mismatched clay mugs, rock-gnome scale: furniture and stools sized for gnomes, making the massive hall feel even larger, A cluttered perch of prototypes—the clockwork crab mid-assembly, lacking a leg, gears visible through open housing. The half-assembled clockwork bird on its stand, beak parted as if about to chirp. Dust patterns reveal which have been touched recently., light from high clerestory windows and floating crystals, dramatic light shafts in a voluminous space, volumetric ozone haze and metallic dust, dominant colors: stone grey (walls), arcane violet (conduits), warm timber amber; accent colors: copper-red (hair), citrus green (fizz), ink indigo, high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: living weirwood, dark polished mahogany, and singed oak, silver-solder alloy, rose copper, etched bronze, and cold iron, damp granite walls of a massive warehouse nave, Mood intent: These prototypes are Cid's children. Intimate mood captures the tender relationship between maker and creation.

        Generate a NEW scene matching the scenario.


        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

        1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

        2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

        3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

        4. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.


        SCENARIO: nave-like stone hall with 30ft+ ceilings, heavy timber trusses laced with pulsing violet conduits, expansive timber floor with multiple work islands, high clerestory windows casting narrow light shafts, Cidrella: rock-gnome, small in the vast space, archaeological layers of blueprints covering massive walls, floating magelight crystals providing localized pools of gold, no robots—large-scale mechanisms of bronze and wood, archeological walls: layers of vellum blueprints and architectural schematics pinned over every massive stone surface, arcane vines: thick, trunk-like bundles of copper wire and leather snaking along 30ft rafters like ivy, Unit 7: a massive multi-jointed arm of polished weirwood and etched bronze with glowing violet runic joints, the prosthetic: Cid's own arm as a masterpiece of arcane conduits and silver-solder alloy, harmonic dampeners: small spinning bronze disks that create a constant, soothing hum, charged quartz filters: crystalline structures integrated into high ventilation ducts, glowing with static fields, lightning-lime fizz station: condensation-beaded ceramic carafes and mismatched clay mugs, rock-gnome scale: furniture and stools sized for gnomes, making the massive hall feel even larger, safety ward-glyphs etched into bench edges and tool racks (practical magic), everbright magelight crystals hung to eliminate glare on delicate work, A cluttered perch of prototypes—the clockwork crab mid-assembly, lacking a leg, gears visible through open housing. The half-assembled clockwork bird on its stand, beak parted as if about to chirp. Dust patterns reveal which have been touched recently., light from high clerestory windows and floating crystals, dramatic light shafts in a voluminous space, volumetric ozone haze and metallic dust, dominant colors: stone grey (walls), arcane violet (conduits), warm timber amber; accent colors: copper-red (hair), citrus green (fizz), ink indigo, high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: living weirwood, dark polished mahogany, and singed oak, silver-solder alloy, rose copper, etched bronze, and cold iron, damp granite walls of a massive warehouse nave, Mood intent: These prototypes are Cid's children. Intimate mood captures the tender relationship between maker and creation.
