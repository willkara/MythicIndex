# Cidrella Vexweld’s Workshop – Overview

## Basic Information
- **Type**: Artificer workshop / arcane engineering lab
- **Region**: Waterdeep (Castle Ward, artisan row)
- **Coordinates/Position**: Upslope from the Dock Ward, among precision workshops and specialty houses
- **First Appearance**: Chapter 33 (An Architect’s Honor)
- **Significance Level**: Moderate (character-defining reveal and recruitment pivot)

## Quick Description
Cidrella Vexweld’s workshop is a contained explosion of creativity: blueprints tacked to every surface, wires running like vines along walls, and half-finished contraptions clicking and ticking as if the room itself refuses to sit still. Ozone and hot metal ride the air; arcane conduits hum in the bones of the building. In the center, a multi-jointed metal arm (Unit 7) performs domestic miracles with the delicacy of a surgeon and the enthusiasm of a child.

## Visual Summary
- Blueprint layers, chalk notes, and pinned sketches on walls, rafters, and cabinet faces
- Tool pegboards and hanging implements; hooks that rattle when power surges ride the room
- Arcane conduit runs and power junctions; occasional sparking under emotional load
- Benches crowded with tools, gears, and experimental housings; mismatched cups and improvised comforts
- Mechanical helper arm as a focal point: precise pouring of a local fizzy drink that can snap into an aggressive configuration

## Story Role
- **Plot Relevance**:
  - Introduces Cid’s personality and engineering genius through environment
  - The moment her work is revealed as a perverted weapon, catalyzing her commitment to the rescue mission
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Creation as identity—when the work is corrupted, the maker bleeds
- **Recurring Location**: Likely (a natural hub for fabrication, prototyping, and strategy)

## Key Features
- **Notable Landmarks**: Central work floor, heavy oak workbench (destroyed in Ch 33), pegboard tool wall, blueprint walls, conduit trunks, Unit 7 station
- **Unique Aspects**:
  - “Lived-in” engineering space where hospitality protocols and lethal precision occupy the same square foot
  - **Sympathetic Resonance**: When Cid’s emotions spike, the workshop responds—tools vibrating on pegboards, conduits flaring, Unit 7 snapping from hospitality into attack angles, and small prototypes reacting noisily
- **Hazards/Dangers**: Electrical arcs, hot metal, sharp parts, unstable prototypes, and sudden flying debris during power surges
- **Resources/Attractions**: Prototyping, arcane-mechanical fabrication, rapid iteration, bespoke systems design

## Connections
- **Connected Locations**:
  - *Korrath Threnx’s Office*: Nearby, contrasting space of disciplined structural design (`korraths-office`)
  - *Dock Ward Warehouse Complex*: Practical client and operational partner location (`dock-ward-warehouse-complex`)
- **Transportation Methods**: Foot travel through city streets; small carts for parts and prototypes
- **Distance from Other Key Locations**: Within city-walk distance of Castle Ward and Dock Ward routes

## Accessibility
- **Who Can Access**: Visitors welcomed in by Cid; collaborators and friends; clients when she’s taking commissions
- **Restrictions**: Practical safety over formality—hands-off prototypes, mind the conduits, and expect active hazard zones inside
- **Hidden Aspects**: Prototype storage; private notes embedded in blueprint margins (per the workshop epigraph)
- **Secret Paths/Entrances**: None known; clutter and layout provide accidental concealment

## Notes
*Treat `cids-workshop` as a character-space: the physical environment should reflect Cid’s energy, brilliance, and vulnerability when her work is weaponized.*
