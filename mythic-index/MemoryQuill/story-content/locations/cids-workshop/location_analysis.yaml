  narrative_soul: |
    This is not a workshop that Cid works in—it's Cid externalized. Every rattling tool, 
    half-finished miracle, and humming conduit is a thought she hasn't finished having, 
    an idea mid-combustion. The space breathes with her, celebrates with her, and when 
    her world cracks in Chapter 33, it becomes a weapon or a warning. This is where 
    creation-as-identity is literalized: the room doesn't just contain her work, it IS her work.
    
  one_line_essence: "A maker's soul given physical form—brilliant, chaotic, and dangerously alive"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "Creation as identity"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Hospitality and hostility coexisting (Unit 7's dual nature)"
      - "Controlled chaos versus genuine danger"
      - "The vulnerability of making—when work is perverted, the maker is violated"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "Order disguised as chaos vs. chaos pretending to be order"
      - "Welcoming home vs. active hazard zone"
      - "Domestic comfort vs. military potential"
      - "Individual genius vs. how that genius can be weaponized by others"

  transformation_arc: |
    The workshop begins as pure character expression—Cid's brilliant, scattered, 
    welcoming energy made physical. In Chapter 33, it becomes a crime scene of sorts: 
    the oak workbench is destroyed (by Cid's own augmented strength in anguish), the 
    space itself reacts violently to her emotional spike. After this, the workshop carries 
    a wound—a visible scar where the heavy workbench once stood. The space that was 
    "creation as identity" now also holds "violation of creation."

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Functional artisan storefront adapted into workshop/living space"
  primary_materials:
    - "Oiled wood (worn, scorched in places)"
    - "Metal (scorched, resin-coated housings)"
    - "Cable bundles (quick-tied, functional over elegant)"
    - "Slate or similar flooring (worn by constant pacing)"
  scale_impression: "Compact but vertically dense—every surface used, every wall layered"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Blueprint stratification on every vertical surface—walls become archives of ideas. 
    Unit 7's articulated arm in the domestic corner, poised between hospitality and threat. 
    The electrical veins of arcane conduits running like the shop's circulatory system.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Never silent. Rhythmic clicking from half-finished mechanisms. A steady electrical 
    hum underneath all conversation, rising when the shop is "awake." The occasional 
    chirp from the clockwork bird. When tension rises: tools vibrating on pegboards, 
    the hum becoming a threatening drone.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Ozone first—sharp and immediate. Then hot metal, machine oil, and something 
    unexpectedly domestic: the citrus-lime fizz that Cid keeps for guests. It's a 
    strange olfactory cocktail that says "danger" and "welcome" simultaneously.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Static in the air—hair-raising even when calm. Warm from task lighting and 
    equipment. Underfoot: metal filings, the occasional escaped screw, the texture 
    of worn wood and scattered debris. The sense that touching the wrong thing 
    might earn a spark or a pinch from something that wasn't meant to be touched.

  light_character: |
    Task lighting creates bright islands in a sea of warm shadow. The practical 
    illumination is focused, intentional—where work happens, there's light. 
    Everything else exists in a "blueprint pale" dimness punctuated by the 
    occasional arcane glow from conduits or active prototypes. When emotional 
    surges hit, the conduits flare brighter, creating a dangerous strobe effect.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Interior space—weather matters less than Cid's mood. However, the conduit 
    systems likely hum louder during storms (arcane resonance with atmospheric 
    electricity). Humidity might affect some mechanisms. The space feels 
    perpetually warm from equipment regardless of season.

contextual_place:
  region: "Castle Ward, Waterdeep"
  neighborhood_character: |
    Artisan row—precision workshops and specialty houses. This is where skilled 
    makers cluster, where guild standards and individual genius compete. Cid's 
    workshop is distinctive not because it's grander but because it's louder, 
    more alive, more obviously inhabited by its maker's personality. Nearby, 
    Korrath Threnx's office provides sharp contrast: disciplined structural design 
    versus Cid's beautiful chaos.
    
  approach_sequences:

      description: |
        Angling uphill through increasingly refined streets. The workshop 
        doesn't announce itself with grandeur—practical storefront scale among 
        peers. But as you approach, you might hear it: the hum, the clicking, 
        the occasional metallic chirp from within.
      first_impression: "Modest exterior hiding something very awake inside"
      
    - name: "From deeper Castle Ward"
      description: |
        Passing other artisan shops, each with their specialty signage and 
        ordered facades. Cid's reads as similar until you notice: movement 
        through the windows, shadows that shift without obvious cause, the 
        faint electrical smell even from outside.

  spatial_relationship: |
    The workshop sits in a transitional zone—uphill from the practical chaos of 
    the Dock Ward, not quite in the refined heights of the Castle Ward proper. 
    This in-between quality suits Cid: too wild for the guilds, too skilled for 
    the docks, making a space where both worlds can visit.

      tools and materials in organized chaos. This is where the real work happens, 
      where ideas become objects. The destruction of the central oak bench in
