# The Bastion of Last Light - Overview

## Basic Information
- **Official Name**: The Bastion of Last Light
- **Type**: Fortified, terraced compound built into a natural hillside.
- **Region**: Sword Coast North, on the outskirts of Waterdeep.
- **Position**: A few miles from the city walls, overlooking the Trade Way.
- **Significance Level**: Primary headquarters and sanctuary for the Last Light Company.

## Core Concept
The Bastion is a "benevolent fortress," designed to be a welcoming sanctuary that is inherently secure through its clever, organic architecture rather than intimidating fortifications. Built from warm, honey-colored stone, it appears to grow naturally from the terraced hillside it occupies. Its core philosophy is to be a place of hope and renewal, run by pragmatic professionals who understand the cost of failure.

## Architectural Layout
The Bastion is organized around a central, cascading open-air hub—the Great Courtyard—with four primary terraces of buildings wrapping around it.

- **The Great Courtyard**: The heart of the Bastion. A multi-level, open-air space featuring ancient oak trees, communal fire pits, and a central fountain. It serves as the primary social and circulatory hub, with paths and grand staircases connecting to all terraces. This is the main domain of **Grimjaw Ironbeard**, the Company's social anchor.

- **The Four Terraces**:
    1.  **The Sanctuary (Lowest Terrace)**: Opens onto the courtyard's garden level. Dedicated to healing and spiritual recovery.
    2.  **The Establishment (Main Terrace)**: Opens onto the courtyard's main social level. The public-facing and day-to-day operational hub.
    3.  **The Tower of Innovation (Middle Terrace)**: Accessed via a grand staircase from the courtyard. The intellectual and creative engine of the Company.
    4.  **The Keep (Upper Terrace)**: The highest, most secure level. The nerve center for command, strategy, and heavy engineering.

## Story Role
- **Plot Relevance**: Central hub for all Company operations, from mission planning to recovery and research.
- **Symbolic Meaning**: A physical embodiment of the Company's dual nature: a fortress built around a hearthstone; a place of hope defended by hardened realists.
- **Recurring Location**: Yes, the primary home base.

## Integrated Systems & Features
- **The Green Mantle (Terraced Gardens)**: A network of gardens that drapes over and between the stone terraces, providing food, medicinal herbs (for **Aldwin**), quiet retreats, and open-air training grounds.
- **The Undercroft (Underground Network)**: A secure network of tunnels and natural caves beneath the Bastion, connecting key strategic locations and housing a command bunker and secure vaults.
- **The Foundation (Natural Cave Integration)**: The Bastion incorporates the hillside's natural caves for specialized rooms (like **Nireya's** Liminal Chamber), storage, and forge ventilation (for **Korrath**).
- **The Open Path (Accessibility)**: A core design principle ensuring accessibility for all. The complex features wide ramps alongside all major stairs and a system of **Cidrella**-designed mechanical lifts for vertical transport.
