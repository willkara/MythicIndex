# The Bastion of Last Light - Physical Description

## Architectural Philosophy & Sensory Details
The Bastion of Last Light is a marvel of organic architecture, conceived as a living sanctuary that grows from the very hillside it occupies. It avoids the harsh, imposing lines of a traditional fortress, instead favoring sweeping curves, rounded towers, and the warm, inviting glow of honey-colored stone. The entire complex is designed to feel like a natural extension of the landscape—a beacon of hope that is welcoming, yet inherently secure through its clever design.

The air hums with a blend of purposeful activity and serene calm. The scent of damp earth from the gardens mingles with the smell of woodsmoke from the courtyard fires and the faint, sharp tang of ozone from the Tower of Innovation. The soundscape is a constant symphony of life: the murmur of conversation, the clang of a distant forge, the rustle of leaves, and the reassuring silence of the ancient stones.

## The Great Courtyard: The Heart of the Bastion
The true heart of the complex is the Great Courtyard, a vibrant, multi-level space carved from the hillside that serves as the Bastion's social and circulatory hub.
- **The Lower Level**: Accessible from the Sanctuary terrace, this area is a tranquil space of reflection. Medicinal herb gardens and quiet fountains create a serene atmosphere.
- **The Main Level**: A grand staircase leads to the bustling main level, shaded by the boughs of ancient oak trees. Here, flagged stone patios host communal fire pits where **Grimjaw Ironbeard** holds court, telling stories and acting as the social anchor for the entire company. The central fountain, carved with the Company's beacon symbol, provides a constant, soothing sound of running water. All paths, ramps, and stairways branch off from this central hub.

## The Four Terraces: A Sectional Breakdown

### 1. The Sanctuary (Lowest Terrace)
The most accessible and peaceful level, dedicated to healing the body, mind, and spirit.
- **The Temple of Renewal**: A large, open-arched hall that feels both like a top-tier medical facility and a holy place. The air smells of antiseptic herbs and calming incense. It is run with quiet efficiency by **Brother Aldwin**.
- **The Hall of Remembrance**: A solemn, quiet hall lined with stone plinths. Some bear the names of the saved, others the names of the fallen, and some feature detailed carvings of the monsters or symbols of the organizations responsible—a grim but vital threat assessment gallery.
- **The Liminal Chamber**: A natural, sound-dampening cave, warded and shielded. This is **Nireya's** domain for her intense, often dangerous, spiritual communications.

### 2. The Establishment (Main Terrace)
The primary public interface and day-to-day operational hub, bustling with activity.
- **The Common Hall**: A large, welcoming hall with a massive hearth, used for meals and community gatherings. Its reinforced structure allows it to double as a civilian shelter.
- **The Armoury & Ready Room**: A highly organized facility for storing and maintaining all field gear, with an attached room for final mission briefings and discreet deployment via the Undercroft.
- **Vera's Intelligence Center**: The nerve center for active field operations, filled with maps, witness sketches, and the constant comings and goings of scouts and messengers.

### 3. The Tower of Innovation (Middle Terrace)
The intellectual and creative engine of the Bastion, a hive of "organized chaos" and focused research.
- **Cidrella's Prototyping Workshop**: A semi-detached workshop filled with the sparks of invention, the clutter of genius, and the constant hum of arcane machinery.
- **Marcus's Intelligence Vault**: A secure, climate-controlled archive where the Company's collected knowledge—from historical texts to enemy profiles—is meticulously catalogued and guarded.
- **Rylan's Aerie**: At the top of the tower, this circular observatory has a retractable roof and is filled with complex arcane instruments—an Orrery of the Skies, elemental chimes, and scrying pools—that allow him to monitor and influence the weather.

### 4. The Keep (Upper Terrace)
The highest and most secure level, the nerve center for high-level strategy and heavy engineering.
- **Korrath's Siege-Works**: A heavy-duty workshop and forge, partially built into a natural cave for ventilation. This is where the tools of rescue—and war—are built and tested.
- **The Command Building**:
    - **Thorne's Strategic Operations Center**: The bustling main floor, dominated by a massive strategy table and filled with the energy of active command.
    - **Veyra's Command Dais & Stratum**: At the head of the Ops Center is a raised dais where **Commander Veyra** maintains her open-plan command post. From here, a spiral staircase leads to the Stratum, a private, enclosed loft for the most critical decisions and solitary contemplation.
