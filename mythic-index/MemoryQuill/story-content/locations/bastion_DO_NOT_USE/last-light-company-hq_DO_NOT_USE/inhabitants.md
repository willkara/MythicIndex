## Other Notable Inhabitants

### Support Staff
The Bastion employs a permanent staff of skilled individuals who handle the day-to-day operations, including medics under Aldwin, engineers under Korrath, quartermasters, cooks, and stable hands. They are considered part of the extended Last Light family.

### Temporary Residents
The recovery wings of the Temple of Renewal are often home to those rescued by the Company, providing a safe, long-term sanctuary for physical and psychological healing before they transition back to their lives.

## Culture & Living Arrangements
While the Bastion has designated barracks for support staff, the core members have private quarters integrated into the terrace buildings that best suit their roles. For example, Aldwin has a quiet room near the Temple of Renewal, while Korrath's is adjacent to the Siege-Works. This co-location of living and working space reinforces the all-consuming nature of their duties. Despite the professional focus, a strong sense of found family pervades the entire complex, centered on the communal meals in the Common Hall and the fireside stories in the Great Courtyard.
