## Quick Description
A civic-scale library complex organized around a grand reading hall with clerestory lanterns, disciplined column grids, and a secured vault core. Public entry flows through a dual vestibule screening system into layered quiet zones, while sub-archives below grade maintain cool, stable microclimates with flood-stop protections and isolation valves added after a prior water incident.
