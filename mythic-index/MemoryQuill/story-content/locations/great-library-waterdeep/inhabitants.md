## Basic Demographics
- Roles Present (by function, not society): 
  - Public Readers/Visitors (variable headcount, peaks midday)
  - Registered Researchers (badge access; scheduled desk reservations)
  - Archivists & Curators (collection care, accessioning, vault supervision)
  - Conservators/Scriptoriums Staff (repair, stabilization, copying)
  - Reference & Floor Staff (wayfinding, desk coverage, circulation control)
  - Security & Access Control (entry screening, chokepoint supervision, patrols)
  - Porters & Facilities (intake, internal logistics, cleaning, maintenance)
  - Engineering/Systems (environmental controls, drainage/roof lantern service)
- Typical Occupancy Bands:
  - Reading Hall: 60–260 (low → peak)
  - Stacks: 20–80 distributed
  - Research Rooms/Scriptorium: 8–24 technicians/scholars
  - Sub-Archives: 3–12 staff-only
  - Security/Facilities/Engineering combined: 8–20 on shift

## Space Usage (Who uses which areas)
- Entry & Vestibule (Public + Security):
  - Public enters; bag checks and queue management under Security supervision.
  - Staff priority door for shift changes and deliveries (controlled).
- Grand Reading Hall (Public/Researchers/Reference Staff):
  - Public reading, researcher carrels; reference counters at perimeter.
  - Staff maintain light, noise, and seating order (soft enforcement).
- General Stacks (Public/Researchers/Staff):
  - Public open access aisles; rolling ladders under staff guidelines.
  - Shelf resets, endcap updates, and safety checks by Stacks team.
- Research Rooms (Researchers/Archivists):
  - Reserved desks, supervised materials handling; pass windows to Quarantine.
  - Short consults with Curators for special requests.
- Scriptorium & Conservation Labs (Conservators/Technicians only):
  - Negative-pressure benches, gloveboxes; no public access.
  - Appointment-based handoffs with Curators.
- Restricted Stacks Vault (Curators/Senior Archivists/Security):
  - Two-tier access (outer restricted, inner vault); escorted researcher viewings by exception.
  - Shifted staffing during audits and inventory cycles.
- Sub-Archives (Archivists/Porters/Engineering as needed):
  - Materials retrieval, compact shelving operations; environmental walk-throughs.
  - Flood-stop checks and sump inspection on designated schedule.
- Service/Receiving/Quarantine (Porters/Conservators/Archivists):
  - Intake, inspection, and quarantine; routing to labs or cataloging.
  - Waste egress separate to avoid cross-traffic.
- Roof Lanterns & Maintenance Walks (Engineering/Facilities only):
  - Lantern sealing, baffle adjustment, lightning protection checks.
  - Weather station calibration; tie-off protocols enforced.

## Minimal Role Notes (physical interactions only)
- Archivists/Curators: key holders for restricted thresholds; operate airlock sequences.
- Security: positions at chokepoints; handles alarm pulls and controlled evacuations.
- Conservators: operate fume hoods and neutralization sinks; PPE storage managed locally.
- Porters: operate lift platforms; manage cart flows to avoid public paths during peaks.
- Engineering: monitors RH/temperature bands; executes isolation valves and flood-stop deployments during storm protocol.

## Access Tiers (physical)
- Tier A: Public Zones (Entry, Reading Hall, designated Stacks aisles)
- Tier B: Research Zones (Research Rooms, supervised materials desks)
- Tier C: Staff Zones (Scriptorium, Labs, Quarantine, Sub-Archives corridors)
- Tier D: Restricted Core (Vault shell and inner vault; dual-authorized entry)

## Shift Patterns (indicative)
- Morning Prep (pre-open): Engineering checks (lanterns/filters), Security post-up, Cleaning finish, Reference set desks.
- Midday Peak: Full Reference coverage; extra Security at Entry; Porters pause large moves.
- Evening Taper: Materials reshelving; vault audits; environmental re-baseline.
- Night Mode: Security patrol; janitorial pathing; low-speed air handlers; Engineering maintenance window.

## Notes
- Crowd control relies on line-of-sight from staff posts to Entry, Reading Hall, and primary Stacks aisles.
- Rolling ladder use requires clear aisle widths; staff intervene on congestion.
- During storm alerts, Engineering triggers flood stops at sub-archive thresholds; Porters reroute carts to upper levels until “all clear.”
