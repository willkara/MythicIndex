Let me analyze this location thoroughly using the Location Story Analyst framework.

## Understanding the Location

The Great Library of Waterdeep is a major civic institution - a large-scale library complex with:
- A grand reading hall with clerestory lighting
- Multiple access zones (public, research, restricted)
- Sub-archives below ground
- Conservation/restoration facilities
- Strong security infrastructure

## Key Canon Details from the Files

From the description, the most important [FIRM] canon anchors are:
1. Sub-archives exist and were involved in a collapse entrapment event
2. City Watch cordon and public perimeter control occurred at the site
3. Burst fountain pipe/water inflow affected lower areas during rescue
4. Magical/electrical fixtures arced under wet conditions
5. Unstable "breathing" wall section identified by engineers
6. Precision keystone manipulation used to settle debris and open passage

This tells me this location was the site of a significant rescue/collapse event in the story - likely involving the Last Light Company given their rescue capabilities.

## Narrative Soul Analysis

This location represents:
- Order vs. chaos (the controlled, systematic library vs. the chaos of a collapse)
- Preservation of knowledge (what the library protects)
- A place where danger lurks beneath the surface (the sub-archives, the flooding risk)
- The contrast between the serene public face and the crisis below

The library is NOT primarily "home" like the warehouse compound - it's a CRISIS SITE. It's where something went wrong, where people were trapped, where rescue happened.

## Zones Analysis

Key zones:
1. **Entry & Vestibule** - Threshold (public/private boundary)
2. **Grand Reading Hall** - Heart (the symbolic center of knowledge)
3. **General Stacks** - Commons (public access)
4. **Research Rooms & Scriptorium** - Forge (where restoration/creation happens)
5. **Restricted Vault** - Sanctuary (protection of the most precious)


6. **Sub-Archives** - The critical crisis zone where structural failure and rescue operations unfolded
7. **Service/Quarantine** - Secondary threshold managing access and potential contamination
8. **Roof/Maintenance** - Perimeter defining external access points

## Temporal States

The location transitions between two dramatic states:
1. Peaceful, meticulously organized daily operations
2. Chaotic emergency with structural collapse and urgent rescue efforts

## Visual Opportunities

Compelling visual narrative moments emerge from:
1. Dramatic sub-archive collapse scene with water intrusion
2. Intense rescue operation amid architectural destruction
3. Contrast between pristine library spaces and devastated underground areas

## Character-Space Relationships

Potential key actors in this unfolding scenario include specialized response teams:
- Emergency rescue personnel
- City Watch maintaining external control
- Technical engineering experts
- Trapped institutional personnel experiencing immediate survival challenges
