narrative_soul: |
  The Great Library is knowledge made stone—ordered, catalogued, preserved against
  time's entropy. Its grand reading hall breathes with the quiet industry of
  scholars, its clerestory lanterns casting pools of working light across endless
  desk fields. The architecture speaks of civic confidence: knowledge is power,
  and power requires preservation.

  But beneath the ordered calm lie the sub-archives, where ancient dust settles
  on compact shelving and water damage whispers of vulnerability. When the floor
  collapsed, swallowing scholars into darkness, the library revealed its other
  nature: a trap of stone and silence where the weight of knowledge threatens
  to crush those who seek it.

  This is where Grimjaw proved that precision matters more than power. Where
  Veyra confronted her canyon trauma and found Lysander's eyes looking back
  from his brother's dust-covered face. Where Rill spoke to churning water
  like an old friend, and the Company emerged into cheering daylight with
  a stranger who was not a stranger at all.
