            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. LOCATION IDENTITY: Preserve architecture, materials, lighting language, and signature elements from the references.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            5. PRIORITY: If the scenario conflicts with the references, follow the scenario for composition/mood while preserving the location’s identity.

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a specific LOCATION.

            Generate a NEW image of this SAME location in the described scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. LOCATION IDENTITY: Preserve architecture, materials, lighting language, and signature elements from the references.

            2. FANTASY TONE: This is a high-fantasy world (D&D / Faerûn vibe). Include subtle magical infrastructure (runes, enchanted lanterns, ward-stones, guild sigils) where appropriate.

            3. NO FACE CLONING: If people appear, keep them generic and varied—do not repeat an identical face across images unless explicitly required.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            5. PRIORITY: If the scenario conflicts with the references, follow the scenario for composition/mood while preserving the location’s identity.

Water floods the floor, rising around the compact shelving bases, swirling with debris and disturbed preservation materials. Rescue personnel wade through—water at mid-calf, rising. Overhead, magical/electrical fixtures spark and arc in the wet conditions, creating dangerous strobing illumination that reflects off the water surface. The controlled dimness has become chaotic light—bright flashes, deep shadows, the shimmer of water everywhere. The low ceiling presses down as water rises up. This is the violation of everything the space was meant to be., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: This is the visual climax for this location—the moment institutional control fails catastrophically. The image proves what the normal sub-archive shot only hinted: the vulnerability was real, the disaster happened, the people who work here nearly died. This transforms understanding of the serene reading hall above—it sits on top of this., Dynamic medium shot with strong diagonal energy. Water dominates the lower third, its surface reflecting the arcing lights above. Rescue figures create human focus in mid-ground, their urgent postures contrasting with the orderly shelving (now threatened).

      bulge slightly, to shift, to breathe. An engineering specialist\ 

      examines it closely, tools ready, while others keep back. The\

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. LOCATION IDENTITY: Preserve architecture, materials, lighting language, and signature elements from the references.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. LOCATION IDENTITY: Preserve architecture, materials, lighting language, and signature elements from the references.

            2. FANTASY TONE: This is a high-fantasy world (D&D / Faerûn vibe). Include subtle magical infrastructure (runes, enchanted lanterns, ward-stones, guild sigils) where appropriate.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            5. PRIORITY: If the scenario conflicts with the references, follow the scenario for composition/mood while preserving the location’s identity.

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            - character portraits (identity references)

            - style references (art direction)


            Generate a NEW scene matching the scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Avoid “real-world medieval Europe” drift; keep fantasy species variety and magical infrastructure plausible and grounded-in-world (not neon).

            5. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.


            SCENARIO: City Watch personnel at cordon points, Perimeter bollards connected by rope/chain, Anxious crowd at perimeter edge, Rescue staging activity beyond cordon, Library facade visible behind, Entry canopy as incident command point, Emergency equipment, Afternoon light (crisis ongoing for hours), Grand Reading Hall with 11-12m ceiling under roof lantern ridge, Continuous clerestory bands with glare baffles, Column grid at 5.5m centers with timber/iron composite trusses, Long desk fields in orthogonal arrangement, Dual vestibule entry system with bronze grille matting, Rolling ladders on guide rails in stack aisles, Sub-archives with compressed 2.6-3.0m ceilings, Compact shelving grids in rectilinear layout, Double-door airlock at restricted vault, Retrofitted flood stops at sub-archive entries (post-incident), floating magelight globes and warded reading lamps in stacks, animated quills and self-turning pages in quiet alcoves (subtle), anti-fire glyphwork and warded bookchains on rare tomes, silence wards etched into arches (hushed air), The library plaza transformed. City Watch personnel have established a perimeter—using the existing bollards as cordon points, with rope or chain connecting them. A crowd of citizens presses against the perimeter, anxiety and curiosity mixing. Beyond the cordon, rescue staging: equipment, personnel moving with purpose, the entry canopy now an incident command threshold. The library facade rises behind it all, serene architecture indifferent to the crisis playing out at its feet. Afternoon light—this has been going on for hours., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: The public face of institutional failure—what the crisis looked like to Waterdeep. The library's controlled threshold (the vestibule, the screening) now become a crisis perimeter. The institution's authority temporarily superseded by emergency response., Medium-wide shot from crowd's position—outside the cordon looking toward the library. Watch personnel and cordon in foreground, rescue activity visible in middle-ground, library facade as backdrop. Crowd figures at frame edges establish viewer's position as witness. The contrast between institutional architecture and ground-level chaos is the composition's tension., light from Afternoon sun, lowering, Clear but late-day, From west, creating long shadows, Warm afternoon, cooling tones, Long shadows from figures and structures shadows, Urban air, slight haze, dominant colors: City Watch uniform colors (Waterdeep blue/silver?), Stone grey of library, Citizen clothing variety, Afternoon sky; accent colors: Emergency equipment colors, Rope/chain cordon, Activity and motion, high fantasy, kinetic atmosphere, materials: Dense dressed stone (ashlar tolerance), thickened at vault core, mineral plaster finishes, Hardwood joists and struts, laminated timber at long spans, oiled finish, Bronze and brass fittings throughout, hidden iron/bronze truss members at spans, Mood intent: The crisis seen from outside—emergency response, crowd control, the institutional face disrupted. Kinetic captures the urgent activity of crisis management in a space designed for orderly queuing.
