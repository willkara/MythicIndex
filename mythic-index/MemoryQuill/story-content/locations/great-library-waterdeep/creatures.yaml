creatures:
  - name: Page Turner
    description: Tiny fey creatures that live between the pages of old books. They're obsessive organizers, reshelf wandering books at night, and punish those who damage texts. Librarians who earn their trust find lost references mysteriously appearing on their desks.
    visual_aspects:
      - Flat, paper-thin bodies that slip between book pages
      - Appear as animated bookmarks or pressed flowers when moving
      - Faces visible only when they turn sideways, showing profiles
      - Fingers like delicate ribbons that leave no fingerprints
      - Rustle like turning pages when they move in groups
    habitat:
      where: Between pages of old books, behind shelves, in card catalog drawers
      when: Active during closing hours when library is quiet
      why: Feed on book mites and silverfish; maintain natural book organization
    behavior:
      who: Colonies organized by subject matter—history Turners don't mix with philosophy
      what: Reorganize misplaced books, repair minor damage, hunt parasites
      how: Can phase through solid books; leave books they've touched slightly warm
    lore: Senior librarians know to leave difficult research questions on note cards overnight. If Page Turners approve, you'll find relevant books pulled and stacked by morning. But woe to anyone who dog-ears pages or breaks spines—they'll find every book they need mysteriously misshelved for months.

  - name: Ink Phantom
    description: Spectral entities that form from the collective thoughts and emotions poured into written words. They manifest as shadows of text and illustrations that peel off pages and drift through the air, sometimes coalescing into coherent shapes that act out stories.
    visual_aspects:
      - Appear as flowing script and diagrams detached from their pages
      - Form temporary shapes: knights from histories, dragons from bestiaries
      - Visible only in dim light or peripheral vision
      - Multiple colors corresponding to different ink types
      - Move with flowing, calligraphic grace
    habitat:
      where: Reading rooms, especially near collections of dramatic literature and histories
      when: Most visible during quiet study hours when readers are absorbed
      why: Manifestations of the emotional energy readers invest in texts
    behavior:
      who: Individual manifestations or collective echoes of powerful written works
      what: Sometimes reenact scenes from their source texts
      how: Harmless but distracting; can make studying difficult when active
    lore: Scholars debate whether Ink Phantoms are truly sentient or just magical echoes. What's certain is that libraries with active Phantom populations report better book preservation—as if the stories themselves protect their physical forms.

  - name: Dust Mote Swarm
    description: Colonies of microscopic magical organisms that feed on paper, leather, and parchment. Individually invisible, but colonies form clouds of glittering dust that can strip books to skeletons in hours. The library's environmental controls were partially designed to combat them.
    visual_aspects:
      - Individually invisible; colonies appear as shimmering dust clouds
      - Glitter with rainbow iridescence when caught in light beams
      - Active swarms create visible haze around targeted books
      - Leave behind geometric patterns on damaged pages
      - Make faint crackling sound like static electricity
    habitat:
      where: Anywhere books are stored, especially in poorly ventilated areas
      when: Population booms during humid seasons; suppressed by desiccants
      why: Feed on cellulose, leather, and organic binding materials
    behavior:
      who: Colonies numbering in billions; operate as collective organisms
      what: Systematically consume organic library materials
      how: Reproduce exponentially in favorable conditions; devastating when uncontrolled
    lore: The great Dust Mote outbreak of 1342 DR destroyed a third of the library's collection. Modern environmental controls keep populations minimal, but librarians still check for telltale glitter and carry emergency desiccant canisters.

  - name: Whisper Keeper
    description: Silent, robed figures that appear in the deepest archives and restricted sections. They never speak but communicate through gestures and by arranging books into messages. Some believe they're the ghosts of ancient librarians; others claim they're the library's will made manifest.
    visual_aspects:
      - Tall humanoid shapes in archaic librarian robes
      - Faces obscured by deep hoods showing only darkness
      - Movements completely silent; seem to glide rather than walk
      - Hands visible as aged, ink-stained but translucent
      - Presence causes nearby candles to burn with steady, unflickering light
    habitat:
      where: Restricted archives, vault cores, and sub-basement storage
      when: Appear unpredictably; more common during research of forbidden topics
      why: Guard dangerous knowledge and guide worthy scholars
    behavior:
      who: Unknown number; possibly the same entity appearing repeatedly
      what: Block access to dangerous texts; arrange clues for approved researchers
      how: Can pass through doors and shelves; presence causes magical silence
    lore: Those who respect the Keeper's warnings report finding exactly the safe alternative sources they need. Those who persist in seeking forbidden knowledge experience escalating "accidents"—shelves collapse, lights fail, doors lock mysteriously. The Keepers have never harmed anyone directly, but three researchers have disappeared in the deep archives over the centuries.
