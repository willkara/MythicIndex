# The Great Library of Waterdeep – Physical Description

[Canon Strength Key: [FIRM] established in chapters | [IMPLIED] inferred from context | [FLEXIBLE] writer’s connective tissue]

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Urban civic parcel within central Waterdeep fabric; bounded by paved streets on at least two sides; primary frontage opens to a controlled public plaza with perimeter bollards and wayfinding posts. Grade falls slightly to the east (1.5–2.0% slope) aiding surface runoff. [FLEXIBLE]
- Site Advantages: Hard perimeter and regular street grid allow clear crowd control on events and emergencies; plaza staging supports equipment access without blocking thoroughfares. [FLEXIBLE]
- Environmental Factors: Coastal humidity and salt-laden air plus urban dust require filtration and corrosion‑aware hardware; seasonal rainfall drives roof and surface drainage capacity; wind channels along street canyons create localized gusts at entries. [FLEXIBLE]
- Approach Routes: 
  - Public approach via plaza and vestibule screening. 
  - Staff/service approach via side lane and recessed delivery bay with roll-through trolleys.
  - Emergency ingress/egress via sally corridors connecting to side streets. [FLEXIBLE]

## Architectural Overview (present-state; no historical styling)
- Construction Style (functional typologies, not era-based): 
  - Composite load framework: column-and-beam grids in reading halls; thickened perimeter walls at stacks; diaphragm floors tying grids; localized vaulting over restricted zones (for lateral stability). [FLEXIBLE]
- Primary Materials: Dense dressed stone for external walls and foundations; hardwood joists/struts; laminated timber or hidden iron/bronze truss members at long-span roof lanterns; bronze/brass fittings; mineral plasters; clay/stone tile roofing; safety glazing in skylights. [FLEXIBLE]
- Construction Methods: Tight-fitted masonry (ashlar-like tolerance); mortise-tenon joinery at timber frames; through-pins at high-tension joints; compression-locked stair cores; redundant anchor points for catwalks. [FLEXIBLE]
- Overall Layout (organizational logic): Public frontage → Entry Screening & Vestibule → Grand Reading Hall (central) → General Stacks (radial aisles) → Research Rooms & Scriptorium (quiet belt) → Restricted Stacks Vault (secured core); vertical circulation via main stair cores + lift platforms (counterweight/manual capstan) to Sub-Archives below grade. [FLEXIBLE]

## Canon Anchors (from chapters)
- Sub-archives exist and were involved in a collapse entrapment event. [FIRM]
- City Watch cordon and public perimeter control occurred at the site. [FIRM]
- Burst fountain pipe/water inflow affected lower areas during rescue; magical/electrical fixtures arced under wet conditions. [FIRM]
- Unstable “breathing” wall section identified by engineers; precision keystone manipulation used to settle debris and open passage (engineering approach typical in collapse). [FIRM/IMPLIED]
