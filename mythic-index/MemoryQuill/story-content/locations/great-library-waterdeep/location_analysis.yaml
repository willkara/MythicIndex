  narrative_soul: |
    The Great Library is knowledge given architectural form—ordered, preserved, protected. 
    But beneath its serene reading halls lies a darker truth: the sub-archives where 
    something catastrophic happened, where water flooded through burst pipes, where 
    walls "breathed" with instability, and where precision engineering became the 
    difference between burial and rescue. This is a place that presents perfect 
    control while hiding the fragility beneath.

  transformation_arc: |
    The Library exists in two states: its normal serene function, and the crisis 
    state during/after the collapse. The story likely transforms the reader's 
    understanding of this place—what seems like pure order revealed as hiding 
    vulnerability. The retrofitted flood stops and isolation valves are scars 
    of the incident, permanent reminders that disaster struck here.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Civic institutional; composite load framework with column grids, thickened perimeter walls, and localized vaulting"
  primary_materials:
    - "Dense dressed stone (ashlar tolerance)"
    - "Hardwood joists and struts"
    - "Laminated timber and hidden iron/bronze truss members"
    - "Bronze and brass fittings"
    - "Mineral plasters"

    - "Safety glazing in skylights"
  scale_impression: "Grand civic scale above; claustrophobic compressed below; the contrast is the point"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Above: Long sightlines under roof lanterns, ordered desk fields in orthogonal 
    rhythms, the play of clerestory light on smooth stone and oiled wood. 
    Below: Low ceilings (2.6-3.0m), compact shelving grids, task lights pooling 
    in narrow aisles, the cool stable air of controlled preservation—until 
    the pipes burst.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Reading Hall: Cathedral-like hush, page turns, soft footfalls, distant ladder 
    rollers on guide rails. Sub-Archives: The low hum of air handlers, the 
    mechanical click of compact shelving, the echo of steps in corridor silence. 
    During crisis: Water rushing, stone groaning, the crack of arcing fixtures.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Clean paper, oiled wood, the mineral smell of stone. In conservation labs: 
    faint controlled solvent. In sub-archives: the cool earthy smell of 
    climate-controlled storage. During crisis: wet stone, metallic ozone 
    from arcing fixtures, the acrid smell of danger.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Smooth polished stone underfoot, the slight give of laminated flooring in 
    stacks, cool brass fixtures, the dry paper-soft air of the reading hall. 
    Sub-archives: notably cooler (17-19°C), the slight humidity-controlled 
    dryness, the compressed feeling of low ceilings.

  light_character: |
    The library is designed around controlled daylight—clerestory bands and roof 
    lanterns drive natural light into the reading hall, diffused by glare baffles 
    and light shelves. The result is luminous but never harsh, with bright task 
    zones at desk fields and calm dim perimeters. Below grade: no natural light, 
    only low-intensity task lighting preserving the cool controlled environment. 
    The contrast between above and below is stark.
    
  weather_influence: |
    External weather penetrates through vestibule pressure, roof drainage capacity, 
    and the constant threat of water to the archives below. Storm protocols exist 
    specifically because of flooding risk. The burst pipe incident proves weather/
    water systems can fail catastrophically. Coastal humidity and salt air require 
    filtration; wind channels at entries create localized gusts controlled by 
    the vestibule system.
