Let me analyze this location systematically using the framework provided.

## Location Identity

The Westwall Watchpost is a military outpost that serves as the Last Light Company's headquarters throughout much of the story. It's a twin-towered fortification that has been converted from a standard garrison facility into a lived-in operations base.

### Narrative Soul
This is fundamentally a place about transformation - both physical (from barracks to operations base) and thematic (from military institution to found-family home). The rigid military shell has been repurposed to serve a rescue/lifesaving mission rather than pure defense.

### Physical Truth
From the description, key elements include:
- Twin towers (52 ft main, 44 ft secondary) with overlapping sightlines
- Central hardstand courtyard (assembly, training, triage)
- East range - converted mess hall with large hearth
- West range - stables and forge/workshop
- Northwest infirmary
- Southwest storehouse
- Crenellated parapet walls
- Granite/limestone ashlar construction with oak/fir timber
- Slate roofing

### Zones
1. **Main Watchtower** - Heart/Command center, Vera's quarters at top
2. **Secondary Tower** - Perimeter/observation
3. **Mess Hall** - Commons/social heart with the hearth
4. **Workshop/Forge** - Forge zone (Grimjaw's domain)
5. **Infirmary** - Sanctuary
6. **Storehouse** - Support/logistics
7. **Courtyard** - Commons/training/triage
8. **Parapets** - Perimeter/liminal

### Character Associations
- Vera (Veyra?) - Main tower aerie quarters (Level 4), command
- Grimjaw - Workshop/forge
- Echo (animal) - Tower aerie perch

### Temporal States
The documentation provides excellent detail on daily cycles and seasonal variations.

### Story Timeline States


I track two critical phases of the Westwall Watchpost's existence. Initially, it functions as an active operational headquarters for the Last Light Company, serving as a dynamic base of military and rescue operations. Later, the location transforms dramatically, becoming a condemned structure after experiencing significant battle damage, with its structural integrity severely compromised.
