# NARRATIVE SOUL - Thematic Essence for AI Generation

narrative_soul: |
  The Westwall Watchpost is where a rigid military shell was transformed into a
  resilient, compassionate home. This twin-towered fortress on the western rise
  began as forgotten garrison infrastructure—"great construction waiting for
  someone to remember why it was built"—and became the Last Light Company's
  heart. Every cramped corner proves what they built: shoulder-to-shoulder
  breakfasts, triple-tier bunks, herbs in repurposed helmets. The great hearth
  in the mess hall anchors evening gatherings where names are given and missions
  born. Grimjaw's forge rings the morning bell. Vera's aerie watches over all.
  But this home was tested nearly to destruction: walls breached, dire wolf
  unleashed, family forming shield wall around their fallen. When the cavalry
  horns sounded salvation and the community arrived with wagons, the Westwall
  became more than headquarters—it became the proof that broken people can
  build something precious enough to defend with their lives.

one_line_essence: "A forgotten garrison transformed into found-family home, tested nearly to destruction, rebuilt by the community it protected."
