  narrative_soul: |
    The Westwall Watchpost is where the Last Light Company became more than soldiers—it's where they became a family. This rigid military shell, built for garrison duty and wall defense, has been transformed into something warmer: a rescue operations base where the mess hall hearth matters as much as the crenellated parapets. The building's disciplined bones—twin towers, hardstand courtyard, defensive chokepoints—enabled their tactical success, but its converted interiors—the enlarged hearth, the herb-lined infirmary, the organized forge—enabled their humanity. In the end, the very features that kept them alive are tested to destruction.
    
  one_line_essence: "Military bones, family heart—home until the walls fell"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "Transformation of institutional rigidity into compassionate resilience"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Twin towers as vigilance and protection"
      - "The hearth as social anchor and found-family condenser"
      - "Converted spaces as adaptation over inheritance"
      - "Stone that endures until it doesn't"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "military discipline vs. domestic warmth"
      - "defensive fortress vs. healing sanctuary"
      - "permanence of stone vs. vulnerability of inhabitants"
      - "institutional inheritance vs. intentional transformation"

  transformation_arc: |
    The Watchpost begins as an inherited garrison facility—competent, functional, impersonal. Through the Company's tenure, it transforms into a lived-in home: the barracks becomes a mess hall with a social hearth, storage rooms become an infirmary with herb racks, the forge becomes an engineering bay. The characters imprint themselves on the space. This makes the post-battle destruction emotionally devastating—not just infrastructure lost, but home destroyed. The condemned building represents the end of this chapter of the Company's life together.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Waterdeep civic-military utilitarianism—functional massing, low ornament, robust joinery; civic pride expressed through sound construction rather than decoration"
  primary_materials:
    - "granite and limestone ashlar with rubble cores"
    - "oak and fir timber for trusses, floors, stairs"
    - "wrought-iron straps, hinges, fasteners"
    - "slate roof tiles with clay ridge caps"
    - "lime mortar with pozzolanic additives"
    - "limewash weather coat on exposed masonry"
  scale_impression: "Compact but commanding—the twin towers dominate the low-rise surroundings, visible from the approaches, but the compound itself feels dense and purposeful rather than sprawling"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Twin stone towers flanking a rectangular courtyard, crenellated parapets creating a toothy silhouette against the sky. The constant plumes—smoke from the mess hall hearth and the forge stack—mark it as inhabited from a distance. Close approach reveals the lived-in details: herb racks along sunny walls, gear lines in the courtyard, the organized chaos of a facility optimized for rapid response rather than parade-ground appearance.
  sound_signature: |
    A working military facility: the rhythmic ring of Grimjaw's forge hammer, horse nickers and tack creak from the stables, the whine of wind through arrow slits, the messenger bell from the tower. Voices carry clearly across the hard courtyard surfaces. Evening brings the communal murmur of the mess hall, laughter and conversation bleeding warmth into the cold stone corridors.
  scent_signature: |
    Old leather and whetstone dust in the barracks-turned-quarters. Woodsmoke and slightly burnt bread drifting from the mess hall. Charcoal, hot metal, and oil near the forge. Clean hay and animal warmth from the stables. Herbs—drying and fresh—along the warm walls and concentrated in the infirmary.
  tactile_signature: |
    Cold stone worn smooth by generations of boots. Rough oak beams still bearing tool marks. The pervasive chill that pools in shadow and seeps from walls, making the warmth near hearths and braziers feel precious. Ice on the parapet walk in winter, the grit of sand scattered for traction.

  light_character: |
    Daylight enters through arrow slits, cutting knife-edged beams across interior stone. The mess hall's expanded windows provide warmer afternoon light. Tower levels grow progressively brighter toward the top, with the aerie quarters receiving the best natural light through its large leeward window. Night transforms the compound into a study in contrasts—hearth glow spilling amber across flagstones, lantern halos along the parapet walk, the cold blue darkness pooling in unlit corners.
  weather_influence: |
    Prevailing sea winds drive rain against the western walls, leaving vertical weep-streaks on the masonry. Snow scours from windward roof slopes and eddies in courtyard corners. The courtyard's crowned surface and marginal drains handle runoff, but storms test the system. The towers catch the worst of the wind—their slits whistle and moan. Winter makes the warm cores (mess hall hearth, infirmary braziers, forge) into precious refuges.

      The social anchor of the compound. A long room (~100 ft x 28 ft) dominated by the enlarged hearth at the south end—retrofitted with an expanded hood and flue liner to handle its new role as the building's heart. Communal tables fill the space, seating 36-44. A central timber colonnade supports the roof trusses. The scullery and pantry occupy the rear. Flagstone floors worn by decades of boots. The acoustic warmth of timber, cloth, and bodies absorbs the hard edges of the stone.

      The maker's space within the compound. The forge hearth is built of firebrick and granite with a dedicated flue and spark arrestor. Tool racks line the walls with organized precision. Work benches occupy the engineering bay. The cobbled floor has manure drains from the adjacent stables, and a masonry partition separates the fuel stores (charcoal/coal) from hay to prevent fire. Ridge vents and louvered gables provide strong ventilation, but the air still carries charcoal, hot metal, and oil.

      The warmest indoor zone, deliberately positioned near the kitchens for hot water access. Low ceilings retain heat. Internal timber partitions create distinct spaces: treatment room, warming bay with braziers on tile plates, herb preparation alcove, storage for linens and salves. Shuttered windows control light and drafts. Herb racks and drying lines fill the alcove and extend along the walls. The acoustic environment is intentionally muffled—a quiet space for healing.

      The logistical and assembly heart of the compound. Packed gravel and stone flags, crowned at center with marginal drains to stone channels. Training yard markings remain visible. The rain-fed cistern access hatch sits near the kitchen wall. During operations, it serves as assembly ground; during crises, as triage field. The hard surfaces yield crisp acoustics—voices and footfalls carry clearly.

      The primary entrance to the compound. Reinforced oak leaves with iron strapwork, draw-bolts, and crossbars. A murder-hole loft above for emergencies. The gate room houses 2-4 on access control with weapon racks, alarm bell access, and barricade kits staged. The space is designed for control—a chokepoint that can be held or sealed.

The views are the best in the compound—outward to the approaches, inward to the courtyard.
