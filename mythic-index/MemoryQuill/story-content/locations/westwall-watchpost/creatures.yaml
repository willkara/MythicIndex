creatures:
  - name: Wall Walker
    description: Spider-like constructs made of mortared stone that patrol the wall's surface. They repair small cracks and alert guards to structural damage. Created accidentally during wall construction, they've served faithfully for decades, maintaining the wall's integrity.
    visual_aspects:
      - Bodies appear to be living masonry with articulated stone legs
      - Size of large dogs with eight legs ending in mortar-tipped points
      - Blend perfectly with wall surface when motionless
      - Leave thin trails of fresh mortar where they walk
      - Eyes like dark windows in stone
    habitat:
      where: All surfaces of the wall and watchpost structures
      when: Constantly patrolling in predictable patterns
      why: Compulsion to maintain and repair stonework
    behavior:
      who: Population of 15-20 distributed across wall section
      what: Patrol surfaces, fill cracks, alert to damage
      how: Secrete stone-bonding compound; physically flag guards for major damage
    lore: Guards consider them good luck and unofficial mascots. Each has been named, and their patrol patterns are so reliable they're used for timekeeping. "Walker Three just passed, so it's near midnight." When one detected major foundation damage, its frantic behavior alerted engineers before disaster struck. They're credited with saving the wall section—and possibly the city.

  - name: Fog Hound
    description: Spectral dogs made of mist that patrol beyond the wall during foggy conditions. They bark warnings when threats approach and guide lost travelers to safety. Possibly the ghosts of guard dogs, possibly something stranger—no one knows for sure.
    visual_aspects:
      - Large hound shapes formed of swirling fog
      - Eyes glow yellow like lantern light through mist
      - Movement creates eddies and swirls in surrounding fog
      - Barks sound distant and echoing
      - Become more solid-looking when alarmed
    habitat:
      where: Beyond the wall during fog conditions
      when: Appear when fog rolls in; vanish when it clears
      why: Unknown; serve as advanced sentries
    behavior:
      who: Pack of 5-7 appearing consistently
      what: Patrol foggy areas, alert to threats, guide travelers
      how: Bark warnings that carry clearly to wall guards
    lore: Guards trust them implicitly. "If the Fog Hounds are barking, something's out there." They've given early warning of bandits, monsters, and once a small army approaching. A lost child was found by guards after Fog Hounds guided her directly to the gate, barking until Watch responded.

  - name: Sunset Crow
    description: A spectral crow that appears each evening at sunset to count the guards on duty. Its cawing matches the number of guards present—if the count is wrong, it circles the watchpost crying alarm until the discrepancy is explained. An early warning system for ambushes and absences.
    visual_aspects:
      - Large crow with feathers that shimmer gold and purple at sunset
      - Appears translucent but casts solid shadow
      - Eyes reflect sunset colors brilliantly
      - Call sounds like counting in Elvish
      - Perches on the highest point of the post
    habitat:
      where: Watchpost tower peak
      when: Appears precisely at sunset, vanishes after count
      why: Unknown; possibly blessing or curse from ancient magic
    behavior:
      who: Single entity appearing nightly for generations
      what: Counts guards on duty through cawing
      how: Number of caws equals number of guards present
    lore: The count is sacred ritual. Guards assemble at sunset to be counted, calling out as the crow caws. When the count came up short once, frantic search found a guard unconscious from a head injury—saved by the Sunset Crow's alarm. When it caws extra times with all guards present, they know an invisible or hidden intruder has joined the roster.

  - name: Arrow Spirit
    description: Faint glowing trails that show optimal firing solutions from defensive positions. Archers who follow the spirit-trails hit their targets with uncanny accuracy. The collective skill of every archer who's defended this post, made manifest.
    visual_aspects:
      - Faint luminous arcs showing trajectory paths
      - Glow intensifies when threat is in optimal range
      - Multiple trails show different firing solutions
      - Color shifts based on target type and distance
      - Visible only to those actively defending the post
    habitat:
      where: Visible from defensive positions throughout the watchpost
      when: Appear when defenders take position against threats
      why: Accumulated skill and sacrifice of generations of archers
    behavior:
      who: Collective presence of all who've defended this position
      what: Show optimal firing solutions for current threats
      how: Respond to defender's intent and target location
    lore: New archers are told to "trust the trails" during their first real defense. Following the spirit-trails, even inexperienced archers make shots they shouldn't be capable of. Veterans say it's the old guard still defending the wall, guiding the new. During a major attack, archers following the trails achieved nearly 90% hit rate—something normally impossible at those ranges.
