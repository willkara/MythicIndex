Looking at this request, I need to create a comprehensive location_imagery.yaml for the Westwall Watchpost based on the analyst's output and source files.

Let me extract the key visual anchors from the analysis:

**Signature Elements:**
- Twin stone towers (~52 ft main, ~44 ft secondary)
- Crenellated parapets with ~2 ft thick merlons
- Rectangular enceinte around central hardstand courtyard
- Smoke plumes from mess hall hearth and forge stack
- Limewash weather coat on masonry
- South gate with iron-strapped oak leaves
- Arrow slits with splayed embrasures
- Parapet walk connecting towers

**Materials:**
- Granite/limestone ashlar with rubble cores
- Oak and fir timber for trusses
- Wrought-iron hardware
- Slate roof tiles with clay ridge caps
- Limewash weather coat

**Color Anchors:**
- Granite grays, slate blue-black
- Oak honey-browns
- Limewash off-whites
- Seasonal herb and hay accents

**Light Behavior:**
- Knife-edged shadows from merlons
- Hearth glow spilling amber across flagstones
- Lantern halos along parapet at night
- Arrow slit light cutting beams across interior

Now let me plan the images based on the analyst's recommendations:

1. **Establishing** - Trade Way approach, twin towers, smoke plumes
2. **Essence** - Mess hall evening gathering
3. **Zone** - Tower aerie (Vera/Echo)
4. **Zone** - Workshop/forge (Grimjaw)
5. **Temporal** - Parapet walk at dawn
6. **Beat** - Courtyard triage (Battle for Westwall)
7. **Temporal** - Ruins after condemnation

The analyst also suggests characters:
- Vera - main tower aerie, command, parapet


- Grimjaw - forge/workshop
- Echo - aerie

I'll carefully consider the mood nuances for each character's visual representation. The establishing shot requires a delicate balance between dramatic energy and pastoral tranquility. For Grimjaw's forge scene, I'll emphasize the material authenticity of wrought iron and granite, capturing the intense labor and craftsmanship inherent in the workshop environment.

The pastoral mood offers a subtle approach to depicting the fortress - soft golden light revealing both strength and sanctuary. By selecting this mood, I can communicate the compound's dual nature: a place of military precision that still feels like home, with warm afternoon illumination softening the hard architectural lines.

For the mess hall, I'll capture the intimate essence of communal connection, focusing on a tender, warm light that highlights the found-family dynamic. The aerie becomes a solitary sanctuary, intimate in its quiet isolation. At the forge, I'll use a celebratory mood to showcase productive warmth, while the dawn parapet carries a somber weight of leadership. The courtyard triage pulses with kinetic energy, and the ruins resonate with a deep, grief-laden somber tone.
