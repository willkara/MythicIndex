# Westwall Watchpost – Inhabitants (Physical Usage Focus)

## Basic Demographics
- Typical Occupancy: 38–50 personnel during peak Company tenure; reduced to essential crews during non-operational nights.
- Role Types: Command (2–3), watch/guards (10–14 on duty cycles), specialists (engineering/forge 1–3, medical 1–2), logistics (1–2), kitchen/mess (2–4), stable/animal care (1–2), rotating City Watch (up to 10 distributed along walls).
- Visitor Throughput: Medical consultants, couriers, and Watch officers (1–6 at a time). Emergency surges during triage operations expand to 20–40 temporary occupants in the courtyard.
- Capacity Notes: Built fabric supports ~30 active defenders by pattern; conversions and bunking adjustments allow 40–50 total habitation with tight circulation in peak periods.

  - Stalls/Hay Storage: 8–10 stalls; 1–2 stablehands (day), 0–1 (night checks).
  - Workshop/Forge: 1–2 at forge during work blocks; 2–3 in engineering bay for repair/fabrication.

## Operational Rhythms
- Morning: Mess hall prep (2–4), stable/animal care (1–2), courtyard assembly (10–30), command/brief (2–3), parapet baseline (2–4).
- Midday: Workshop/forge block (2–4 total), storehouse issue (1–2), infirmary rounds (1–2), patrol turnover on towers (2–4 each).
- Evening: Mess peak (36–44 seating), kitchen/scullery (3–5), reduced workshop, increased parapet lantern line (4–8).
- Night: Gate/parapet minimal (4–6 across site), command standby (1), infirmary watch (0–1), stable checks (0–1).

## Notes
- Space allocations reflect physical circulation and safety: chokepoints at stair turns, stretcher routes to infirmary, and gate clearances maintained.
- Emergency expansion prioritizes courtyard triage and mess hall overflow; barricade kits enable rapid conversion of entrances into defensive chokepoints.
