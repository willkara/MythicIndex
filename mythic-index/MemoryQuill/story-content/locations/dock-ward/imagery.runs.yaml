        SCENARIO: forest of masts and spars emerging from fog, stone piers with bollards and capstans, wet cobblestones in foreground, timber cranes with block-and-tackle, burning lanterns on iron brackets, human figures for scale (silhouettes), fog obscuring distances, forest of masts and spars against perpetually grey sky, wet cobblestones gleaming with spray, mist, and puddles, hoist beams jutting over doorways like gallows arms, iron-banded doors in deep recessed loading bays, shuttered lantern brackets on iron stanchions, trench drains cut into heavy-traffic cobblestones, tar-darkened timber on piers, rails, and structural elements, rope coils, canvas, and rigging everywhere, The same warehouse lane, now transformed by night and rain. Wet cobblestones gleam like black mirrors, each lantern doubled in perfect reflection. Isolated pools of amber light punctuate significant darkness—one lantern here, another far down the lane, the spaces between them absolute. Rain runs through trench drains with audible purpose. The hoist beams are barely visible overhead, their hardware catching occasional glints. A single hooded figure moves through the middle distance, purpose evident in their pace. Shuttered windows and barred doors line the lane—the legitimate merchants are gone., Low angle emphasizing the reflective cobblestones, placing puddles prominently in foreground. The lantern pools create natural focal points through the depth of field. The figure provides human element and scale without dominating. The darkness between light pools is essential—not merely dim but actually dark., night, steady rain, light from isolated lanterns on iron brackets, warm amber pools separated by true darkness, warm lantern light against cold rain tones, rain streaks visible in light, fog of breath, dominant colors: wet black cobble, deep shadow, reflected amber; accent colors: lantern orange, rain-silver streaks, high fantasy, somber atmosphere, materials: salt-stained ashlar and brick, load-bearing at ground level, lime mortar, tarred plank and beam, weathered grey-black, pitch-sealed joints, rust-touched black iron—bands, hooks, hoists, bollards, brackets, Mood intent: Night rain transforms the Dock Ward into something cinematically beautiful in its melancholy—wet cobbles become mirrors, lanterns double in reflection, and the ward's usual chaos resolves into isolated pools of amber light. The somber mood captures this rain-washed beauty without sentimentalizing the hardship.
