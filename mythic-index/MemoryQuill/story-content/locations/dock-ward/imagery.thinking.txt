Let me analyze the input carefully and create a comprehensive location imagery specification for the Dock Ward.

From the analysis, I need to extract:
1. The narrative soul and essence
2. Physical truth and visual anchors
3. Zone information
4. Temporal states
5. Recommended images

Key elements to maintain across all images:
- Salt-stained ashlar and brick
- Tarred timber and plank
- Iron hardware (bands, hooks, hoists, lantern brackets)
- Rope and canvas everywhere
- Wet cobblestone and plank walkways
- Forest of masts and spars
- Hoist beams jutting over doorways
- Trench drains
- The eternal wet

The analyst has recommended 8 images:
1. ESTABLISHING (primary): Dawn waterfront with fog and masts
2. ZONE (primary): Warehouse lane at midday - the oppressive corridor
3. TEMPORAL (primary): Night with rain - lantern pools
4. ZONE (secondary): Market square chaos at midday
5. TEMPORAL (secondary): Storm conditions on wharves
6. ZONE (secondary): Company-adjacent blocks - steadier neighborhood
7. BEAT (secondary): Tenement fire (Chapter 3)
8. ZONE (optional): Pier underwalks at low tide

I need to convert the analyst's mood suggestions to my 8-mood system:
- "intimate" → INTIMATE
- "tense" → could be OMINOUS or KINETIC depending on context
- "somber" → SOMBER
- "triumphant" → CELEBRATORY
- "epic" → KINETIC (with epic scale)

Let me map the recommended moods:
1. Establishing at dawn with fog - analyst says "intimate" - I think SOMBER or ETHEREAL might work better for dawn fog, but the analyst says intimate which captures the quiet pre-activity state
2. Warehouse lane - "tense" - I'll use OMINOUS for the oppressive quality


3. Night rain - "somber" - SOMBER fits perfectly
4. Market chaos - "triumphant" - CELEBRATORY fits the energy
5. Storm - "epic" - KINETIC fits the dynamic energy
6. Company-adjacent - "intimate" - INTIMATE fits the calmer, more personal feeling
7. Tenement fire - "tense" - KINETIC fits the action, or OMINOUS for the dread
8. Pier underwalks - "somber" - SOMBER or OMINOUS for the dark, hidden space

I'll craft visual anchors that capture the Dock Ward's raw maritime essence. These signature elements will weave through every scene: weathered iron hardware, salt-crusted surfaces, and omnipresent moisture. Ropes, canvas, and timber create a textural language of maritime survival. Masts and spars form a skeletal backdrop, while trench drains and wet cobblestones speak to constant maritime movement and environmental challenge.

The material palette tells a story of endurance - salt-stained masonry, tar-darkened timber, rust-touched iron. Each surface bears witness to constant maritime assault: wind, water, and human labor. Color emerges in muted tones - grey-brown stone, tar-black wood, rust-black metal - creating a unified visual language of resilience and decay.

Light becomes a critical narrative element, transforming the urban landscape. Daytime brings filtered, diffuse illumination through perpetual fog, casting deep shadows in narrow lanes. Nighttime transforms the scene into isolated amber pools of lantern light, punctuating significant darkness. Rain turns cobblestones into liquid mirrors, reflecting and fragmenting these warm glows.
