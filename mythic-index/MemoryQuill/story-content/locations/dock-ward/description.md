# Dock Ward – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- **Location & Terrain**: Low-lying waterfront ward built along worked wharves and timber piers, with streets that rise inland toward the higher wards. The ground is hard-worn cobble and plank, constantly wet with mist, spray, and washdown.
- **Environmental Factors**: Salt air, fog banks, sudden squalls, and storm-driven spray. Slick surfaces and pooled runoff are persistent hazards; smells and smoke cling in the still air between tall buildings.
- **Approach Routes**: Major ward entries via the city’s arterial streets and gate spurs; internal movement through a mesh of narrow lanes, pier walks, and service alleys behind warehouse faces.

## Architectural Overview
- **Construction Style**: Waterdeep working waterfront—functional, compact, and layered. Ground floors favor load-bearing stone, heavy timbers, and iron hardware; upper levels and infill trend to timber frame and patched masonry, built for occupancy rather than beauty.
- **Primary Materials**: Salt-stained ashlar and brick; tarred timber and plank; iron-banded doors, hooks, and hoists; rope lines and canvas; lantern brackets and glass panes protected by shutters.
- **Street Character**: Tight corridors between tall warehouse walls; recessed loading bays; hoist beams and pulley blocks over doors; trench drains where traffic is heaviest; scattered sand bins and water barrels where fire risk is high.

## District Anatomy (Practical Zones)
### Working Wharves & Piers
- Forests of masts and spars; gangplanks, bollards, and capstans set into the stone.
- Cargo cranes and block-and-tackle rigs; tar pots and pitch work areas; fish-cleaning stations with constant washdown.

### Warehouse Lanes
- Narrow streets with high walls and few windows; deep door recesses to protect goods from rain and casual theft.
- Elevated catwalks and loft hatches; wheeled carts that rattle over cobbles; rope chandlers and sail-makers wedged between shipping offices.

### Company-Adjacent Blocks (Near the Warehouse Complex)
- Closer to the Company’s walled compound, the ward’s churn organizes itself: steadier Watch attention, brighter lantern brackets, and fewer people willing to start trouble where trained responders live.
- Local faces recognize the Company by sight; directions come easier, and crowds make room without needing to be pushed.

### Markets & Taverns
- Damp squares filled with shouting vendors, rumbling carts, and sharp fish-salt smells.
- Taverns and cookshops present bright, warm thresholds against gray weather; back rooms serve as hiring halls, rumor mills, and meeting points.

### Tenements & Back Lanes
- Mixed-use stacks: commerce below, crowded living above; stairs that run narrow and steep.
- Basements and rear sheds sometimes house unlicensed trades—dangerous when alchemical work is involved.

## Hazards & Emergency Features
- **Fire**: Dense construction, stored oils, and occasional illicit workshops make fast-moving blazes a recurring threat. Alarm bells, bucket lines, and sand bins are the ward’s first line of response.
- **Water**: Tides and storms can turn alleys into channels; low-tide under-walks provide movement routes but also trap the unwary in surge conditions.
- **Crowds & Opportunism**: The ward’s constant churn creates cover for pickpockets, smugglers, and quiet off-ledger exchanges—most of it avoidable if you know where to walk, when to speak, and whose space you’re crossing.

## Immersive Sensory Environment
- **Smell**: Brine and seaweed, fish and smoke, tar and rope fiber; occasional sharp chemical notes when alchemy is near.
- **Sound**: Bells, shouted numbers, gulls, rigging snaps, hammer-on-iron repairs, cart wheels grinding on cobbles.
- **Texture**: Wet stone underfoot, tacky pitch on timber rails, salt-grit on skin and gear, rope burns on hands.

## Temporal & Seasonal Variations
- **Dawn**: Shift changes and unload schedules; fog and muted silhouettes of masts.
- **Midday**: Markets peak; the ward becomes a moving maze of carts and crews.
- **Night**: Legitimate merchants shutter up; lantern pools isolate pockets of activity; illicit movement increases in back lanes.
- **Storm Season**: Wind-driven spray and surge forces work inland; mooring lines sing and strain; building faces take a pounding.
