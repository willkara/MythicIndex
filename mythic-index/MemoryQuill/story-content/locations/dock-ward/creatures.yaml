creatures:
  - name: Tide Skulker
    description: Amphibious scavengers that emerge from the harbor at low tide to hunt through dock waste and forgotten cargo. They've adapted to city life, learning to open crates and barrels. Their intelligence is unsettling—they use tools and seem to understand human schedules.
    visual_aspects:
      - Hunched, bipedal form about 4 feet tall with mottled green-gray skin
      - Webbed hands with opposable thumbs and sharp claws
      - Large, reflective eyes adapted for murky water and dim docks
      - Covered in barnacles and seaweed that provide natural camouflage
      - Smell overwhelmingly of brine, fish, and rot
    habitat:
      where: Harbor waters, tide pools under piers, storm drains and flooded cellars
      when: Most active at low tide and during night; retreat underwater at dawn
      why: Feed on dock waste, fish, and occasionally raid food stores
    behavior:
      who: Live in loose colonies of 6-12 beneath specific pier sections
      what: Use primitive tools to open containers and navigate urban infrastructure
      how: Coordinate raids during shift changes when docks are least watched
    lore: Dockworkers have an uneasy truce with Tide Skulkers—leave them scraps and they don't raid cargo. Break the truce, and whole shipments vanish overnight. Some swear they've seen Skulkers trading with fence operations in the deep night.

  - name: Tar Serpent
    description: Snake-like creatures that live in pitch barrels and tar storage. Their bodies are coated in a thick, sticky substance that both protects and immobilizes prey. They've become a serious problem in shipyards where tar is stored for waterproofing.
    visual_aspects:
      - 6-8 feet long, diameter of a human arm
      - Completely black and glistening with thick tar coating
      - Yellow eyes with vertical slit pupils
      - Drip trails of sticky tar wherever they move
      - Can compress body to fit through surprising small gaps
    habitat:
      where: Tar storage facilities, pitch cauldrons, dark warehouses with caulking supplies
      when: Active year-round; most mobile when tar supplies are replenished
      why: Feed on rodents and birds attracted to grain warehouses; absorb tar for protection
    behavior:
      who: Solitary but tolerate others in rich feeding territories
      what: Coat themselves in fresh tar regularly; spray tar to immobilize prey
      how: Ambush from storage containers, using tar to stick prey in place
    lore: More than one drunk dock worker has stumbled into what they thought was a coiled rope, only to be stuck fast. Tar Serpents aren't aggressive to humans, but their defensive spray has caused drownings when victims panic and fall into the harbor.

  - name: Plank Gremlin
    description: Mischievous fey creatures that infest wooden docks and ship timbers. They cause boards to rot prematurely, ropes to fray at crucial moments, and cargo to mysteriously shift. Invisible to most, they reveal themselves only to those who offend them.
    visual_aspects:
      - Small humanoids about 1 foot tall when visible
      - Bodies appear to be made of sodden, rotting wood
      - Long, spindly fingers that leave wet prints on dry surfaces
      - Eyes like rusty nails set in wooden faces
      - Become visible as grotesque carved figureheads when angry
    habitat:
      where: Wooden docks, ship hulls, rope storage, and timber yards
      when: Constant presence; most active during storms and high tides
      why: Feed on the life force of aging wood; delight in causing minor disasters
    behavior:
      who: Colonies of dozens infesting entire dock sections or ships
      what: Accelerate wood rot, weaken ropes, trip workers, spoil cargo
      how: Mostly invisible; work collectively to cause cascading failures
    lore: Sailors know a dozen rituals to appease Plank Gremlins—coins in bilgewater, rum poured on new timber, specific knot patterns in rigging. Shipwrights who ignore the rituals watch their work fall apart. Those who maintain respect have mysteriously lucky vessels.

  - name: Harbor Gloom
    description: Thick, living fog banks that roll in from the harbor carrying whispers and visions. Those caught in a Harbor Gloom experience vivid hallucinations of drowning, shipwrecks, and sailors lost at sea. The fog seems to feed on fear and sorrow.
    visual_aspects:
      - Dense fog patches with unusual purple-gray coloration
      - Moves against natural wind patterns with purpose
      - Contains swirling shapes that briefly resemble drowning victims
      - Droplets of moisture feel oily and cold on skin
      - Accompanied by sounds of distant bells and muffled cries
    habitat:
      where: Harbor waters and dock areas, especially near memorial sites
      when: Forms during funerals, storms, and anniversaries of maritime disasters
      why: Manifestation of collective grief and tragedy from centuries of harbor deaths
    behavior:
      who: Single quasi-sentient phenomenon or multiple related entities
      what: Envelops victims in hallucinations of maritime tragedy
      how: Feeds on emotional resonance; grows denser when fear is present
    lore: Old harbor hands claim each Harbor Gloom contains the memories of a specific shipwreck. Some families deliberately seek them out, hoping for visions of lost loved ones. Most just try to get indoors when the purple fog rolls in.
