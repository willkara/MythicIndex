# Dock Ward – Overview

## Basic Information
- **Type**: Harbor district / working ward
- **Region**: Waterdeep (waterfront)
- **Coordinates/Position**: Along the city’s docks and wharves; streets climb inland toward the higher wards
- **First Appearance**: Chapter 3 (The First Spark) – the Dock Ward tenement fire
- **Significance Level**: Moderate (recurring setting; logistics and threat vector)

## Quick Description
Waterdeep’s Dock Ward is a dense, working waterfront of tar-darkened timbers, salt-stained stone, rope chandlers and sail-makers, warehouses packed tight against narrow streets, and a constant churn of carts, crews, and tide-driven labor. The air is thick with brine, fish, pitch, and smoke; the soundscape is bell-peals, gulls, shouted numbers, and rigging snapping in the wind.

## Visual Summary
- Timber piers and wharves bristling with masts; cranes and capstans set into wet cobbles
- Narrow lanes between tall, window-sparse warehouses; iron-banded doors and loading hoists
- Tenements and back rooms above ground-floor commerce; cluttered signage, lantern brackets, and rope lines
- Market stalls in damp squares: shouting vendors, rumbling carts, fish-salt and seaweed underfoot

## Story Role
- **Plot Relevance**:
  - Early proving ground for the Company’s urban response (Chapter 3 tenement fire and aftermath)
  - Ongoing logistics backdrop (shipments, markets, meeting points, and cover identities)
  - Proximity to the Company’s Dock Ward billet/HQ site (`dock-ward-warehouse-complex`)
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Industry and survival—order wrestled from chaos, one bell-peal at a time
- **Recurring Location**: Yes (referenced across multiple chapters as a lived-in ward)

## Key Features
- **Notable Landmarks**: Working wharves, warehouse rows, market squares, ropewalks and chandlers, sail lofts
- **Unique Aspects**: Dense mixed-use construction; heavy reliance on tide and weather; constant motion and noise
- **Hazards/Dangers**: Fire (especially where alchemical goods or workshops are present), crowd crush, storm surge and slick cobbles; after-dark opportunists in quieter alleys
- **Resources/Attractions**: Labor and shipping access, supplies and repair trades, abundant cover for clandestine movement

## Connections
- **Connected Locations**:
  - *Dock Ward Warehouse Complex*: The Company’s secured compound one block off the working wharves
  - *Castle Ward / Artisan Row*: Upslope workshops and guild offices (including `cids-workshop` and `korraths-office`)
- **Transportation Methods**: Foot traffic, wagons, small boats, cargo skiffs along pier faces and harbor slips
- **Distance from Other Key Locations**: A short wagon ride from Watch infrastructure; within a day’s city movement of most wards

## Accessibility
- **Who Can Access**: The public; sailors, merchants, and dockworkers; Watch patrols
- **Restrictions**: Informal territorial lines (dock crews, guild influence, pier rights); some piers are private or gated
- **Hidden Aspects**: Quiet deals, disguised storage, and “legitimate” businesses that keep paperwork clean while moving sensitive cargo
- **Secret Paths/Entrances**: Service alleys, loft ladders, pier under-walks at low tide

## Notes
*Use `dock-ward` as the broad district wrapper for scenes that aren’t tied to a single named building. For specific recurring interiors, prefer dedicated profiles like `dock-ward-warehouse-complex`.*

*Company-adjacent blocks (around `dock-ward-warehouse-complex`) skew more orderly: more lantern light, more Watch attention, and more familiar faces.*
