The user wants me to analyze the Dock Ward location from their story. Let me go through my analytical framework systematically.

This is a district-level location, not a specific building like the warehouse complex. It's the broader urban environment that contains the Company's HQ and serves as a recurring setting for scenes.

Let me extract the key elements:

**Physical Truth:**
- Working waterfront district
- Dense mixed-use construction
- Salt-stained stone and tarred timber
- Narrow lanes between tall warehouses
- Wet cobbles, constant spray
- Masts, piers, cranes, capstans
- Lantern brackets, iron-banded doors
- Hoist beams over doorways

**Narrative Soul:**
- First significant urban proving ground (Chapter 3 tenement fire)
- Logistics backdrop
- Industry and survival - order wrestled from chaos
- The Company's "neighborhood"

**Zones:**
1. Working Wharves & Piers (the waterfront edge)
2. Warehouse Lanes (commerce corridors)
3. Company-Adjacent Blocks (safer, steadier)
4. Markets & Taverns (social hubs)
5. Tenements & Back Lanes (where trouble lives)

**Temporal States:**
- Dawn: fog, muted silhouettes, shift changes
- Midday: chaos, carts, crews, peak activity
- Night: shuttered, lantern pools, illicit movement
- Storm: wind-driven spray, mooring lines singing

**Character-Space Relationships:**
The documentation doesn't name specific characters, but the Company as a collective entity has a relationship with this district. The Company-adjacent blocks are "steadier" because of their presence.

**Key Story Beat:**
Chapter 3 - The tenement fire. This is the early proving ground mentioned.

Let me structure this analysis now.

For recommended images:
1. Establishing shot of the ward - waterfront chaos
2. Zone-specific: Working wharves at dawn


3. Zone-specific: Warehouse lane atmosphere
4. Temporal: Night in the Dock Ward - lantern pools
5. Storm conditions
6. Company-adjacent blocks - the "steadier" feel
7. The market square chaos

I aim to capture the district's essence as a living, breathing urban ecosystem. Each zone pulses with its own rhythm - from the frenetic market squares to the brooding warehouse lanes. The atmosphere shifts dramatically across different times of day, revealing layers of urban complexity. It's less about individual structures and more about the interconnected energy of a maritime industrial landscape.

The recommended visual sequence tells a narrative of urban transformation, showing how light, activity, and mood change across different district zones and temporal states. This approach emphasizes the Dock Ward as a dynamic character in its own right, not just a static backdrop.
