# Dock Ward – Inhabitants & Culture

## Common Populations
- **Dockworkers & Stevedores**: Organized crews who know each pier’s rhythms, weights, and hazards.
- **Sailors & Shipwrights**: Constant turnover of faces; long-term locals recognize the regular captains.
- **Merchants & Factors**: Public prosperity on the front, private ledgers in the back.
- **Market Vendors**: Fishmongers, produce hawkers, rope and canvas sellers; loud voices and quick hands.
- **City Watch Patrols**: Present but stretched—more containment than control in peak hours.

## Ward Power Structures (Informal)
- **Crews & Dock Bosses**: Territorial influence over specific piers, taverns, and hiring halls.
- **Guild Influence**: Rope chandlers, sail-makers, and shipping interests shape what “counts” as legitimate work.
- **Rumor Economy**: News moves faster than carts; favors and warnings travel pier-to-pier by habit.

## How the Ward Treats Outsiders
- Strangers are sized up quickly—by boots, hands, and whether they know how to move around carts without being hit.
- Respect is practical: competence earns it; arrogance gets you lost, jostled, or both.

## Story-Relevant Notes
- The Dock Ward is the Company’s recurring city-side staging backdrop and supply vector.
- The Company’s secured billet and operations hub is profiled separately as `dock-ward-warehouse-complex`.
- Blocks near the Company’s HQ run a little steadier: more lantern light, more Watch eyes, and locals who know the Company by sight.
