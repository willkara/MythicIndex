  The Dock Ward is Waterdeep's working heartbeat—a dense waterfront where
  tar-darkened timbers meet salt-stained stone, where masts bristle like
  a forest, and where order is wrestled from chaos one bell-peal at a time.
  In this district, the Company found its purpose: when a tenement blazed
  with phosphorus flame and Veyra's battlefield experience recognized what
  water would do, when her voice cut through chaos to save lives, when the
  sealed basement taught them the bitter cost of insufficient resources.
  The Dock Ward is where competence proves itself in crisis, where legends
  are forged in fire, and where the Last Light Company first understood
  what it needed to become.
