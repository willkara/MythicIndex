    toward the harbor. A forest of masts and spars emerges from thick fog, their\ 

    rigging lines barely visible, creating a ghostly vertical rhythm against pale\ 

    grey sky. Stone piers thrust into the murk, their bollards and capstans catching\ 

    the first diffuse light. Pier-caps and bollards are carved with sea-ward glyphs—harbor\ 

    safety sigils meant to steady lines, quiet rot, and warn of bad tides. In the\ 

    foreground, wet cobblestones gleam with overnight condensation, a few lanterns still\ 

    burning on iron brackets—some of them everburning ward-lanterns in bronze cages, their\ 

    warm amber arcane flame built to cut fog and sea-wind. Timber cranes loom like skeletal\ 

    giants. A handful of early workers move as silhouettes—small figures dwarfed by the\ 

    scale of commerce, their shapes hinting at Waterdeep’s mixed crowd: a dragonborn\ 

    stevedore, a dwarf sailor, a halfling runner vanishing into mist. The first bells are\ 

    about to ring. The ward is present but not yet fully alive.\n"

            SCENARIO: dense crowd of dock workers and merchants, a mixed Faerûn crowd in the press (dragonborn, dwarves, tieflings, halflings), vendor stalls with fish and produce piled high, shouting vendors with open mouths, wet canvas-covered tables, rumbling carts and wheeled traffic, fish-salt and seaweed underfoot, warm tavern doorway in background, never-quite-dry cobblestones, forest of masts and spars against perpetually grey sky, wet cobblestones gleaming with spray, mist, and puddles, hoist beams jutting over doorways like gallows arms, iron-banded doors in deep recessed loading bays, shuttered lantern brackets on iron stanchions, trench drains cut into heavy-traffic cobblestones, tar-darkened timber on piers, rails, and structural elements, rope coils, canvas, and rigging everywhere, everburning ward-lanterns in bronze cages—warm amber arcane flame, built for fog and sea-wind, pier-caps and bollards carved with sea-ward glyphs and harbor-safety sigils (functional magic, not decoration), cargo crates stamped with shimmering alchemical-ink marks—guild seals, customs wards, and anti-tamper sigils that show up when wet, a mixed Faerûn crowd in the periphery when figures appear: dragonborn stevedores, dwarf sailors, tiefling fishmongers, halfling runners, A damp market square packed with stalls and carts at midday peak. Vendors shout prices with mouths open, competing for attention. Fish and produce pile high on wet canvas-covered tables—silver scales glinting, root vegetables mud-crusted, salt-cured meats hanging from hooks. The crowd is dense: dock workers in rough canvas, merchants in better wool, housekeepers with baskets— and a mixed Faerûn crowd in the press: a dragonborn stevedore hauling a crate, a dwarf sailor bargaining over salt fish, a tiefling fishmonger with ink-stained fingers, halfling runners slipping between carts. Subtle working-magic is everywhere: fish laid on rune-chilled slate, crates stamped with shimmering alchemical-ink guild seals that bead bright when wet, ward-lanterns in bronze cages burning steady through mist. Rumbling cart wheels compete with shouted numbers. In the background, a tavern doorway glows warm against the grey day. The square is never quite dry—wet cobbles, fish-salt and seaweed underfoot, the smell of brine and commerce., Faerûn high-fantasy interior cues (subtle, believable magic): enchanted lanterns/sconces, rune-inlaid beams, warding motifs worked into stone and metal, arcane guild seals and sigils as functional infrastructure, Narrative context: This is where the ward's working people actually live their lives—not the oppressive lanes or fog-bound piers, but the messy vitality of commerce and community. The Company passes through here for supplies, for information, for the pulse of the neighborhood., Eye-level in the crowd, creating immersion in the chaos. Multiple layers of activity create depth—foreground transaction, mid-ground crowd, background tavern. The eye should feel overwhelmed, unable to focus on one thing. The warm tavern doorway provides visual anchor and contrast., midday, overcast, not raining, light from diffuse daylight through overcast, flat grey light with no shadows, ambient, neutral grey with warm tavern accent tones, minimal—open square shadows, damp air, slight mist, dominant colors: grey overcast sky, wet stone cobbles, rough wool and canvas clothing, fish silver; accent colors: tavern doorway amber, produce colors m..., high fantasy, celebratory atmosphere, materials: salt-stained ashlar and brick, load-bearing at ground level, lime mortar, tarred plank and beam, weather...

            , epic high-fantasy exterior, fantastical silhouettes and skyline, arcane lanterns and ward-lights, subtle magical phenomena integrated into the environment, dynamic skies, cinematic composition, atmospheric depth, Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            - character portraits (identity references)

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Avoid “real-world medieval Europe” drift; keep fantasy species variety and magical infrastructure plausible and grounded-in-world (not neon).

            SCENARIO: fire in upper windows of timber-frame tenement, billowing smoke, Company members in coordinated bucket line, figures directing residents to safety, watching ward residents in doorways, a mixed Faerûn crowd among the ward residents (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn), narrow steep tenement stairs visible, fire-light as primary illumination, sharp contrast between discipline and chaos, forest of masts and spars against perpetually grey sky, wet cobblestones gleaming with spray, mist, and puddles, hoist beams jutting over doorways like gallows arms, iron-banded doors in deep recessed loading bays, shuttered lantern brackets on iron stanchions, trench drains cut into heavy-traffic cobblestones, tar-darkened timber on piers, rails, and structural elements, rope coils, canvas, and rigging everywhere, everburning ward-lanterns in bronze cages—warm amber arcane flame, built for fog and sea-wind, pier-caps and bollards carved with sea-ward glyphs and harbor-safety sigils (functional magic, not decoration), cargo crates stamped with shimmering alchemical-ink marks—guild seals, customs wards, and anti-tamper sigils that show up when wet, a mixed Faerûn crowd in the periphery when figures appear: dragonborn stevedores, dwarf sailors, tiefling fishmongers, halfling runners, A narrow tenement street at night, fire providing the primary light. Smoke billows from upper windows of a cramped timber-frame building—the kind of construction that burns fast. In the foreground and middle ground, Company members work in coordinated motion: a bucket line, figures directing residents to safety, someone managing the crowd. Their discipline is visible— organized movements against the chaos of fleeing civilians. Ward residents watch from doorways and windows: faces showing surprise, skepticism, the beginning of impressed. The narrow steep stairs of tenement construction are visible. Fire-light paints everything in harsh orange and black, casting long sharp shadows. The watching crowd is unmistakably Faerûn—human dockhands shoulder-to-shoulder with a dwarf sailor, a tiefling mother pulling a child back, a dragonborn stevedore passing a bucket with brutal efficiency. On a few doorframes, quick chalk rune-marks indicate cleared stairwells and safe routes—practical field marks, not spellcasting., Faerûn high-fantasy interior cues (subtle, believable magic): enchanted lanterns/sconces, rune-inlaid beams, warding motifs worked into stone and metal, arcane guild seals and sigils as functional infrastructure, Narrative context: This is the moment the Company proves what they are to a ward that doesn't know them. Before this, they're strangers with discipline. After, they're the people who showed up and knew what to do.

            2. FANTASY TONE: This is a high-fantasy world (D&D / Faerûn vibe). Include subtle magical infrastructure (runes, enchanted lanterns, ward-stones, guild sigils) where appropriate.

            3. NO FACE CLONING: If people appear, keep them generic and varied—do not repeat an identical face across images unless explicitly required.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            SCENARIO: barnacle-crusted wooden pilings, seaweed draping from cross-timbers, slick stone and sand footing, water lapping in shadows, filtered light through pier planks above, warning sea-ward glyphs carved into a few pilings (subtle, barnacle-worn), the sense of borrowed space, mysterious depth into darkness, forest of masts and spars against perpetually grey sky, wet cobblestones gleaming with spray, mist, and puddles, hoist beams jutting over doorways like gallows arms, iron-banded doors in deep recessed loading bays, shuttered lantern brackets on iron stanchions, trench drains cut into heavy-traffic cobblestones, tar-darkened timber on piers, rails, and structural elements, rope coils, canvas, and rigging everywhere, everburning ward-lanterns in bronze cages—warm amber arcane flame, built for fog and sea-wind, pier-caps and bollards carved with sea-ward glyphs and harbor-safety sigils (functional magic, not decoration), cargo crates stamped with shimmering alchemical-ink marks—guild seals, customs wards, and anti-tamper sigils that show up when wet, a mixed Faerûn crowd in the periphery when figures appear: dragonborn stevedores, dwarf sailors, tiefling fishmongers, halfling runners, Low tide reveals the space beneath the wharves: a dark forest of barnacle- crusted pilings stretching into shadow. Seaweed drapes from cross-timbers like decayed curtains. The footing is treacherous—slick exposed stone and sand scattered with debris. Water laps and slaps in the darkness, the sound carrying strangely. Filtered light penetrates through gaps in the pier planks above, creating narrow shafts that illuminate particles of suspended matter. The smell is low tide: brine and rot and the things that live in darkness. On a few pilings, warning glyphs are carved deep—sea-wards and salvage sigils meant to keep workers alive, half-obscured by barnacles. In the deepest shadow, faint phosphorescent lichen traces broken rune-shapes along the wood, just enough to suggest the world is stranger than it should be. This is not a human space—it's borrowed territory, and the water will return., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: The underwalks represent the ward's hidden layer: secret paths, escape routes, clandestine meetings. Anyone using them is either desperate or doing something that can't be done in daylight. The Company knows they exist, knows people use them, factors them into their threat assessments., Low angle looking through the forest of pilings, creating mysterious depth. The pilings should feel like trees in a drowned forest—regular but organic, crusted with life. Light shafts from above create focal points but also emphasize the surrounding darkness. No human figures—this is not a space for lingering., irrelevant—perpetual shadow, irrelevant, light from filtered daylight through pier gaps, narrow shafts in darkness, top-down in spots, cold grey-green tones, near absolute between shafts shadows, damp, particles in light shafts, dominant colors: black shadow, barnacle grey-white, seaweed brown-green, wet stone dark grey; accent colors: light shaft grey, water glint, high fantasy, ominous atmosphere, materials: salt-stained ashlar and brick, load-bearing at ground ...

            , epic high-fantasy exterior, fantastical silhouettes and skyline, arcane lanterns and ward-lights, subtle magical phenomena integrated into the environment, dynamic skies, cinematic composition, atmospheric depth, Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.
