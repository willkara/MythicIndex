creatures:
  - name: Silver Grub
    description: Bioluminescent larvae that feed on silver ore and leave glowing trails through mine tunnels. While not dangerous, their presence indicates rich veins—or structural weaknesses where they've honeycombed the rock. Their light has saved many miners from collapse zones.
    visual_aspects:
      - Segmented bodies 6-12 inches long, translucent with visible internal organs
      - Emit soft silver-blue bioluminescence from entire body
      - Leave trails of glowing residue that persist for hours
      - Clusters create pools of light in dark galleries
      - Pupate into Silver Moths that flutter through upper shafts
    habitat:
      where: Deep silver veins and ore deposits; migrate through rock cracks
      when: Active year-round in constant underground temperatures
      why: Feed exclusively on silver ore and certain mineral salts
    behavior:
      who: Exist in loose colonies, following ore veins like living prospectors
      what: Bore through rock and ore, creating intricate tunnel networks
      how: Secrete mild acid that dissolves silver-bearing stone; harmless to flesh
    lore: Miners consider them good luck omens. "Follow the grubs to riches, heed their absence as warning." Areas where grubs suddenly abandon often collapse within days. Some believe they can sense stress in stone.

  - name: Stone Eater
    description: Armored arthropods that consume solid rock and excrete fine gravel. About the size of large dogs, they help naturally expand mining operations but can destabilize tunnels if populations boom. Their mandibles can chew through pick handles and support timber.
    visual_aspects:
      - Segmented carapace of interlocking stone-gray plates
      - Size of a large dog, low-slung with six powerful legs
      - Mandibles like curved picks that constantly grind and flex
      - Leave piles of fine-ground stone "tailings" behind them
      - Sound like grinding millstones when feeding
    habitat:
      where: Active and abandoned mine tunnels; prefer softer sedimentary layers
      when: Continuous activity; feed constantly to maintain metabolism
      why: Digest trace minerals from rock; create burrows for reproduction
    behavior:
      who: Solitary but tolerate others in rich feeding areas
      what: Methodically consume rock faces, creating new passages
      how: Use powerful mandibles and digestive enzymes to break down stone
    lore: Smart miners learn to redirect Stone Eaters toward desired expansion areas by "salting" rock faces with mineral supplements. Some mines have used domesticated Stone Eaters for generations, treating them as living mining equipment.

  - name: Echo Bat
    description: Blind bats with supernatural echolocation that can detect structural flaws and gas pockets through solid rock. Their calls reveal mine stability to those who understand their language. They nest only in safe areas, making their roosts valuable indicators.
    visual_aspects:
      - Completely eyeless with smooth skin where eyes should be
      - Large, elaborate ear structures like radar dishes
      - Fur patterns of gray and brown mimicking rock strata
      - Size of small cats with wingspans of 2-3 feet
      - Produce ultrasonic clicks audible as faint crystal chimes to humans
    habitat:
      where: Stable galleries and chambers with good air circulation
      when: Active during shifts; retreat when blasting or heavy work occurs
      why: Feed on underground insects; roost only in structurally sound areas
    behavior:
      who: Colonies of 20-50 that collectively map entire mine systems
      what: Create sonic maps of mine stability through coordinated echolocation
      how: Different call patterns indicate different hazards to trained listeners
    lore: Experienced miners learn Echo Bat "songs"—rapid clicking means solid rock, slow pulses indicate cracks, and silence means imminent danger. The Blackvein collapse was preceded by total Echo Bat abandonment twelve hours prior.

  - name: Dust Devil
    description: Small whirlwinds of animated stone dust and mineral particles that form in areas of high stress and poor ventilation. Not truly alive but persistent magical phenomena that indicate dangerous conditions. They can suffocate those caught in their vortex.
    visual_aspects:
      - Swirling columns of glittering dust 3-6 feet tall
      - Contain fragments of crystal and metal that catch lamplight
      - Cores glow faintly with heat from friction
      - Move with purposeful, searching patterns
      - Leave spiral patterns in settled dust on floors and walls
    habitat:
      where: Poorly ventilated dead-end galleries and areas of geological stress
      when: Form spontaneously during temperature changes or before collapses
      why: Manifestation of trapped air currents and accumulated magical energy
    behavior:
      who: Individual phenomena lasting hours to days
      what: Seek out living beings, possibly drawn to breath and body heat
      how: Engulf victims, causing choking and disorientation
    lore: Dwarven miners treat Dust Devils as angry spirits of the mountain, warning of disrespect or impending danger. They're often seen before cave-ins, earning the name "death dancers." Smart crews evacuate any area where multiple Dust Devils form.

  - name: Ore Wraith
    description: Spectral manifestations of miners who died in collapses, bound to the silver they died seeking. They appear as translucent, silvery figures still performing their final tasks. Mostly harmless unless the ore they're bound to is disturbed, then they become violently territorial.
    visual_aspects:
      - Ghostly humanoid forms with dwarven or human features
      - Bodies appear carved from tarnished silver, semi-transparent
      - Still wear spectral versions of their final equipment
      - Eyes glow like lamplight through fog
      - Movement trails silvery mist that settles as fine dust
    habitat:
      where: Collapse sites and rich veins where miners died
      when: Manifest strongest during the hours they died; fade at shift changes
      why: Bound by unfinished work or the shock of sudden death
    behavior:
      who: Individual spirits tied to specific deaths and locations
      what: Endlessly repeat their final moments—digging, running, or calling for help
      how: Usually ignore the living unless ore is removed; then attack to "protect" their claim
    lore: The Blackvein Lode's collapse created dozens of new Ore Wraiths. Survivors report seeing them still digging, still trying to escape, unaware they're already dead. Dwarven priests perform silver-coin rituals to help them rest, but some refuse to leave their veins.
