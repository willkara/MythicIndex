    The Blackvein Lode is a wound in the mountain that demands respect. It has swallowed
    overconfident miners and spat them back as lessons. It doesn't hate those who dig into
    its bones—it simply operates on geological time, indifferent to human urgency. Those
    who listen to its creaks and groans earn the right to take its silver. Those who don't
    listen earn its silence, forever.

    The establishing shot captures the mine during the crisis—a site of ongoing danger
    and desperate hope. The mountain looms as antagonist, the human infrastructure
    fragile against its scale.

  visual_description: |
    The Blackvein Lode clings to a steep mountain slope, its timber headframe rising
    against slate-blue peaks. Benched terraces hold the clustered infrastructure:
    the main shaft collar with its iron-banded stone ring, the capstan and hoist
    rigging, the lamproom and tool house offset leeward. Fracture flags snap in the
    wind along the ridgeline, marking stress zones. Ventilation collars with louvered
    shutters dot the upper slope, their canvas windsocks indicating airflow. Dry-stone
    retaining walls step down toward tailings slopes below. The approach trail
    switchbacks up from the valley, narrow and treacherous.

  composition_notes: |
    Wide establishing shot from the approach trail, looking up at the mine complex.
    The headframe as focal point, mountain peaks framing above. The benched terraces

  narrative_significance: |
    This is where the Last Light Company first proved themselves—and learned their
