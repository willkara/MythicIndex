It is a rough-hewn wooden stake, painted with a band of yellow ochre, bearing a strip of red cloth tied near the top. The cloth snaps violently in the mountain wind, blurred by motion, showing the force of the air. The wood of the stake is splintered where it was driven into the scree.

        SCENARIO: rough wooden stake with yellow paint band, red cloth strip snapping in wind, rocky scree ground texture, motion blur on the cloth, headframe silhouette in soft background, slate-blue sky context, Close-up of a 'Fracture Flag' planted in the rocky ground of the mine yard. It is a rough-hewn wooden stake, painted with a band of yellow ochre, bearing a strip of red cloth tied near the top. The cloth snaps violently in the mountain wind, blurred by motion, showing the force of the air. The wood of the stake is splintered where it was driven into the scree. In the background, soft out of focus, the dark timber skeleton of the headframe rises against the slate-blue sky. This is the language of danger: simple, improvised, urgent., Narrative context: These flags appear throughout the Blackvein chapters as markers of the Company's growing realization of the danger. They represent the specialized knowledge the Company lacks—the ability to read the mountain. Showing one up close makes the threat tangible., Low angle close-up. The stake and cloth dominate the foreground. The snapping motion of the cloth should be palpable (motion blur). Background headframe provides context but remains secondary.
