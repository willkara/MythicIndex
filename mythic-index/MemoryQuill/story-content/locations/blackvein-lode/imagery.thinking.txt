This is a request to create location imagery specifications for Blackvein Lode, a mining operation that serves as the site of the Last Light Company's first official contract and where they recruit Grimjaw Ironbeard.

Let me analyze what I've received:

1. **Location Analysis** - A comprehensive analysis from the Location Story Analyst covering:
   - Identity and narrative soul
   - Physical truth (materials, construction, sensory details)
   - Zones (main minehead, command bench, family vigil grounds, ventilation collars, underground collapse zone, surface yards, support buildings)
   - Temporal states (daily cycle, seasonal, weather)
   - Character-space relationships (Veyra and Grimjaw)
   - Narrative beats (discovery of limits, Grimjaw listening, vigil waiting, breakthrough, dusk operations)
   - Recommended images (establishing, beats, zones, temporal)

2. **Source Files**:
   - overview.md - Basic info, significance, key features
   - description.md - Detailed physical description

Now I need to create a location_imagery.yaml that transforms this analysis into production-ready image specifications.

Let me work through the key elements:

**Visual Anchor:**
- Timber headframe 28-32 ft tall
- Stone-ringed shaft collar 8-10 ft diameter with iron banding
- Fracture flags (painted stakes and cloths)
- Canvas windsocks on ventilation collars
- Dry-laid retaining walls on benched terraces
- Iron strap-rail over hardwood sleepers
- Lantern lines at night
- Bell code plates
- Rope stanchion boundaries at vigil grounds

**Materials:**
- Timber: seasoned oak and mountain fir
- Stone: metamorphic bedrock, dry-laid walls
- Metal: iron straps, dogs, bolts, sheaves, banding
- Canvas: windsocks, windbreaks
- Oil lamps and lanterns


- Palette captures the site's rugged, weathered industrial essence with muted, earthy tones

The color scheme reflects the harsh mining environment, blending natural materials with industrial elements. Oak's deep umber and weathered fir gray dominate the timber structures, while slate-blue stone peaks and lime-gray retaining walls provide geological context. Iron's black and bronze fittings add industrial strength, with tan canvas and argent vein glints creating visual depth. Copper dusk light bathes the scene, emphasizing the site's emotional landscape.

The recommended imagery captures critical narrative moments: the full site during a somber evening rescue, Grimjaw's intimate listening at a vent collar, the desperate family vigil grounds at night, a triumphant underground breakthrough, and the main site's expansive character.

I'll methodically develop the visual narrative, focusing on architectural authenticity and emotional resonance. The imagery will incorporate character-specific details like Veyra's dragon-burn scars and Grimjaw's engineering expertise, ensuring each frame communicates deeper story elements.
