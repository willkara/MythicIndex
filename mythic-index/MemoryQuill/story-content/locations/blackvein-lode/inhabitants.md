- Night: Minimal lift cycles; sentry on vents and weather; quiet zone enforced near collapse headings.

## Notes
- Circulation and safety dictate occupancy: rope lines and barricades maintain separation between family vigil and workfront.
- Stretcher routes, bell-code boards, and vent access are kept clear at all times to preserve emergency response paths.
