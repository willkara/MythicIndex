# Blackvein Lode – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Foothills on the western approaches of the Sword Mountains, on a steep colluvial slope with bedrock outcrops of hard metamorphic stone veined with argentiferous ore. Access via narrow switchback trails cut into talus and weathered scree.
- Site Advantages: Elevated, wind-scoured site reduces stagnant air at the collar; bedrock near-surface allows firm anchorage for headframe and collar works; natural benches afford staging and tailings separation.
- Environmental Factors: Sudden mountain squalls, high winds, freeze–thaw cycles causing rockfall and scree creep; dust conditions severe during dry spells; winter ice complicates footing and equipment haul.
- Approach Routes: Primary pack-trail from the southwest bench to the main minehead; auxiliary spur to ventilation collars for inspection; narrow hand-cut traverse to the command staging area separated from family vigil grounds.

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Functional dwarven-influenced industrial mining works—timber and stone anchored into competent rock; emphasis on structural necessity over ornament; visual order from cribbing patterns and track geometry.
- Primary Materials: Oak and mountain fir timbers (seasoned for cribbing and sets), iron straps, dogs, and bolts; dry-laid stone retaining walls; forged capstans, pulleys, and sheaves; canvas windsocks and leather bellows for ventilation aids.
- Construction Methods: Shaft collar ringed in stone with timber curb and iron banding; timber-headframe braced with diagonal struts; tipple platform on stone piers; underground timber sets with lagging and bearing wedges; vent-raise collars with louver shutters.
- Overall Layout: A clustered surface yard around the main shaft (headframe, hoist/capstan, tipple, lamproom, foreman’s office, tool house), with tailings slopes downhill, ventilator collars upslope on the ridge, and segregated zones for command staging and family vigil. Underground, a multi-level network (Levels 1–3) of drifts, crosscuts, and stopes following the silver-bearing vein.

### Underground Levels (Pre- and Post-Collapse)
- Dimensions & Scale: Level 1 (shallow works), Level 2 (main drift), Level 3 (deep gallery collapse zone); drift clear widths 5–6 ft; set spacing 4–6 ft depending on ground.
- Construction Details: Timber sets (cap–post–sill) with oak wedges to bear; lagging against fractured backs; occasional stone pack-walls at weak ribs; refuge niches cut at intervals; rail tram sets in main drifts.
- Layout Configuration: Main drift follows ore strike with crosscuts to ventilation raises; pump sumps at level toes; bell pull lines and signal plates at junctions.
- Distinctive Features: Silver-bearing vein presents argent sheen within dark host rock; fracture “laddering” visible where Guild team over-cut and under-braced.
- Physical Condition: Post-collapse, deep gallery is barricaded; controlled cribbing and relief cuts installed per master engineer’s plan; air pockets (refuge voids) identified and preserved during breakthrough.

### Family Vigil and Command Staging Areas
- Dimensions & Scale: Vigil grounds ~40x50 ft with fire circles; command bench ~20x30 ft wind-sheltered.
- Construction Details: Rope stanchions, lantern lines, windbreak canvas; message boards and time-slates; triage tent on leveled gravel.
- Layout Configuration: Clear separation between public vigil and workfront; stretcher corridor to infirmary tent; observers held behind rope to limit slope loading and noise near the collar.
- Distinctive Features: “Quiet zone” placard at workfront—sound discipline to read stone and signals.
- Physical Condition: Well-kept post-rescue; rope lines retained as cautionary boundary.

## Physical Systems & Infrastructure

### Structural Engineering
- Foundation Systems: Headframe footings bonded to bedrock with iron dogs; collar ring keyed and banded; retaining walls battered 1:6 with through-stones.
- Load-Bearing Elements: Timber sets and cribbing carry broken ground; bearing wedges preloaded to settle silently; lagging spans scaled backs; stone packs used at ribs with blocky discontinuities.
- Roofing Systems (Underground): Lagging and planking against backs; shotcrete analog not in use—rely on timber and stone; drip gutters carved to drain backs into sumps.
- Connections & Joints: Oak pegs, iron straps, and dogs; scarf joints at headframe diagonals; eye-bolts for hoist tackle.

### Environmental Controls
- Ventilation: Upcast/downcast management via louvered collars, brattices, and air doors; windsocks show flow; bellows supplement during still air; canary/lamps for gas cues where applicable.
- Lighting Systems: Oil lamps and shielded lanterns on brackets; emergency lamp racks in refuge niches; surface lantern lines mark corridors at night.

- Color Palette: Iron black, oak umber, lime-gray stone, argent vein, lantern gold, canvas tan; at dusk, copper shadows across the slope.
- Light & Shadow: Lamp halos carve narrow cones through dust; headframe casts a skeletal lattice on the yard; underground, slit shadows reveal lagging gaps.

### Acoustic Environment
- Sound Reflection: Yard returns sharp tool-clink; underground absorbs into timber and dust; distinct carry of bell codes.
- Noise Sources: Capstan creak, sheave whirr, pump clack, gravel hiss under boots; in still moments, faint stone “talk” and drip from backs.
- Acoustic Zones: Quiet zone at workface; lively clatter near tipple; muffled command bench under canvas.
- Communication: Bell pulls and plates; shouted codes curtailed near collapse; surface signal boards updated on the half-hour.

### Environmental Atmosphere
- Air Quality: Surface air thin and clean; underground stale without flow; acrid collapse dust until wetted and settled.
- Scent Profiles: Oil, resin, hot iron, damp rock, metallic tang of silver-bearing stone; smoke and stew at the vigil fires.
- Physical Comfort: Cold eddies on the bench; warmth at braziers and lamproom; underground humidity chills bone.
- Weather Response: Sudden gusts reverse windsocks; rain searches seams and cuts rills in tailings; frost heaves sleepers on the track.

## Temporal & Seasonal Variations

### Daily Environmental Changes
- Morning: Frost on timbers; windsocks slow; crews chalk fracture flags.
- Midday: Dust peaks; pump crews rotate; canvas snaps on gusts.
- Evening: Lantern lines glow; command bench tallies posted; vigil fires draw families close.
- Night: Minimal hoist cycles; sentries monitor vent flow and stone sounds.

### Seasonal Adaptations
- Spring: Slope softening and rill control; fracture mapping increases; drainage ditches re-cut.
- Summer: Dust management; heat stress protocols; increased ventilation.
- Autumn: Stockpiling timbers; louver maintenance; tailings buttress checks.
- Winter: Ice sanding, rope de-icing, reduced haul; braziers and shelters expanded.

### Weather Response Patterns
- Fair Weather: Continuous ventilation; maximum advance at faces; efficient carting.
- Storms: Suspend heavy lifts; secure headframe tackle; retreat to safe refuge works.
- Extreme Weather: Close vent doors to control drafts; hold in secure headings; post-storm survey required before resumption.
