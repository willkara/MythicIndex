creatures:
  - name: Cobblestone Crab
    description: Crustaceans that have adapted to urban life by developing shells that perfectly mimic cobblestones. They emerge at night to scavenge and clean the streets, returning to stone form by dawn. The ward's mysteriously clean streets are partially their doing.
    visual_aspects:
      - Shells made of actual stone bonded to their bodies
      - Size varies from fist-sized to large serving platter
      - Shells match the exact gray and texture of surrounding cobbles
      - Legs and claws retract completely, leaving perfect stone appearance
      - Eyes on short stalks, last parts to retract
    habitat:
      where: Paved streets and squares throughout Castle Ward
      when: Emerge after dark to scavenge; stone form by first light
      why: Feed on dropped food, waste, and organic debris
    behavior:
      who: Hundreds scattered throughout the ward, territorial about specific blocks
      what: Methodical scavengers that clean streets while feeding
      how: Use powerful claws to break down organic matter
    lore: Castle Ward nobles have no idea the "decorative cobblestones" are alive. Street sweepers know and appreciate them—areas with healthy Crab populations need half the cleaning. One drunk nobleman once tried to pry up a "loose cobblestone" for a souvenir. It bit him. He blamed the wine.

  - name: Statue Pigeon
    description: Pigeons that can transform their bodies to perfect stone, roosting on statues and architecture in plain sight. Unlike normal pigeons, they're fiercely territorial and intelligent, serving as informal guards by dive-bombing thieves and raising alarm calls.
    visual_aspects:
      - Appear as normal pigeons in flight, turn to stone when perched
      - Stone form perfectly matches the material they're roosting on
      - Can hold stone form for days if undisturbed
      - Eyes remain slightly mobile even in stone state
      - Revert to flesh with explosive burst of wing beats
    habitat:
      where: Statues, monuments, and architectural details throughout Castle Ward
      when: Active day and night; stone form during rest periods
      why: Territorial defense and nesting sites on prestigious buildings
    behavior:
      who: Mated pairs claim specific statues or building sections
      what: Guard territories zealously; attack anyone tampering with their roosts
      how: Stone form for camouflage; return to flesh for aerial attacks
    lore: A ring of statue thieves once tried to steal a valuable bronze hawk from a noble's roof. Four Statue Pigeons had claimed it as roosting territory. The thieves were found the next morning, pecked bloody and traumatized, still clinging to their rope. The Watch knows to check for Statue Pigeons before dismissing "statues attacking people" reports.

  - name: Alley Shadow
    description: Two-dimensional entities that exist as living shadows in the narrow spaces between Castle Ward's grand buildings. They're curious rather than hostile, following interesting people and listening to conversations, occasionally manifesting to point out things of interest.
    visual_aspects:
      - Appear as unusually dark, person-shaped shadows
      - Move independently of light sources
      - Can stretch, compress, and flow through any gap
      - Occasionally form simple shapes to communicate—arrows, question marks
      - Eyes visible only as darker voids within shadow
    habitat:
      where: Narrow alleys, building gaps, and shadows between structures
      when: Present constantly; more visible in bright daylight by contrast
      why: Feed on secrets and interesting information; drawn to intrigue
    behavior:
      who: Dozens throughout the ward, possibly more
      what: Observe people, follow interesting conversations, occasionally help or hinder
      how: Travel through shadow spaces; can appear anywhere shadows connect
    lore: Castle Ward has always had excellent informal intelligence networks. Some credit the Alley Shadows—they eavesdrop on everything and occasionally "share" by manifesting near relevant people at opportune moments. One Shadow reportedly led a Watch investigator directly to stolen goods by appearing at every turn until he followed.

  - name: Gargoyle Gecko
    description: Small reptiles that cling to buildings and have evolved to resemble decorative gargoyles and architectural details. They're actually beneficial, eating pests and small vermin, but their appearance causes frequent false alarms about "moving gargoyles."
    visual_aspects:
      - Size of large lizards with exaggerated grotesque features
      - Skin texture mimics carved stone down to weathering and moss
      - Can flare wing-like flaps of skin to enhance gargoyle appearance
      - Gray, brown, or greenish coloring matching different stone types
      - Move in short, jerky motions that look like settling stonework
    habitat:
      where: Building facades, especially near actual gargoyle decorations
      when: Most active dawn and dusk; appear as stone during midday
      why: Hunt insects, small rodents, and urban pests
    behavior:
      who: Territorial individuals claiming specific buildings
      what: Ambush small prey from architectural perches
      how: Perfect stillness then explosive strikes; glide between buildings using skin flaps
    lore: Castle Ward's exterminators love them; architects hate them. A Gecko will clear a building of pests in weeks, but nervous nobles keep reporting "cursed gargoyles coming to life." One prominent lord spent a fortune on mages to "cleanse" his manor. The Geckos just moved to the building next door and his pest problem returned immediately.
