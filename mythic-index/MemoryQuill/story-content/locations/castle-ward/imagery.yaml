    Castle Ward is power made stone—ancient, deliberate, and watchful. It does
    not welcome; it evaluates. Every clean cobblestone and polished facade
    declares that order here is not accident but will. The district tolerates
    visitors but never forgets they are visitors.

  scene_mood: "reverent"
  mood_rationale: |
    Castle Ward demands respect through sheer architectural presence. The mood
    is reverent not because the viewer worships, but because the district was
    built to make viewers feel small and the state feel eternal. There is
    weight here—centuries of governance made visible in stone.

  visual_description: |
    Castle Waterdeep rises on its rocky spur above the noble district, its
    towers catching the last light of afternoon. Below, the Boulevard of the
    Enlightened winds between manor houses and government buildings, their
    white marble facades gleaming against the grey granite foundations. A
    fountain at the central square sends plumes of water catching the light.
    City Watch officers in their distinctive uniforms stand at an intersection,
    while a noble carriage passes on fitted flagstone. The district is
    immaculate—no litter, no peeling paint, no broken lamps. Magical
    streetlights wait unlit, knowing their time will come.

  composition_notes: |
    Wide establishing shot from elevated position (perhaps a rooftop at
    district edge). Castle Waterdeep positioned in upper third, anchoring the
    frame. Boulevard creates leading line from lower frame toward castle.
    Foreground includes rooftop elements for depth. Rule of thirds with castle
    at intersection point.

  narrative_significance: |
    This is where Waterdeep is governed—where the Masked Lords convene, where
    the Open Lord holds court, where the great noble families maintain their
    ancestral seats. To enter Castle Ward is to enter the realm of law,
    tradition, and power. Nothing here is accidental.

    Oil painting, matte finish, visible brushwork. Establishing shot of
    Waterdeep's Castle Ward district, late afternoon. Castle Waterdeep rises on
    rocky spur in upper third of frame, towers catching golden light. Wide
    boulevard of fitted flagstone leads toward castle, flanked by noble manor
    houses and government buildings in white marble and grey granite. Central
    fountain with water plumes catching sunlight. City Watch officers in
    uniform at intersection, noble carriage passing. Magical street lamps
    unlit, waiting for dusk. Blue-grey slate roofs, bronze fixtures, deep blue
    banners with Waterdeep coat of arms. Elevated perspective from district
    edge looking toward castle. Warm golden hour light from right, long
    dramatic shadows. High fantasy medieval city, immaculate and ordered. No
    litter, no decay, no chaos. Subtle fantasy: ward-stones at building
    corners, gentle glow from government building windows, mixed ancestries
    among pedestrians.

    scene_mood: "ethereal"
    mood_rationale: |
      From this height, the city becomes abstract—a tapestry of rooftops and
      streets, smoke and movement. The viewer is removed from the mundane,
      granted perspective that few ever receive. There is something
      otherworldly about seeing so much human activity reduced to pattern.

    visual_description: |
      A broad stone balcony high on Castle Waterdeep, its balustrade carved
      with the city's heraldic devices. The view sweeps across all of Waterdeep
      below—the ordered streets of Castle Ward directly beneath, then the
      bustle of the Trade Ward, the towers of the Sea Ward, the docks and
      harbor glittering in the distance. The balustrade is grey granite,
      worn smooth by centuries of hands resting upon it. Potted evergreen
      shrubs in bronze urns flank the entrance arch. A stone bench sits
      against the inner wall, where petitioners might wait. The sky is vast
      above, clouds moving at this height in ways invisible from the streets.

    composition_notes: |
      Camera positioned at balcony level, looking out over the city. Balustrade
      as strong horizontal element in lower third. City view occupies middle
      and upper portions of frame. Depth emphasized through atmospheric
      perspective—distant areas hazier. One of the potted shrubs provides
      foreground anchor at frame edge.

    narrative_significance: |
      This is where the powerful come to think. The view reminds them what they
      govern—and what they might lose. Private audiences sometimes occur here,

    scene_mood: "clandestine"
    mood_rationale: |
      Committee rooms are where the real work happens—not the theater of the
      full Council, but the quiet negotiations, the deals struck in smaller
      circles. The mood is clandestine not because evil occurs here, but
      because power here is wielded quietly, deliberately, away from public
      spectacle.

    visual_description: |
      A rectangular chamber of modest grandeur, designed for serious work
      rather than ceremony. A long oak table dominates the center, its surface
      marked by decades of documents, inkwells, and elbows. High-backed chairs
      in dark leather line both sides—twelve seats, never quite enough.
      Tall windows along one wall are covered by heavy blue drapes, currently
      drawn to admit slanted afternoon light. Maps of Waterdeep and the Sword
      Coast hang on the opposite wall, some with pins and strings marking
      trade routes or patrol boundaries. A sideboard holds decanters and
      glasses, refreshment for long sessions. The city seal is carved into
      the stone above the single door. Candle sconces wait unlit along the
      walls.

    composition_notes: |
      Medium shot from one end of the table, looking down its length. Table as
      strong horizontal element creating depth. Windows at left, maps at right.
      Single door visible at far end beneath the carved seal. Chairs as
      repeating vertical elements. Empty but clearly used—documents on table,
      glasses half-full.

    narrative_significance: |
      This is where factions negotiate, where compromises are reached, where
      the sausage of governance gets made. Unlike the Council Chambers, there
      is no audience here—only participants. What is said in this room shapes
      the city.

      The Council Chambers are designed to intimidate. The Masked Lords sit in

      space is ominous because power here is absolute and largely anonymous.
      Decisions made in this room can elevate or destroy.

    visual_description: |
      A grand circular chamber beneath a domed ceiling, designed for ceremony
      and judgment. Tiered seating rises in a semicircle—the upper tiers lost
      in shadow where the Masked Lords sit unseen. The lower tier holds seats
      for the unmasked officials and noble observers, their faces visible but
      expressions guarded. At the chamber's nadir, a circular speaking floor
      of polished marble bears the Waterdeep coat of arms inlaid in colored
      stone. A single shaft of light falls from an oculus in the dome, striking
      this floor—whoever stands to speak stands illuminated while judgment
      watches from darkness. The Open Lord's throne sits at the focal point of
      the semicircle, elevated but not highest—first among equals, not
      sovereign. Blue and silver banners hang from pillars, still in the
      chamber's motionless air.

    composition_notes: |
      Wide shot from speaking floor level, looking up at the tiered seating.
      The dome visible above, oculus creating the light shaft. Open Lord's

      Upper tiers deliberately underexposed, suggesting the watching shadows.
      Strong vertical emphasis from pillars and banners.

    narrative_significance: |
      This is the theater of power—where the Masked Lords render judgment,
      where criminals are sentenced, where treaties are ratified. The

      Rooftops are the domain of those who move outside normal channels—

      views this scene is seeing it from a perspective that implies secrecy.

    visual_description: |
      A slate-tiled rooftop in Castle Ward, high enough to see across the
      noble district but not so high as the castle itself. Chimney stacks of
      blackened brick rise at intervals, smoke trailing from working hearths
      below. The tiles are blue-grey slate, some cracked or shifted, with
      copper flashing turned green along the ridgeline. A dormer window
      provides access from within—currently shuttered. Across the roofscape,
      similar rooftops stretch toward Castle Waterdeep, which looms in the
      background. The streets below are invisible from this angle, but the
      sounds of carriage wheels and vendor calls rise as distant murmur. A
      pigeon roost occupies one chimney top, birds coming and going.

    narrative_significance: |
      This is the secret highway of Castle Ward—used by those who prefer not
      to be seen on the streets below. Rooftops connect, and someone who knows

      Oil painting, matte finish, visible brushwork. Rooftop view in medieval
      fantasy noble district, dusk. Blue-grey slate tiles in sharp foreground
      detail, some cracked or shifted. Copper ridgeline flashing with verdigris
      patina. Blackened brick chimney stacks with wisps of smoke. Shuttered
      dormer window at frame edge. Roofscape of similar buildings stretching
      toward castle fortress on rocky spur in background, slightly hazy with
      distance. Low camera angle at crouch height on tiles. Twilight sky, sun
      recently set, cool blue with warm glow from windows below street level.
      Pigeon roost on one chimney, birds settling. First stars appearing.
      Empty of people. Subtle fantasy: ward-stones at building corners glowing
      faintly, castle windows with magical light. Covert vantage point, secret
      highway above the streets.
