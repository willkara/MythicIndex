    Castle Ward is the administrative heart of Waterdeep, a district of
    stone towers, government offices, and noble estates. It observes
    without judging, serving whoever holds power with the same granite
    indifference it has shown for centuries. It does not love its
    inhabitants—it simply endures, outlasting every lord and every law.

  scene_mood: reverent
  mood_rationale: |
    Castle Ward commands respect through architecture alone. The scale and
    permanence of the buildings convey institutional authority that exists
    independent of whoever currently holds power. Visitors are meant to
    feel small and supplicant.

  visual_description: |
    An elevated view of Castle Ward stretching from the viewer toward
    Castle Waterdeep, which crowns Mount Waterdeep in the distance. Wide
    ceremonial avenues lined with granite government buildings and noble
    estates radiate from central plazas. Tall, narrow windows pierce
    uniform facades. Heraldic banners hang from poles at intersections.
    Griffon statues stand sentinel atop corner pillars. The district's
    architecture is vertical and imposing—towers, spires, and high-pitched
    slate roofs reaching toward the sky. A few figures in fine clothes or
    official robes move along the streets, dwarfed by the buildings.

  composition_notes: |
    High-angle establishing shot looking toward Castle Waterdeep. Use the
    castle as the background focal point with the district's buildings
    creating leading lines toward it. Foreground should include one plaza
    or intersection with visible scale figures. Architectural repetition
    creates rhythm; variety comes from heraldic colors and building heights.

  narrative_significance: |
    Castle Ward represents Waterdeep's administrative power—the courts,
    councils, and noble families who shape the city's fate. It stands in
    contrast to the organic chaos of the Dock Ward and the commercial
    bustle of Trade Ward.

    Oil painting, matte finish, visible brushwork. Establishing shot of a
    medieval fantasy government district, Castle Ward of Waterdeep.
    Elevated view looking toward a massive castle on a hill in the
    distance. Wide ceremonial avenues lined with imposing granite
    government buildings and noble estates. Tall, narrow windows in
    uniform stone facades. Heraldic banners in deep blue and purple hang
    from poles at intersections. Griffon statues stand sentinel on corner
    pillars. Slate roofs and copper domes with verdigris patina. A few
    small figures in fine robes walk the streets, dwarfed by architecture.
    Morning light casting sharp shadows. High-angle establishing shot.
    Fantasy medieval civic architecture, not medieval military. Polished,
    formal, institutional. Subtle fantasy: ward-stones at gate corners,
    subtle magical street lamps, mixed ancestries among the figures.

      A balcony of Castle Waterdeep offers a commanding view of the city
      and the sea beyond. The elevation enforces contemplation and a
      sense of responsibility—one sees all that depends on decisions
      made within these walls.

    visual_description: |
      A stone balcony projecting from Castle Waterdeep's outer wall,
      offering a panoramic view of Waterdeep spread below. A low
      balustrade of carved granite with griffon finials marks the edge.
      The harbor is visible in the distance, tiny ships at anchor. The
      city's wards spread in a patchwork of rooftops and streets. The
      balcony floor is polished granite, worn smooth by centuries of
      feet. An arched doorway leads back into the castle's interior,
      dark by comparison. Wind moves a single heraldic banner mounted
      on the balcony's corner.

    composition_notes: |
      Wide-angle shot from within the balcony, using the balustrade as

      to emphasize the height and view.

      Oil painting, matte finish, visible brushwork. Medieval fantasy
      city rooftop in late afternoon golden light. Slate-tiled roof
      of a government building with flat section bounded by low stone
      parapet. Copper chimney stacks with beautiful verdigris patina.
      View extends across neighboring slate and tile rooftops toward
      distant harbor in one direction, mountain with castle in other.
      Small wooden bench tucked against a chimney stack, forgotten
      refuge. Pigeons perched on parapet edge. Weathered slate tiles
      with moss in shadowed corners. Late golden hour light creating
      long soft shadows. Camera at rooftop level. Empty of people.
      Peaceful, contemplative atmosphere. High fantasy medieval civic
      architecture. Waterdeep Castle Ward rooftop. Subtle fantasy:
      distant magical lamplights, unusual chimney smoke colors.
