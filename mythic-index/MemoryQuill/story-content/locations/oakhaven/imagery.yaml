narrative_soul: |
  Oakhaven is a village frozen in plague-time—a place where death has become
  organized, where care persists even in catastrophe. Behind the sharpened
  stake barricade with its skull warning, neat rows of sheet-wrapped bodies
  wait for burning, while windows marked with red X's show candle-glow from
  the infected still living.

  At its heart is the barn hospice where Aldwin Gentleheart performs his
  sacred work—transforming death from defeat into peaceful passage. Here,
  cots arranged with personal effects hold the dying, while lanterns on
  rafters and the bronze brazier's glow create warmth against the gray
  weight of plague.

  This is not a place of horror but of dignity—where death is met with
  care, where mercy is the deepest medicine. The visual language must
  balance the weight of plague with the warmth of compassion, the gray
  of death with the amber of mercy's ritual.

one_line_essence: "A plague village where death is organized with dignity and mercy transforms passage."
