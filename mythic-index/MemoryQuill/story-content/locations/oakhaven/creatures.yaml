creatures:
  - name: Healing Hound
    description: Gentle spectral dogs that watch over the sick in the barn hospice. They don't bark but whine softly to alert healers when patients' conditions change. Their presence comforts the dying and seems to ease pain simply by being near.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent forms of various dog breeds, all gentle-natured
      - Soft golden glow emanating from their bodies
      - Eyes infinitely kind and understanding
      - Movements slow and deliberate to avoid startling patients

      who: Multiple individuals, possibly spirits of village dogs who served healers
      what: Watch over patients, alert healers to changes, provide comfort
      how: Lie beside the ill; whine softly when attention is needed
    lore: Every healer in Oakhaven has been guided by the Hounds. A soft whine means check that patient now—they've caught infections, internal bleeding, and crisis moments before symptoms appeared. Children love them, and dying patients often reach out to pet them in final moments. "The Hounds will guide you home," healers say. It brings comfort.

  - name: Grain Spirit
    description: A gentle presence that inhabits the barn's grain storage. It keeps grain fresh and dry, deters pests, and occasionally manifests as a sweet scent of fresh bread. The hospice has never had grain spoilage or rot, despite the moisture from healing activities.
    visual_aspects:
      - Rarely fully visible; appears as golden shimmer in grain
      - Sometimes manifests as swirling grain patterns that reform perfectly
      - Creates scent of fresh bread and healthy wheat
      - Temperature around grain stays ideal regardless of weather
      - Leaves perfectly arranged grain kernels in geometric patterns
    habitat:
      where: Grain storage area of the converted barn
      when: Constant presence; most active when grain is disturbed
      why: Original barn spirit adapted to new healing purpose
    behavior:
      who: Single ancient entity predating hospice conversion
      what: Preserves grain, maintains optimal storage conditions
      how: Uses subtle magic to control moisture and temperature
    lore: When the barn was converted to a hospice, villagers worried the spirit would leave. Instead, it stayed and adapted. Now it ensures both grain stores and medicinal herb supplies stay fresh. Healers leave offerings of honey and milk in the grain room. The spirit responds by making bread smell waft through the hospice when patients need comfort.

  - name: Oak Watcher
    description: Ancient oak trees around the village that seem to watch over Oakhaven protectively. While not creatures in traditional sense, they're aware and responsive, dropping acorns to mark safe paths and rustling leaves in warning when strangers approach with ill intent.
    visual_aspects:
      - Massive oak trees, some centuries old
      - Bark seems to form face-like patterns when viewed from certain angles
      - Branches move purposefully, not just with wind
      - Acorns drop in specific patterns—almost like signs
      - Roots visible above ground create natural seating and barriers
    habitat:
      where: Throughout and surrounding Oakhaven village
      when: Constant awareness; more responsive during threats
      why: Ancient trees awakened by generations of gratitude and care
    behavior:
      who: Multiple individual trees forming protective network
      what: Watch over village, mark paths, warn of threats
      how: Drop acorns, rustle leaves, shift branches to guide or warn
    lore: Oakhaven's children grow up knowing the trees are watching over them. Lost children follow acorn trails home. Hostile visitors find themselves increasingly uncomfortable as trees rustle warnings. One bandit group approached with bad intentions—every oak erupted in noise, and the entire village was alerted. The bandits fled, convinced the forest itself opposed them.

      - Normal swallows in appearance but with unusually melodious voices
      - Plumage slightly more vibrant than typical swallows
      - Movements synchronized when multiple birds sing together
      - Build nests directly over patient areas
      - Return every year to the same nests
    habitat:

      when: Morning and evening songs; respond to patient distress
      why: Attracted to healing environment; blessed by passage of time
    behavior:
      who: Colony of 20-30 returning annually
      what: Sing pain-easing melodies; time songs to patient needs
      how: Melodies have measurable calming and analgesic effects
    lore: Healers schedule difficult procedures for early morning when the swallows sing—patients report less pain. One elderly woman in constant agony would only smile during the evening songs. When she died peacefully during a sunset serenade, the swallows sang for three hours straight. The village says they were singing her soul home.
