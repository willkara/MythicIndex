  narrative_soul: |
    The Grove is where the wounded go to become whole—not through bandages and 
    stitches, but through the slow work of water, light, and living green. For Vera, 
    ravaged by the violence of forced transformation, this sequestered hollow offers 
    what no city healer could: a place where wildness is not threat but medicine, 
    where the wolf-wound in her spirit can be acknowledged and integrated rather than 
    simply sutured shut. The Grove exists as proof that civilization and nature need 
    not be enemies—that healing happens in the spaces between.
    
  one_line_essence: "Where broken wildness finds its way back to wholeness"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "Healing through integration rather than excision"

      - "Transformation as trauma vs. transformation as gift"
      - "Hidden knowledge vs. official channels"
      - "The slow work of healing vs. the urgency of the mission"

  transformation_arc: |
    The Grove itself remains constant—its function is to be unchanging, a fixed point 
    of natural order against which the wounded can measure their own return to 
    equilibrium. But the Company's relationship to it transforms: what begins as 
    desperation (Vera needs healing they cannot provide) becomes connection (Rill 
    Vossari's water expertise opens intelligence channels) and finally integration 
    (the Grove becomes part of the Company's network, proving their reach extends 
    beyond martial allies into natural wisdom).

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Living architecture—druidic shaping of wood, water, and stone"
  primary_materials:
    - "living oak, ash, willow (trained through druidic shaping)"
    - "fieldstone rings and stepping setts"
    - "spring-fed water (three linked pools)"
    - "woven hazel/willow hurdles"
    - "moss, leaf mold, reed mats"
  scale_impression: "Intimate cathedral—the canopy creates grandeur, but the spaces within feel personal, protective, womb-like"
  
  visual_signature: |
    The oak canopy vault dominates—veteran trees with interwoven limbs creating a 
    living lattice 35-50 feet above, through which green-gold light falls in shifting 
    patterns. Below, three crystalline pools mirror this canopy, their surfaces 
    broken only by the gentle flow between them. Everywhere, the architecture is 
    alive: arches are branch-grafts, walls are hedgerows, and paths wind like deer 
    trails rather than marching like roads.
    
  sound_signature: |
    The city is a distant hush, baffled by foliage and terrain. What fills the space 
    instead: the constant undertone of trickling water between pools, birdsong that 
    peaks at dawn and dusk, the whisper of wind through leaves, and—at the 
    meditation spiral entries—twig-and-seed chimes barely audible, more felt than 
    heard. Voices here naturally soften to match the space.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Damp earth and leaf mold form the base note—the honest smell of healthy soil. 
    Layered above: crushed thyme and mint from the herb beds, willow sap when sun 
    warms the bark, and a mineral freshness rising from the spring vents. Near the 
    pools, the air tastes clean in a way city air never does.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Ground that gives beneath bare feet—moss velvet, path bark springy, stone setts 
    cool and smooth. Air moves gently along the rill channels, carrying humidity 
    from the pools. Benches are living-wood or stone, always cool to first touch 
    but warming. The space asks you to slow down, to feel each step.

  light_character: |
    Dappled and alive—the canopy lattice creates a constantly shifting pattern as 
    wind moves the leaves. Light wells are deliberately maintained through pruning, 
    creating pillars of golden-green illumination that move through the day. At the 
    pools, water-reflection throws dancing light onto the undersides of leaves. 
    At night: moonbeams thread through canopy gaps, and foxfire/glowmoss provide 
    minimal guidance—strictly low-lumen to protect the habitat's rhythms.
    
  weather_influence: |
    The bowl topography and surrounding hedge create shelter—wind is broken, 
    temperature moderated. Morning brings ground mist around pool margins, lifting 
    as sun penetrates the canopy. Storms are heard more than felt; canvas sails 
    deploy under canopy for rain protection. The pools' temperature shifts with 
    season—warmer at surface by midday, spring-cold at depth always.

contextual_place:
  region: "Within Waterdeep's bounds, exact location undisclosed"
  neighborhood_character: "Hidden enclave reached via discreet city lanes—the transition from urban to natural is deliberate, marked by winding paths that discourage casual discovery. The city presses close but cannot intrude."
  
  approach_sequences:
    - name: "The City Lane Approach"
      description: "Through unremarkable city streets, turning down alleys that grow quieter, into lanes where green begins to show at walls, until the path narrows to single-file beneath woven branch-arches. The stone gives way to packed earth, then bark mulch."
      first_impression: "The sense of being led somewhere secret—each turn shedding more of the city until the canopy closes overhead and you realize you've crossed into another world."
      
    - name: "The Ridgeline Descent"
      description: "The main ingress follows the natural ridgeline to minimize erosion, then descends into the hollow. The canopy vault opens below like a green cathedral glimpsed from a balcony."
      first_impression: "Revelation—the hidden scale of the space becomes apparent only as you descend, the oak ring revealing itself as something both vast and intimate."

  spatial_relationship: "The Grove exists in a pocket dimension within the city—geographically close but experientially distant. Its bowl topography and layered screening create complete separation from urban life while maintaining physical proximity. It is Waterdeep's green secret."

    physical_description: |
      Approximately 90-100 feet in diameter, defined by the massive trunks of 
      old-growth oaks whose branches interweave at 35-50 feet to form a living

      stepping setts where traffic concentrates. Root buttresses have been shaped 
      (without harm) to serve as natural seats and steps. Four quarter-points are 
      marked by "green door" arches—grafted branches forming lintelled passages—
      with threshold stones etched in druidic sigils.

      The middle pool, connected to the cleansing pool by a shallow rill crossed

      Four spiral patterns set in quiet clearings, each 15-30 feet in diameter.
