creatures:
  - name: Pool Guardian
    description: Translucent water elementals bound to the three sacred pools. They're gentle healers that guide visitors through the purification ritual, but become fierce protectors if the pools are threatened with contamination. Each pool's guardian has a distinct personality.
    visual_aspects:
      - Vaguely humanoid forms of crystalline clear water
      - Ripples and flows constantly like living fountains
      - Contain floating flower petals and healing herbs within their bodies
      - Eyes appear as deeper pools of blue-green within their forms
      - Movement creates soothing sounds of flowing water
    habitat:
      where: The three pools—cleansing, restoration, and reflection
      when: Constantly present; most interactive during healing rituals
      why: Bound to maintain pool purity and assist in healing
    behavior:
      who: Three distinct individuals, each bonded to their specific pool
      what: Guide healing processes, maintain water quality, defend against pollution
      how: Can shape water into specific forms; create currents and temperature changes
    lore: The Cleansing Guardian is playful and encouraging. The Restoration Guardian is serious and focused. The Reflection Guardian is cryptic and speaks in riddles. All three were gifts from a water deity centuries ago, bound to serve all who come in genuine need.

  - name: Canopy Weaver
    description: Spider-like fey creatures that maintain the living lattice of the oak cathedral canopy. They don't build webs but rather encourage branches to interweave properly, creating the sanctuary's natural roof. They're friends to druids but shy around others.
    visual_aspects:
      - Eight-legged forms about the size of house cats
      - Bodies appear to be made of living wood covered in moss
      - Multiple eyes like dark knots in wood
      - Legs end in gentle tendrils that coax branches into place
      - Move with slow, deliberate grace through the canopy
    habitat:
      where: Upper canopy of the oak cathedral, rarely descending below 20 feet
      when: Most active during growing season; dormant in deep winter
      why: Maintain the sacred canopy structure; prune disease and guide growth
    behavior:
      who: Extended family of 8-12 individuals working collectively
      what: Shape canopy growth; remove parasitic plants; create perfect light filtering
      how: Communicate with trees directly; guide growth over years and decades
    lore: Elder Thornwick says the Weavers remember every person who's been healed beneath their canopy. Sometimes branches arrange themselves to create perfect shade or shelter for returning patients, guided by the Weavers' living memory.

  - name: Silence Moth
    description: Pale nocturnal moths with foxfire-glowing wings that enforce the sanctuary's peace. They steal the voices of those who disrupt meditation or healing rituals, leaving only whispers until the transgressor makes amends. Patient healers value them; the thoughtless fear them.
    visual_aspects:
      - Wingspan of a human hand with translucent pale wings
      - Wings glow with soft foxfire luminescence in darkness
      - Bodies covered in downy white fur that absorbs sound
      - Antennae that shimmer when detecting loud voices
      - Flight is completely silent, like drifting snowflakes
      - Eyes reflect moonlight with an eerie silver sheen
    habitat:
      where: Meditation spirals and reflection pool margins
      when: Active at night; dormant as pale cocoons during daylight
      why: Maintain sacred silence; prevent disruption of healing processes
    behavior:
      who: Colony of 20-30 moths operating in coordinated silence
      what: Circle disruptive visitors; touch lips to steal voices temporarily
      how: Voice theft lasts until transgressor completes a silent vigil or makes offering
    lore: The moths remember every promise whispered at the reflection pool. Break an oath spoken here, and they will find you—even beyond the grove—circling your dreams until you return to make it right. Druids say they were born from a healer's dying wish for peace.

  - name: Rootwhisper
    description: An ancient mycorrhizal consciousness extending beneath the entire grove floor, older than the Oak Cathedral itself. It preserves every healing performed here in its distributed fungal memory. Druids consult it like a living archive, and it occasionally releases golden spores that grant visions of past healings.
    visual_aspects:
      - Vast underground fungal network spanning the grove floor
      - Occasionally visible as pale mushroom fruiting bodies
      - Golden luminescent spores released during consultations
      - Fine white threads visible in soil during excavation
      - Pulses with bioluminescence during deep communion
      - Connected to every tree root in the sanctuary
    habitat:
      where: Grove floor substrate; concentrated beneath herbal gardens
      when: Constantly present; most communicative at dawn and dusk
      why: Preserve healing knowledge; maintain soil health; connect all grove life
    behavior:
      who: Single distributed organism functioning as collective intelligence
      what: Store memories of healings; share knowledge through spore visions
      how: Druids touch fruiting bodies and inhale spores to access memories
    lore: Elder Thornwick says Rootwhisper was here before the first druid ever arrived, already ancient when humans were young. It remembers diseases long forgotten and cures thought lost. Once, when a rare poison baffled healers, it released spores showing them a remedy used three centuries prior.
