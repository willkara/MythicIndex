creatures:
  - name: Pool Guardian
    description: Translucent water elementals bound to the three sacred pools. They're gentle healers that guide visitors through the purification ritual, but become fierce protectors if the pools are threatened with contamination. Each pool's guardian has a distinct personality.
    visual_aspects:
      - Vaguely humanoid forms of crystalline clear water
      - Ripples and flows constantly like living fountains
      - Contain floating flower petals and healing herbs within their bodies
      - Eyes appear as deeper pools of blue-green within their forms
      - Movement creates soothing sounds of flowing water
    habitat:
      where: The three pools—cleansing, restoration, and reflection
      when: Constantly present; most interactive during healing rituals
      why: Bound to maintain pool purity and assist in healing
    behavior:
      who: Three distinct individuals, each bonded to their specific pool
      what: Guide healing processes, maintain water quality, defend against pollution
      how: Can shape water into specific forms; create currents and temperature changes
    lore: The Cleansing Guardian is playful and encouraging. The Restoration Guardian is serious and focused. The Reflection Guardian is cryptic and speaks in riddles. All three were gifts from a water deity centuries ago, bound to serve all who come in genuine need.

  - name: Canopy Weaver
    description: Spider-like fey creatures that maintain the living lattice of the oak cathedral canopy. They don't build webs but rather encourage branches to interweave properly, creating the sanctuary's natural roof. They're friends to druids but shy around others.
    visual_aspects:
      - Eight-legged forms about the size of house cats
      - Bodies appear to be made of living wood covered in moss
      - Multiple eyes like dark knots in wood
      - Legs end in gentle tendrils that coax branches into place
      - Move with slow, deliberate grace through the canopy
    habitat:
      where: Upper canopy of the oak cathedral, rarely descending below 20 feet
      when: Most active during growing season; dormant in deep winter
      why: Maintain the sacred canopy structure; prune disease and guide growth
    behavior:
      who: Extended family of 8-12 individuals working collectively
      what: Shape canopy growth; remove parasitic plants; create perfect light filtering
      how: Communicate with trees directly; guide growth over years and decades
    lore: Elder Thornwick says the Weavers remember every person who's been healed beneath their canopy. Sometimes branches arrange themselves to create perfect shade or shelter for returning patients, guided by the Weavers' living memory.
