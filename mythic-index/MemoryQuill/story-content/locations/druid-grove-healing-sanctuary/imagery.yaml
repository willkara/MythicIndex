# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Emotional Core
# ============================================================================
narrative_soul: |
  This is where the wild wounds come to mend—not through medicine but through
  patience, water, and the slow work of living things. The Druid Grove Healing
  Sanctuary exists in the spaces between breaths: the pause after pain, the
  moment before memory surfaces, the stillness where transformation trauma
  finally loosens its grip. Here, veteran oaks have witnessed centuries of
  suffering transmuted into understanding. The three linked pools don't just
  cleanse—they remember, restore, and reveal.

  For Vera, these waters became a mirror she couldn't flee. The dire wolf
  that lives inside her met its own reflection in the scry pool and found,
  instead of a monster, a wounded guardian. Rill Vossari reads the grove's
  waters like letters, pulling intelligence from streams that flow through
  the city's veins, turning hydrology into prophecy.

  The sanctuary's power lies in what it doesn't do: it doesn't fix, force,
  or cure. It holds space. The canopy vault filters everything into green
  stillness. The meditation spirals slow time itself. The pools accept
  whatever enters them—blood, tears, rage—and return only clarity.
