# Undershade Canyon – Overview

## First Appearance
- Chapter: ch01 – “Ash and Compass” [FIRM ch1]

## Quick Description
A deep ochre-banded canyon cut with darker igneous ribs, its south descent glazed in places by old fire. Vines strangle a pair of draconic threshold pillars that open into a vaulted stone nave lined with brass braziers and a basalt plinth. After the Incident, rippled translucent glass planes, crazed edges, and ash-talused overhangs transform the complex into a hazardous labyrinth of light and echo. [FIRM]

## Visual Summary
- Geography: Ochre sedimentary walls with shale caprock at the rim; evening updrafts carrying dry heat and sage/brimstone notes. [FIRM]
- Approach: Steep south switchbacks with vitrified slip patches; alternative fissured gallery to a high escarpment overwatching the nave. [FIRM]
- Threshold: Paired pillars carved with coiled dragons beneath root-torn lintel fragments; ceremonial pinch amplifying chant ingress. [FIRM]
- Nave: Multi-bay vault, rhythmic brass braziers, central basalt plinth with runic floor grooves and circumferential collection ring; trapped chokepoint arch. [FIRM]
- Exterior Ritual Circle: Canyon-floor runic stelae, incised channels and spiral intake geometry that once fed a green‑white heat lattice and serpent construct. [FIRM]
- Post‑Event Layer: Vitrified floors and ribs, lensing glass planes with trapped bubbles, localized spall and frit-fall talus, spiderweb fracture at Borin’s breach. [FIRM]
- Notable Signatures: Perfect scorch circle where Ignis vanished; copper‑ozone scent and a “ripple lens” in adjacent glass. [FIRM]

## Functional Notes
- Chokepoints and Routes: Threshold pillars → brazier lattice line → trapped arch → load‑pillar heat‑shadow corridor → glass breach egress; belay points on rim; stretcher route via fissured gallery. [FIRM]
- Environmental Behavior: Strong twilight updrafts, compressive glass “ping” at night cooling, dawn as safest operating window; freeze‑thaw increases crazing in winter. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Hazards: Vitrified slip surfaces, razor‑crazed glass edges, ash dust irritation, falling glaze flakes from overhangs; “no spark” protocol inside glassed nave. [FIRM]

## Canon Anchors
- [FIRM] ch01 – Rim approach with glazed switchbacks, draconic threshold pillars, vaulted nave with braziers and basalt plinth, exterior ritual circle, lattice ignition and serpent construct, keystone collapse, Borin breach, and Ignis vanishing locus.
