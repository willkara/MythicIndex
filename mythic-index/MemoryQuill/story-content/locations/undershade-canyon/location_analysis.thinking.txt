This is a fascinating location analysis request for Undershade Canyon - a significant location that appears to be the site of a catastrophic event involving dragon-fire magic that transforms stone into glass. Let me work through this systematically.

## Key Understanding from the Files

**The Core Narrative:** This is where a traumatic incident occurred - a cult ritual involving dragon-fire that went catastrophically wrong (or was stopped at great cost). The place has three temporal states:
1. Before: Ancient ritual complex
2. During: Catastrophic transformation event
3. After: Glassed tomb/memorial site

**Character Implications (from Chapter 1 reference):**
- Borin - attempted to breach the glass, his hammer strikes created the spider-web fracture
- Ignis - vanished in a perfect scorch circle (likely died/was consumed)
- Lysander - his shield was used in three-day excavation
- An "acting captain" - deliberately collapsed a keystone to seal the dragon-fire at the cost of their life

This is clearly the inciting incident of the story - Chapter 1 "Ash and Compass" is titled meaningfully.

**Physical Layers:**
1. Geological: Ochre sedimentary canyon with igneous ribs
2. Ancient: Temple complex with dragon-carved pillars, brass braziers, basalt plinth
3. Ritual: Runic floor grooves, exterior circle with stelae
4. Catastrophic: Vitrified glass transformation
5. Memorial: Cairns, names carved in blood, memorial wall

**Zones to Map:**
- Rim stations (threshold/perimeter)
- South switchbacks (perimeter/approach)
- Fissured gallery/high escarpment (perimeter/overwatch)
- Threshold pillars (threshold - the draconic gate)
- Vaulted nave with braziers and plinth (heart - ritual center)
- Trapped arch (threshold/hazard)
- Heat-shadow corridor/antechamber (liminal - now sealed)


- Exterior ritual circle (heart - secondary power center)
- Glassed labyrinth (transformed zones - tomb)
- Ignis vanishing locus (sanctuary/memorial - sacred wound)
- Memorial wall and cairns (sanctuary - memorial)

I see a profound landscape of crystallized trauma. The canyon transforms from a ritual space to a memorial, where stone becomes glass - capturing the moment of ultimate sacrifice. Each zone represents a stage of transformation: from active ritual to frozen memory, where loss is permanently etched into the landscape's very substance.

The emotional resonance is devastating. Survivors are trapped witnessing their companions' final moments, preserved in a glass tomb that speaks of heroism and helplessness. This is not just a physical location, but a testament to human vulnerability and extraordinary courage.

The glass allows vision but prevents passage, creating an unbearable tension between seeing and experiencing. It's a memorial that doesn't just commemorate death, but forces witnesses to confront the precise instant of loss.

The visual narrative reveals a haunting progression through transformed landscapes, capturing moments of profound tragedy. Key scenes expose the raw emotional geography: from vine-strangled pillars marking a threshold to blood-stained fractures that speak of desperate struggle. The memorial space becomes a lens of remembrance, where past and present collide in a scorched, crystalline moment.
