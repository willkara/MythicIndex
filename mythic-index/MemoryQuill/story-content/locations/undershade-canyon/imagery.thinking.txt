This is a request to create location imagery specifications for Undershade Canyon, a dramatic wilderness location that serves as the site of a catastrophic event in the story. Let me analyze the input carefully.

## Key Elements from the Analysis

### Narrative Soul
- Where heroes became legends and companions became ghosts behind glass
- The wound that opened the story
- An ancient ritual site transformed by catastrophic dragon-fire into a crystalline tomb
- Glass that preserves the exact moment of sacrifice - making survivors into witnesses

### Visual Signatures
1. **Ochre Bands** - sedimentary layers spanning millennia, cut by darker igneous ribs
2. **Dragon Pillars** - vine-strangled threshold markers with coiled dragon carvings
3. **The Glass** - rippled translucent walls that were stone, frozen mid-flow with trapped bubbles

### Key Zones
1. **Rim Stations** - perimeter, staging ledges
2. **South Switchbacks** - threshold, treacherous descent
3. **Dragon Threshold Pillars** - threshold, gateway to sacred/profane
4. **Vaulted Nave** - heart, central ritual space (before and after transformation)
5. **Trapped Arch** - threshold, chokepoint
6. **Heat-Shadow Corridor** - liminal, collapsed sacrifice site
7. **Exterior Ritual Circle** - forge, the engine of catastrophe
8. **Fissured Gallery** - perimeter, overwatch position
9. **Borin's Breach** - threshold, where Borin hammered the glass
10. **Ignis Locus** - sanctuary, the perfect scorch circle
11. **Memorial Cairns** - sanctuary, where grief becomes ritual

### Temporal States
- BEFORE: Ancient ritual complex, cult-active
- DURING: The Incident - catastrophic transformation
- AFTER: Memorial site, glassed labyrinth

### Recommended Images from Analysis
1. Establishing - canyon post-Incident with ochre walls and glassed depths (PRIMARY)


2. Zone - Dragon threshold pillars with vine-strangled markers and coiled dragon carvings
3. Zone - Vitrified nave, a crystalline heart transformed by catastrophic energy
4. Beat - Serpent construct emerging in ethereal green-white luminescence
5. Beat - Borin's desperate hammering against the glass, marking his futile resistance
6. Zone - Ignis locus, the perfectly scorched ritual sanctuary
7. Zone - Memorial cairns where collective grief solidifies into ritual remembrance
8. Temporal - Canyon at evening, shadows lengthening across glassed surfaces
9. Perspective - Fractured view through translucent glass walls, bubbles frozen in time
10. Beat - Keystone sacrifice moment, suspended in crystalline preservation
11. Zone - Exterior ritual circle, the forge of catastrophic transformation

Borin's blood stains the glass, marking his violent encounter. Ignis defines the vanishing point of ritual space through a perfect scorch circle. The Acting Captain moves through a heat-shadowed corridor, preparing for the keystone sacrifice.

The visual landscape emerges through signature textures: ochre sedimentary walls with dark igneous veins, shale-capped rims, and vitrified glass surfaces capturing the moment of transformation. Materials blend - sedimentary stone, basalt intrusions, brass braziers - creating a complex archaeological memory of violent transition.

Color anchors emerge in rust-ochre bands and obsidian-black basalt, suggesting the violent geological and ritualistic processes at work.

Brass and gold braziers illuminate translucent glass surfaces, trapping amber and grey bubbles. Ghostly green-white fire memories shimmer, while copper glints mark the Ignis locus. Light becomes a narrative element - canyon ochre walls blazing at evening, interior light fracturing through glass fissures, night revealing copper hints in dim illumination.

The scene demands a wide establishing view capturing geological drama and glass-induced wrongness, centered on evening light dramatizing ochre walls with a somber, weighted mood.

Dragon threshold pillars emerge as a liminal gateway between mundane and sacred realms. Carved coiled dragons intertwine with moss-claimed capitals and root-torn lintels, morning light filtering through the gorge creating an ominous atmosphere hinting at ancient slumbering forces.

The vitrified nave represents the catastrophe's frozen heart - morning light piercing glass fissures, revealing a beautiful horror of rippled walls, fused braziers, and basalt plinth with shapes eternally preserved within trapped bubbles.

A green-white serpent construct builds toward the incident's kinetic visual climax, suggesting transformative energy at the moment of profound change. Somber memorial site with stone cairns marked by blood-pigment names, personal offerings scattered, revealing a vast canyon landscape beyond.

Grief-stricken evening canyon view, molten brass light washing ochre terrain, updrafts creating ethereal movement, glass surfaces capturing sunset's intense colors.

Interior scene through distorted glass barrier, morning light revealing trapped bubbles and obscured shapes, embodying the painful limitation of seeing without accessing.

Intense moment of sacrificial choice, the acting captain's deliberate final act unfolding with kinetic urgency and profound purpose.

Shield wedged dramatically, hands straining toward the keystone, fire's glow illuminating the falling stone's trajectory.

Ritualistic exterior space defined by mathematical precision, morning light revealing runic stelae, incised geometric channels, and haunting scorch marks that suggest a profound, ominous transformation.

For wilderness scenes, I'll capture geological drama through scale, natural processes, and the unsettling narrative of magical metamorphosis, positioning human presence against overwhelming environmental forces.

Aspect ratios strategically chosen: 21:9 for epic landscapes, 16:9 for zone imagery, 3:2 for intimate narrative perspectives.
