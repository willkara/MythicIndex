creatures:
  - name: Emberscale Basilisk
    description: A low-slung reptilian predator that thrives in the residual heat pockets of the canyon. Its scales shimmer with internal heat, creating a mirage-like distortion around its body. The basilisk's eyes glow like dying coals, and it can exhale superheated air that softens glass and stone.
    visual_aspects:
      - Obsidian-black scales with veins of molten orange that pulse with body heat
      - Six legs ending in talons that can grip vitrified surfaces
      - Ridge of crystalline spines along its back formed from consuming glass
      - Length of 8-12 feet, low to the ground
      - Eyes that leave heat trails in cold air
    habitat:
      where: Deep within the canyon's heat pockets, especially near old brazier sites
      when: Most active during dawn and dusk when thermal currents are strongest
      why: Feeds on heat-adapted insects and small mammals; requires high temperatures to digest
    behavior:
      who: Solitary hunters, highly territorial
      what: Ambush predator that uses heat shimmer as camouflage
      how: Softens prey's defenses with breath attack, then strikes with venomous bite
    lore: Local miners believe these creatures were ordinary lizards transformed by the Incident's magical fire. Their crystalline spines are prized by alchemists for fire-resistance potions.

  - name: Glass Weaver
    description: Translucent arachnid-like creatures that emerged after the vitrification event. They spin webs of spun glass fibers so fine they're nearly invisible until light catches them at the right angle. Their bodies refract light, making them appear to flicker in and out of existence.
    visual_aspects:
      - Body segments of clear glass with rainbow iridescence
      - Eight jointed legs ending in hook-shaped spinnerets
      - Size ranging from hand-sized to large dog
      - Internal organs visible as colored fluids flowing through transparent body
      - Create hanging gardens of glass strand sculptures
    habitat:
      where: Vitrified areas with vertical glass planes and crazed surfaces
      when: Active in sunlight when they can camouflage best
      why: Feed on trapped insects and absorb minerals from the glass itself
    behavior:
      who: Live in small colonies of 3-7 individuals
      what: Construct elaborate glass-strand territories that serve as traps and homes
      how: Vibrations in their webs alert them to prey; can inject digestive enzymes
    lore: Their glass strands are stronger than steel wire. Trappers who survive encounters sell the strands to instrument makers and jewelers for incredible prices.

  - name: Ashfall Raven
    description: Corvids adapted to the ash-heavy air of the canyon. Their feathers have developed a waxy coating that sheds fine ash, and they've evolved specialized membranes over their eyes. They're known for their haunting calls that echo through the canyon walls.
    visual_aspects:
      - Jet-black feathers with ash-gray edges
      - Larger than common ravens, wingspan of 5-6 feet
      - Nictitating membranes give eyes a ghostly white appearance
      - Talons stained permanently red-brown from volcanic minerals
      - Often seen with ash particles swirling in their wake
    habitat:
      where: Canyon rim and upper ledges, nesting in protected overhangs
      when: Most vocal at twilight when updrafts are strongest
      why: Scavenge from the canyon floor and hunt small heat-adapted creatures
    behavior:
      who: Highly intelligent, form permanent pair bonds
      what: Use tools to access food, cache shiny objects in nests
      how: Work in pairs to herd prey toward vitrified drop-offs
    lore: Canyon workers consider them omens—their calls warned some miners before the collapse. They're said to remember faces and hold grudges for years.

  - name: Cinder Serpent
    description: Burrowing serpents that tunnel through ash talus and loose scree. They generate mild heat through an unknown biological process, leaving warm trails through the ash. Their scales are heat-resistant and can withstand direct contact with hot surfaces.
    visual_aspects:
      - Segmented bodies covered in overlapping copper-colored scales
      - Blunt, shovel-shaped heads for burrowing
      - Length of 3-5 feet, thickness of a human arm
      - Scales shimmer and create heat distortion
      - Leave distinctive S-shaped warm trails in ash
    habitat:
      where: Ash talus slopes and areas with loose debris
      when: Most active after sunset when they hunt by heat signature
      why: Prey on burrowing insects and underground nests
    behavior:
      who: Solitary except during brief mating season
      what: Create complex tunnel networks that can destabilize ash slopes
      how: Track prey by sensing vibrations and heat signatures through the ground
    lore: Miners claim cinder serpents can sense unstable ground and avoid areas about to collapse. Some rescue teams have learned to follow their trails when searching for safe paths.
