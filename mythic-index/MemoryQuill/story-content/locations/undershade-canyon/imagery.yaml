narrative_soul: |
  Undershade Canyon is the genesis wound, the place where hope became ash and
  grief became purpose. What was ancient stone sanctuary became catastrophic
  crucible became crystalline tomb became sacred ground. The canyon exists in
  three temporal states that coexist in memory and image: the ochre-banded
  throat exhaling primordial heat where vine-strangled dragon pillars mark
  passage to vaulted ritual space; the catastrophic transformation when
  dragon-fire turned architecture to molten glass and sealed the living behind
  barriers transparent yet absolute; and the aftermath where lantern light
  persists not as comfort but as defiance, where a woman's three-day vigil
  carved names in blood and forged loss into vow. Every surface here witnesses
  something—geological time in ochre bands, ancient ambition in basalt plinth
  and brass braziers, recent violence in week-old scorch marks, catastrophic
  transformation in rippled glass that holds shadows frozen, and human
  persistence in cairns built by battered shield. This is threshold, crucible,
  tomb, and birthplace—the Last Light Company drew first breath here, purchased
  by sacrifice measured in blood and broken stone.

one_line_essence: "Where dragon-fire turned stone to glass and grief became vow—the crucible where the Last Light Company was born."
