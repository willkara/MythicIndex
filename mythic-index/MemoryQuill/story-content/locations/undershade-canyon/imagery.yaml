    Where stone became glass and heroes became ghosts behind crystal. This ancient ritual
    site was transformed by catastrophic dragon-fire into a crystalline tomb that preserves
    the exact moment of sacrifice—making survivors into permanent witnesses who can see
    their fallen comrades but never reach them. The glass doesn't just seal the dead;
    it displays them. Every vitrified surface is a window into loss, every frozen ripple
    a reminder that stone can become transparent but grief only hardens.

  mood_rationale: |
    The canyon must feel like a wound—beautiful in its geological drama but
    wrong where the glass begins. Somber captures the weight of what happened
    here without tipping into pure horror. This is a place of grief, not just danger.
  visual_description: |
    A vast geological throat descending through ochre-banded sedimentary walls,
    the strata spanning millennia visible as horizontal bands of rust and amber
    cut by darker igneous ribs of basalt thrusting through at angles. Shale caprock
    at the rim catches the last evening light like hammered copper. The south wall
    shows the treacherous switchback descent, patches of old vitrification glinting
    treacherously where ancient fires glazed the stone.

    But in the depths—wrongness. Where there should be more natural stone, surfaces
    shine too smoothly, too translucent. The glass begins gradually then consumes
    whole sections: rippled planes that were walls, frozen mid-flow. The transformation
    boundary is visible—a line where the canyon stopped being merely ancient and became
    something else entirely.

    Tiny figures at the rim—barely visible—provide scale that makes the geological
    and magical forces feel overwhelming. This is a place where humans are insignificant
    against the powers that shaped it.
  composition_notes: |
    Wide vertical composition emphasizing the descent from rim to depths. The eye
    should travel down through geological layers (natural) toward the glass (unnatural).
    The rim occupies the top third with sky and caprock silhouette. The middle third
    shows the switchback descent and natural stone. The bottom third reveals the
    glassed depths where the transformation occurred. Evening light enters from
    screen left, casting long shadows that emphasize the vertical relief.
  narrative_significance: |
    This is the first impression of the place where the story's foundational trauma
    occurred. The reader must understand immediately that this is both a geological
    wonder and a site of supernatural catastrophe. The beauty makes the wrongness
    worse—this should have been just a canyon, just stone, just time made visible
    in sedimentary bands. Instead, it became a tomb.
  symbolic_elements: |
    The vertical descent mirrors the narrative descent into the past. The geological
    layers represent accumulated time (the canyon's natural history) while the glass
    represents a single catastrophic moment that froze everything. The transformation
    boundary is the literal line between before and after—between what the canyon was
    and what it became, between who the Company was and who they must now be.

      This narrow space beyond the load-bearing pillar became a death trap when
      the keystone collapsed. The antechamber holds the weight of final moments—
      where the team was sealed and where some drew their last breaths.
    visual_description: |
      A cramped passage beyond the collapsed archway, its walls now fused glass
      and tumbled stone. The ceiling sags where heat weakened ancient supports.
      Rubble chokes the far end where the keystone brought down tons of masonry.

      The air here is still and close, carrying the memory of smoke and panic.
      Glass surfaces preserve distorted reflections—shadows of those who were
      trapped here, frozen in translucent amber. A gap in the debris shows where
      desperate hands tried to claw through.
    composition_notes: |

    narrative_significance: |
      This is where Elara and Borin made their final stand, where Ignis cast

      This is where Borin Stonehand broke himself against the glass trying to
      free his companions. The spiderweb fractures and blood staining make this
      a shrine to desperate love and futile heroism.
    visual_description: |
      A section of the glass barrier bearing the unmistakable marks of violence—
      spiderweb fractures radiating from impact points where Borin's hammer struck
      again and again. Dried blood stains the edges of the gap he managed to create,
      too narrow for rescue, wide enough only for reaching hands.

      Glass chips litter the floor like broken prayers. The fracture pattern tells
      the story of mounting desperation—each strike harder than the last, the final
      blows leaving bloody handprints on the crystalline surface.
    composition_notes: |
      Close-up focus on the fractured glass panel with the gap at center frame.
      The blood staining should be visible but not gratuitous. The fracture pattern
      radiates outward like frozen lightning. Through the gap, hint at the space
      beyond where bodies lay.
    narrative_significance: |
      Borin broke his hands trying to save Elara. This gap represents the terrible
      mathematics of sacrifice—all his divine strength could open only a passage
      too small to matter. Yet he kept striking.
    symbolic_elements: |
      The spiderweb fractures represent faith shattering against immovable reality.
      The blood on glass represents the cost of love. The too-small gap represents
      the cruelty of almost—of being so close yet impossibly far.

      The cairns represent the only physical markers for those lost in the canyon.
      Built by survivors over three days of desperate recovery, each stone was
      placed with love and grief in equal measure.
    visual_description: |
      A gathering of stone cairns in a cleared area near the transept, each pile
      carefully constructed from canyon stone. Names have been carved into the
      largest rocks—some in Common, some in Dwarvish, one in the flowing script
      of the elves. Offerings rest at their bases: a silver-braided holy symbol,
      a scorched feather, a shield boss.

      The glass walls here are less distorted, creating windows that look into
      the sealed chambers beyond. Those who visit can see where the dead rest
      even if they cannot reach them.
    composition_notes: |
      Medium-wide shot showing multiple cairns in relation to the glass walls.

      Built during the three-day recovery operation, these cairns represent the
      transition from rescue to remembrance. They mark the moment when hope
      finally died and grief began its longer work.
    symbolic_elements: |
      Stone piled on stone represents accumulated grief. The carved names represent

    visual_description: |
      A narrow ledge running along the outer wall of the fissured gallery, rising
      to a high escarpment that overlooks the entire vaulted nave below. The view
      is commanding but exposed—anyone standing here can see the brazier rows,
      the basalt plinth, the now-glassed floors stretching out below.

      Broken roof-stones let shafts of light angle down into the depths. The ledge
      itself shows signs of recent use—scrape marks from boots, ash disturbed by
      movement, a dropped arrow still lodged in a crack.
    composition_notes: |
      Wide shot from the ledge looking down into the nave. The viewer should feel

      dark. Thermal updrafts carry the scent of sage and something acrid—the memory
      of fire that will never quite fade.

      pad the grip where blood soaked through. Stone and glass debris have been
      moved, creating a narrow passage toward the sealed chamber.

      Three days of work have left their mark—handprints in ash, knee-worn spots
      in the dust, the careful piling of debris that speaks of methodical determination

      The ritual circle on the canyon floor fed the dragon-fire serpent with
      stolen power. Even now, the runes carry residual energy and an air of
      malevolent purpose.
    visual_description: |
      A complex pattern of runic stelae and incised channels carved into the
      canyon floor, arranged in spiral intake geometry that once fed power to
      the temple above. The channels slope toward a circumferential ring,
      designed to collect and direct energy.

      Scorch marks blacken the stone where runes blazed core-hot during the
      ritual. Mineral residues glint in certain light—metal salts that enhanced
      heat conduction. The air above the circle feels wrong, heavy with potential
      energy that hasn't fully dissipated.
    composition_notes: |
      Overhead or high-angle shot showing the spiral pattern of the ritual circle.

      The circle's geometry allowed them to draw on the life force of their own
      dead when arrows felled chanters—the ritual feeding on death.
    symbolic_elements: |
      The spiral represents power drawn inward. The scorch marks represent the

      captures the moment when Veyra's light refused to die—the symbol that
      would become the Company's identity.
    visual_description: |
      A battered lantern held in a scorched hand, its panes clouded by long miles
      yet somehow still casting a pale gold halo. The flame within burns steady
      despite the oppressive darkness around it. The hand that holds it shows
      fresh burns, the skin blistered but the grip firm.

      Behind the lantern, glass walls reflect and multiply the light into a
      constellation of small defiances. The darkness presses in from all sides,
      but cannot quite reach the center.

      Veyra's lantern became the symbol of Last Light Company—the light that
      stayed when everything else was consumed. This moment represents the birth
      of that identity, when grief became purpose.

      path less obvious but more revealing.
    visual_description: |
      A narrow corridor carved by ancient water through the outer wall of the
      complex, rising at a steep angle toward the escarpment above. Broken
      roof-stones create irregular gaps that let shafts of light penetrate.
      The footing is treacherous—ankle-trap fissures and loose scree.

      Chalk marks on the walls indicate the return path. Glaze flakes from
      overhead overhangs litter the floor, warning of hazards above. The
      corridor opens onto a ledge with a commanding view of the nave below.

      View up the rising corridor toward the light at the top. The narrowness

      This is the path Veyra took to reach the overwatch position. It represents
      her role as scout—finding the way others cannot see, moving where others
      cannot follow.

      The glass barrier is the cruelest element of the transformation—it lets
      you see what you cannot reach. Veyra watched her friends die through
      glass that showed everything and permitted nothing.
    visual_description: |
      A wall of rippled translucent glass where stone should be, its surface
      frozen mid-flow like a vertical wave that never broke. Trapped bubbles
      and flow striae create strange optical effects—distortion and false
      depths that confuse the eye.

      Through the glass, shapes are visible: the outlines of the antechamber,
      the suggestion of fallen stone, the dark forms that might be bodies
      or might be shadow. The barrier reflects lantern light unpredictably,
      sometimes showing the viewer's own face superimposed on the horrors beyond.
    composition_notes: |
      Direct view of the glass barrier, showing both its surface detail and
      what lies beyond. The viewer should feel the horror of seeing without
      being able to act. Reflections and the view through should compete for
      attention.
    narrative_significance: |
      This barrier made Veyra a witness to her team's death. She pounded against
      it, pressed her palms to it, watched through it as hope died. It is the
      physical manifestation of helplessness.
    symbolic_elements: |

    visual_description: |
      The transformation boundary made visible: where natural ochre stone gives
      way to rippled translucent glass, the change frozen mid-process. Tendrils
      of vitrification reach into unaffected stone like frozen lightning.
      The glass surface shows flow patterns as if liquid stone was caught in
      the instant of movement.

      Light behaves strangely at this boundary—natural on one side, multiplied
      and distorted on the other. The contrast makes the impossibility concrete:
      this should not exist, yet here it is.

      A perfect circle of scorched floor, the stone melted to glass in a precise
      radius. Unlike the chaos of the transformation elsewhere, this circle is

      ripple pattern, as if something immensely hot passed through it.

      No body, no ash, no remains. Just the circle and the lingering scent of
      copper and ozone. In dim light, intermittent copper glints appear like

      Lysander's choice to bring down the keystone represents the defining
      moment of heroic sacrifice—one life given to save many, with full
      knowledge of what it would cost.
    visual_description: |
      The moment frozen in aftermath: a collapsed archway where a keystone was
      deliberately struck upward, bringing down tons of stone. The gap that once
      existed—where the team escaped—is now sealed forever. Cherry-red heat
      discoloration marks where a shield was pressed against molten stone.

      Beyond the collapse, dragon-fire still glows through cracks—the sealed
      fury that Lysander died to contain. The violence of the structural failure
      is evident in the scattered masonry and the dust still settling.

      This is where Lysander died. Not in battle with an enemy, but holding

      command—LIVE!—echoes in the silence.

    visual_description: |
      A section of wall near the transept where names have been carved into
      stone—not with tools, but with something sharper. Blood stained the
      inscriptions when they were made. The names are legible but rough,
      carved by hands that shook with grief.

      Cairns cluster nearby, each one representing someone lost. Small offerings
      rest at their bases: a silver-braided symbol of Berronar, a charred feather,
      a folded letter sealed with wax. The glass walls here create windows to
      the sealed chambers, so mourners can see where the bodies rest.

      These names were carved by Veyra during or after the three-day vigil.
      They represent her refusal to let the dead be forgotten, her insistence

      removed from the warped shield and placed with honor.

    visual_description: |
      Figures descending single-file along the south switchbacks, the day's
      last gleam pooling like molten brass on the rim above them. One figure
      holds a lantern that casts a pale gold halo against the oncoming dusk.

      The canyon coils below in ochre bands, exhaling heat that doesn't belong
      to early autumn. Thread-thin chanting rises from the depths—the ancient
      tongue of dragons, barely audible but wrong.
    composition_notes: |
      View from above/behind the descending party, showing the switchbacks

      a death trap.

      A figure kneeling at the canyon's edge, one boot braced against sun-warm

      The canyon coils below in ochre bands cut by darker igneous ribs.
      Heat that doesn't belong to autumn rises on thermal updrafts.

      The shale caprock catches molten-brass evening light, creating a rim of
      gold against the gathering dark below. The view extends down into depths
      where surfaces shine wrong—too smooth, too translucent.
    composition_notes: |
      Viewer at rim level, looking down into the canyon with a figure in

      circumferential collection ring encircles it. The ember-amber orb
      rests (or rested) at its apex, pulsing with inner fire.

      The floor around the plinth shows the worst of the vitrification—
      where the dragon-fire concentrated, the glass is thickest and most
      distorted. Brass brazier rows line the path of approach.
    composition_notes: |
      Central focus on the plinth with braziers visible in periphery. The
      runic grooves should be clearly defined. The orb (if shown) should
      pulse with inner light. The vitrified floor should show concentric
      patterns.
    narrative_significance: |
      This is where Ignis first touched the heirloom orb and triggered the
      ritual's awakening. The plinth represents the lure that drew the team
      into the trap.
    symbolic_elements: |
      The plinth represents the altar of sacrifice. The drainage grooves
      represent power designed to flow in one direction. The orb represents
      the bait that concealed the trap.

    visual_description: |
      A serpentine silhouette of emerald and white flame coiling through
      the nave, its scales knitting from pure fire. The heat-veil convulses
      as it moves, warping the air like ripples in molten glass. Green-white
      tongues of flame leap and return, forming the lattice that trapped
      the team.

      Where it passes, stone begins to flow. Architecture sags under
      impossible heat. The serpent's maw opens to vomit cones of white
      fire that shear through ancient stone.
    composition_notes: |
      Dynamic composition showing the serpent coiling through the nave.
      The scale should be overwhelming—dwarfing human figures. The heat
      distortion should make everything behind it waver. The destruction
      in its wake should be visible.

    visual_description: |
      Steep hairpin turns cutting down the south canyon wall, the path
      switching back and forth across treacherous terrain. Patches of old
      vitrification glint where ancient fire glazed the stone—a thin glass
      skin over friable scree that crumbles under point loads.

      Belay points mark where safety lines should anchor. The path is
      barely wide enough for single file. Looking down, the depths seem
      impossibly far; looking up, the rim offers false promise of safety.
    composition_notes: |
      Vertiginous view down the switchbacks, emphasizing the hairpin turns

      A high-ceilinged vaulted hall, its stone ribs arching overhead like
      the bones of some massive creature. Brass brazier rows line the walls,
      cold and dark before activation but positioned with ritual precision.
      The central aisle leads to the basalt plinth with its runic drainage
      grooves.

      The air is thick, stale, hot—breathing feels like swallowing something
      solid. Ash-gray feathers litter the flagstones. A fresh scorch circle
      (no more than a week old) marks recent cult activity. This is a space
      designed for spectacular immolation.

      The transept is where paths cross—where the memorial wall meets the

      remembrance.
    visual_description: |
      A crossing point in the temple complex where the main nave intersects
      with side passages. The memorial wall and cairns are visible nearby.
      Glass walls in one direction show sealed chambers; natural stone in
      another direction leads toward escape routes.

      The architecture here shows the contrast between transformed and
      untransformed areas—where the fire's reach stopped and natural stone
      survived.
    composition_notes: |
      Wide view of the intersection, showing the multiple paths available.
      The memorial wall and cairns should be visible in one direction. The
      contrast between glass and stone should be evident.
    narrative_significance: |
      The transept is where survivors pause—between the memorial and the
      sealed chambers, between remembrance and the work of recovery. It
      represents the ongoing negotiation between grief and function.
    symbolic_elements: |
      The crossing paths represent choices. The visible memorial represents

      The trapped arch was designed to kill intruders while preserving them
      whole for burning. The needle trap that Elara disarmed represents the
      cult's cold calculation.
    visual_description: |
      A cracked arch forming a chokepoint in the temple, its stones showing
      the stress of ancient settlement. Hidden in the crack, a needle trap
      mechanism—now disarmed, its poisoned spike snapped against stone.
      The trap's housing shows careful craftsmanship.

      Beyond the arch, the path continues toward the nave. The chokepoint
      is barely wide enough for one person at a time—perfect for controlled
      elimination.
    composition_notes: |
      Close view of the arch with the trap mechanism visible in the crack.
      The narrowness of the passage should be evident. The disarmed spike
      should be visible as evidence of successful counter.
    narrative_significance: |
      Elara's detection and disabling of this trap saved the team initially.
      It represents the cult's preparation and the team's competence that
      still wasn't enough to save them.
    symbolic_elements: |
      The hidden trap represents concealed malice. The chokepoint represents
      controlled vulnerability. The disarmed mechanism represents skill that

      The vaulted ceiling represents the ambition of the temple's builders—

    visual_description: |
      Looking up into the vaulted ceiling of the nave, the stone ribs arching
      overhead like the bones of some vast creature. The craftsmanship is
      ancient but sophisticated—keystone techniques that have held for
      centuries. Light filters through gaps where roof-stones have fallen.

      The perspective emphasizes height and the weight of stone overhead.
      Soot staining marks where brazier smoke rose over generations of use.
    composition_notes: |
      Upward view into the vault, showing the rib pattern and the weight of
      stone. Light shafts through gaps should provide drama. The human
      scale should be implied by the architecture's immensity.
    narrative_significance: |
      The vaulted ceiling represents both the architectural achievement and
      the hubris of the temple's builders. It survived the transformation
      in part—some sections intact, others collapsed.
    symbolic_elements: |
      The stone ribs represent the skeleton of ambition. The height represents

      The vitrified nave represents the permanent transformation—stone
      turned to glass, a temple turned to tomb. Somber acknowledges the
      loss without descending into horror.
    visual_description: |
      The nave after transformation: walls that were stone now rippled
      translucent glass. Floors frozen mid-flow, their surfaces showing
      wave patterns like water that never crashed. Braziers fused to
      glassed floor, their brass permanently bonded to crystalline stone.

      Light behaves strangely here—multiplied by reflections, distorted
      by uneven surfaces, creating false depths and phantom images. The
      vitrification boundary is visible where natural stone gives way
      to impossible glass.
    composition_notes: |
      Wide view of the transformed nave, showing the extent of vitrification.
      The contrast between glass and surviving stone should be clear. Light
      effects should emphasize the strangeness of the space.
    narrative_significance: |
      This is what the dragon-fire created—a crystalline tomb that preserves
      everything in frozen distortion. The nave is no longer a temple but
      a memorial to catastrophic power.
    symbolic_elements: |
      The vitrified stone represents transformation that cannot be undone.

    visual_description: |
      City Watch patrol members at the canyon rim, looking down at smoke

      is departing at speed. The lead patrol member's face shows the moment
      of recognition—this is not a normal scene.

      Below, the glass surfaces are visible, catching light in ways that
      signal something has gone terribly wrong. The patrol's professional
      demeanor is tested by what they're seeing.
