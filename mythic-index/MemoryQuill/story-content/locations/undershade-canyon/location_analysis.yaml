  narrative_soul: |
    Undershade Canyon is where heroes became legends and companions became ghosts behind glass. This is the wound that opened the story—an ancient ritual site transformed by catastrophic dragon-fire into a crystalline tomb that preserves the exact moment of sacrifice. The glass doesn't just seal the dead; it displays them, making survivors into witnesses who can see their fallen comrades but never reach them. Every vitrified surface is a window into loss, every frozen ripple a reminder that stone can become transparent but grief only hardens. The canyon now exists as equal parts hazard, memorial, and trauma—a place the living visit to honor the dead and, perhaps, to understand why they survived when others didn't.

  transformation_arc: |
    The canyon transforms across three temporal states that represent the story's emotional arc:
    
    BEFORE (historical): A place of danger—ancient, corrupted, used for draconic cult rituals. The Company enters as professionals doing a job.
    
    DURING (the Incident): Catastrophe. Dragon-fire creates a serpent construct, stone melts, a captain sacrifices themselves to collapse the escape route and seal the threat. Ignis vanishes. Glass seals comrades in transparent tombs.
    
    AFTER (present): Memorial and wound. The canyon is now cordoned, visited only by authorized teams and mourners. It has become sacred ground—not through worship but through blood. The survivors' relationship to this place defines who they are now.
    
    For characters, the canyon represents the before/after line of their lives. Everyone who enters after the Incident must reckon with what this place cost.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Geological formation adapted as ancient draconic ritual complex, catastrophically transformed by magical fire into vitrified labyrinth"
  primary_materials:
    - "Ochre sedimentary stone with darker igneous intrusions"
    - "Shale caprock at rim"
    - "Basalt (plinth, ritual elements)"
    - "Brass (brazier rows)"
    - "Vitrified glass (post-Incident transformation—rippled, bubble-trapped, translucent)"
    - "Ash deposits (flour-fine, pervasive)"
  scale_impression: "Vast geological throat that dwarfs human presence, descending from wind-scoured rim to enclosed ritual spaces, then to glassed chambers where architecture melts into frozen waves—human scale insignificant against forces that liquefy stone"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Three visual signatures define this place:
    1. The OCHRE BANDS—sedimentary layers spanning millennia, cut by darker igneous ribs, the rim catching molten-brass evening light. Geological drama that makes human presence temporary.
    2. The DRAGON PILLARS—vine-strangled threshold markers with coiled dragon carvings, now partially root-displaced, marking the boundary between mundane canyon and sacred (profane) space.
    3. The GLASS—rippled translucent walls that were stone, frozen mid-flow with trapped bubbles and distorted shapes, preserving the catastrophe like amber preserves insects. Where lantern light touches vitrified surface, everything multiplies and distorts.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Silence that isn't peaceful. The canyon swallows sound in its glassed chambers—voices that once echoed now die in muffled absorption. But the glass speaks: ping and crackle as it contracts during night cooling, a subtle percussion that sounds like the place settling into its new form. Wind at the rim carries distant notes. In the fissured gallery, whisper-corridors channel air into breathy sighs. The absence of the chanting that once filled this space is itself a sound—a void where ritual voices used to shape reality.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Layered geology and recent violence: dry sage and brimstone on the thermal updrafts at the rim (the canyon breathes). Inside, stale heat with metallic undertones—copper and ozone strongest near the Ignis locus, a scent that shouldn't persist but does. Ash everywhere, dust-dry and throat-catching. In summer, the vitrified zones carry the smell of radiant stone—hot metal without the metal. The brass braziers, long cold, still hold faint traces of whatever fuel once burned green-white.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Temperature gradients tell the story: warm updrafts at the rim, oppressive heat trapped in glassed chambers even when the air outside is cool (the glass radiates stored energy like a fever that won't break). Surfaces range from sun-warm shale (friable, prone to flake) to slick vitrified glaze (treacherous, beautiful) to ash-soft crusts that compress under weight. The glass itself is smooth but wrong—stone shouldn't feel like this. Edges are razor-keen where crazing has occurred. Everything is dry; moisture is a memory here.

  light_character: |
    Light behaves strangely here. At the rim, natural canyon light works as expected—the ochre walls catch golden-hour illumination beautifully, evening light turning stone to molten brass. But once you descend into the glassed zones, light becomes a trickster. Lantern glow struggles against smoke residue and glass refractions—every illumination source multiplies, distorts, creates false depths and phantom movements. The vitrified walls act as imperfect mirrors and lenses, bending light around corners, creating bright spots and dead zones. The glass "remembers" the green-white fire—not literally, but visually, in the way certain angles produce an unsettling ghost-shimmer. At dawn (the safest operating window), light shafts penetrate through lost roof stones and fissures, creating dramatic columns of illumination in otherwise shadow-drowned spaces.
    
  weather_influence: |
    The canyon has its own weather. Strong thermal updrafts at twilight—the canyon breathes, exhaling sage and brimstone. These updrafts affect sound (chant carries impossibly far), visibility (dust and ash lift on currents), and planning (approach timing matters). Night cooling causes the glass to contract, creating audible pings and crackles—the place settling into darkness with a percussive voice. Winter brings freeze-thaw cycles that widen crazing webs, increase spall risk, and can frost certain glass panes to opacity at first light. Storm flash flows scour the canyon floor, remobilize ash, and can undercut the ritual circle grooves. The location demands respect for its rhythms.

contextual_place:
  region: "Remote canyon system, arid/semi-arid terrain"
  neighborhood_character: "Isolated geological formation in wilderness—no permanent settlement, difficult approach, the kind of place that hides what doesn't want to be found. The surrounding terrain is harsh enough that the cult chose this site for its inaccessibility as much as its draconic resonance."
  
  approach_sequences:
    - name: "South Switchbacks (primary approach)"
      description: "Steep descent from the rim along the south wall, hairpin turns cutting back and forth across the canyon face. Sections are glazed with thin vitrified coating from older fire events—treacherous sheen over friable scree that can slip away underfoot. Requires belay on worst segments. Views open onto the canyon depths, revealing the scale of the place and, eventually, the glint of glass where stone should be."
      first_impression: "Precarious beauty—the ochre walls catching light, the drop demanding focus, the glimpse of wrongness below where surfaces shine too smoothly"
      
    - name: "Fissured Gallery (alternate/overwatch route)"
      description: "Side corridor at mid-depth, following a natural crack in the canyon wall that rises to a high escarpment overlooking the nave. Narrower, quieter, used for observation and flanking. Emerges onto a ledge with a commanding view of the ritual space below."
      first_impression: "Hidden passage, tactical advantage, the sense of seeing without being seen—and then the revelation of the transformed nave spread below like a diorama of tragedy"
      
  visible_beyond:
    - direction: "Up (from depths)"
      what_visible: "Rim silhouette against sky, shale caprock edge, sometimes figures of rim station personnel backlit against light"

      what_visible: "Surrounding badlands, distant terrain, the isolation that made this site attractive for hidden rituals"
    - direction: "Through (glass walls)"
      what_visible: "What the glass preserves—distorted but legible shapes, the forms of what was sealed within, the crystalline record of catastrophe"
      
  spatial_relationship: "The canyon is a wound in the earth—a vertical space that demands descent, that pulls you down into its depths. The approach sequence is a transition from open sky to enclosed stone to glassed chambers, each stage more confined and more transformed than the last. The relationship between rim and depths mirrors the relationship between present and past—from up here, you can see it; down there, you're in it."

Vines and moss have claimed the soft-stone capitals, root intrusions have displaced the lintel fragments that once connected them. The reliefs show scales and coils, now eroded but still legible—ancient artists depicting the power this place was built to channel. The space between the pillars is a ceremonial pinch point, acoustically designed to amplify voices entering the nave beyond.

    physical_description: |
      BEFORE: Multi-bay vaulted hall, high ceilings supported by ribs and spandrels. Brass brazier rows stand along the walls in rhythmic array, designed to ignite as one in response to dragon-tongue chanting. At the center, the basalt plinth altar dominates—dark stone with runic grooves cut into its surface, meant to drain ritual offerings into a circumferential collection ring. The air was thick with stale heat, dense and oppressive. Ash-gray feathers littered the flagstones. The acoustic amplified even whispers.
      
      AFTER: The nave is a glass tomb. Walls flash-melted into rippled translucent planes preserve shapes and shadows in crystalline distortion. The floor rippled mid-flow, creating pools of vitrified stone that reflect and refract light in unsettling patterns. The braziers still stand, now fused to the floor. The basalt plinth remains, darker against the surrounding glass, a solid anchor in a space that has become liquid frozen. Bodies and equipment sealed within the glass are visible—distorted but clear enough to recognize, making the nave a memorial that cannot be looked away from.
      
    narrative_function: "The heart of the catastrophe—where the ritual was conducted, where the serpent formed, where fire transformed stone. Every significant moment of the Incident happened in view of this space. It is both crime scene and memorial, sacred ground desecrated and then re-sanctified by sacrifice."

      Once a narrow passage created by a load-bearing pillar, providing a transient low-flux zone when the serpent construct's radius passed—a gap that could be used for timed runs. Now crushed inward by deliberate keystone collapse.

    physical_description: |
      Stone cairns built from canyon rubble, each marking a fallen companion. Names carved in blood—literally blood mixed with stone dust to create a lasting pigment—mark a designated wall section. The memorial exists in a relatively protected area, accessible via the fissured gallery without requiring passage through the most hazardous glassed zones. Offerings accumulate: stones, cords, written names sealed in wax. No lanterns are set on glass here; the etiquette is scrupulous. This is where the living honor the dead.
      
    narrative_function: "The heart of grief—where loss becomes ritual, where the dead are named and remembered. This is the canyon's redemption: the place where horror is transmuted into honor, where those who died protecting others are remembered by those they protected."
