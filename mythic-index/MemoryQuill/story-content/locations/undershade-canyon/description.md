# Undershade Canyon – Physical Description

## Visual Summary

**Before the Event**: Undershade Canyon is a vast throat of ochre-banded sedimentary rock cut by darker igneous ribs, the rim catching the last molten-brass gleam of evening light. The descent via treacherous south switchbacks—where ancient fire left thin vitrified glazing over friable scree—offers glimpses of what lies below: vine-strangled threshold pillars carved with dragon coils marking entry to a shadowed cleft. The approach funnels through compressed space before opening into the vaulted nave, a high-ceilinged chamber of ancient stone where brass brazier rows stand cold and dark along the walls. At the center, a basalt plinth altar dominates the floor, its surface grooved with runic channels meant to drain ritual offerings. The air carries persistent warmth from depth-fires, lifting sage and brimstone notes on thermal updrafts. Feathers—charred to ash-gray—litter the flagstones like forgotten offerings, and fresh scorch circles (no more than a week old) mark recent cultist activity. The temple breathes with thick, stale heat and an acoustic that amplifies even whispered words. This is a place designed for ritual, where natural concealment and stone acoustics serve those who would call upon ancient powers.

**During the Event**: The brazier rows ignite as one in response to dragon-tongue chanting, tongues of green-white flame leaping upward to form a shimmering lattice across the doorway—heat so fierce it warps the air like ripples in molten glass. On the canyon floor beyond, runes carved into stone blaze core-hot, feeding power to the ritual. The heat-veil convulses, molding itself into a serpentine silhouette—flames knitting scales of emerald and white as the fire is given draconic form. The air becomes forge-hot, an alchemical flash hotter than any furnace, searing lungs and blistering exposed skin. Sound overwhelms: the mass chanting of cultists shaping ancient syllables into a rising note that makes the very stone vibrate, the roar of supernatural fire, the groaning of architecture under impossible heat. Light eclipses sight—blinding white-gold as the ritual reaches its crescendo. Stone begins to flow like water, arches sag under their own liquefying weight, and floors ripple as reality itself bends under the strain of forces meant to be channeled, not unleashed.

**After the Event**: The canyon has become a tomb of glass and echoes. What was ancient stone is now transformed: walls flash-melted into rippled translucent glass that holds shapes and shadows in frozen waves, preserving everything in crystalline distortion. Where dragon-fire touched, architecture sealed: arches collapsed and cooled into barriers, corridors fused shut, chambers became transparent prisons that show their contents but permit no entry. The floor itself rippled into glassy pools that reflect light in unsettling patterns, creating endless refractions. The quality of light has changed—golden lantern-glow struggles against lingering smoke and the strange refractions of glass walls that multiply and distort any illumination. The air remains oppressive with residual heat from fires that refuse to fully cool. Sound dies in glass-muffled silence; the acoustic that once amplified chanting now swallows voices. Ash lies flour-fine over everything, and the silence is not peaceful but pregnant, as if the canyon holds its breath. The glass walls serve as witnesses—distorted but clear enough to see through—showing what was sealed within: bodies, equipment, the final moments preserved in translucent amber. For those who survived, the canyon is haunted not by spirits but by crystalline memory, by glass that showed everything yet permitted nothing, that made witnesses of the helpless and transformed grief into a weight measured in blood and broken stone.

This is a place of temporal layers where geological drama (ochre bands, igneous ribs, shale caprock spanning millennia) meets ancient architectural ambition (dragon pillars, vaulted spaces, ritual channels carved centuries ago), recent violence (week-old scorch marks, cultist arrangements), catastrophic transformation (stone turned to glass in moments), and aftermath (three days of excavation, memorial cairns, names carved in blood). The canyon functions as threshold, crucible, tomb, and memorial—a space where human scale becomes insignificant against forces that melt stone and trap souls in translucent barriers, where lantern light persists not as comfort but as defiance against a place designed for spectacular immolation.

## Geography & Site Analysis

- Location & Terrain: A deep, ochre‑banded canyon system with shale caprock at the rim and sedimentary walls cut by darker igneous intrusions. Evening updrafts carry dry heat from the depths even in early autumn. Sage and brimstone notes are common on the wind. [FIRM ch1]
- Site Advantages: Natural concealment and acoustics for ritual activity; multiple vantage points from rim escarpments; fissures providing flanking ledges above interior spaces. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Environmental Factors:
  - Thermal: Persistent warm updrafts; pockets of superheated air in enclosed chambers. [FIRM]
  - Surface Hazards: South switchbacks glazed by older fire events—vitrified sheen over treacherous scree. [FIRM]
  - Dust/Ash: Flour‑fine ash deposits; glass spall risk in transformed zones. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Approach Routes:
  - South Switchbacks: Fastest descent but hazardous due to vitrified glaze; belay strongly advised. [FIRM]
  - Fissured Gallery: Side corridor at mid‑depth linking to a high escarpment overlooking the nave. [FIRM]
  - Service Spurs: Narrow cracks to rim perches (scout use); unstable talus slopes beneath glassed arches. [IMPLIED]

## Architectural Overview (Temple/Ritual Complex)

- Construction Style: Ancient stone sanctuary adapted for draconic rites—stone vaults, basalt plinth altar element, brass brazier rows with chant‑triggered ignition behavior. [FIRM]
- Primary Materials:
  - Masonry: Sedimentary wall stone with inset basalt elements at plinth and floor runes; lime‑based mortars; ritual conduits cut into floor. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Metalwork: Brass braziers in rhythmic array; trap hardware (needle/poison mechanism); occasional iron pins at repaired ribs. [FIRM]
  - Vitreous Layer (Post‑Event): Translucent, rippled glass formed by dragon‑fire; localized bubble fields; crazing along stress lines. [FIRM]
- Overall Layout: Rim → switchbacks → cleft with vine‑strangled draconic pillars (threshold) → vaulted nave (braziers, basalt plinth with runic drainage grooves) → side fissured gallery to high ledge → narrow antechamber beyond a load‑bearing pillar (heat‑shadow gap) → exterior ritual circle on canyon floor aligned to temple axis. [FIRM]

## Detailed Structural Analysis

### 1) Rim and Descent System

- Dimensions & Scale: Canyon rim wide enough for small party staging; switchback path descending steeply along south wall with multiple hairpins. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Construction Details: Natural ledges and handholds; glazed patch runs (old fire) present a thin glass skin over friable scree. [FIRM]
- Distinctive Features: Wind shear zones; lantern light carries far at twilight; shale edges prone to flake under point loads. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Condition: Mixed—sound where unglazed; severe slip hazard where vitrified. [FIRM]

### 2) Threshold – Vine‑Strangled Pillars

- Dimensions & Scale: Narrow gorge pinch hosting paired pillars with coiled dragon carvings; lintel fragments and root intrusion. [FIRM]
- Construction Details: Soft stone capitals overtaken by vine and moss; reliefs show scaled coils, now eroded; footing partially undercut by seasonal scours. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Function: Ceremonial gate to nave; acoustically amplifies chant ingress. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

### 3) Vaulted Nave & Basalt Plinth

- Dimensions & Scale: Multi‑bay vaulted hall; rows of brass braziers; central basalt plinth with heirloom orb (during incident). [FIRM]
- Construction Details:
  - Braziers wired by rite—chant resonance sequence ignites a green‑white heat lattice at the doorway (convective “cage”). [FIRM]
  - Floor Runics: Grooves cut to drain/feed energetic fluids/heat; circumferential collection ring suggests closed‑loop ritual plumbing. [FIRM]
  - Traps: Needle trap at cracked arch (poisoned spike designed to preserve subjects “whole for burning”). [FIRM]
- Layout: Aisle to plinth; brazier banks parallel walls; a trapped arch near egress forms choke. [FIRM]
- Condition (Pre‑Event): Stale, dense heat; ash‑gray feathers on stone; scorched circle ≤ 1 week fresh pre‑arrival. [FIRM]
- Condition (Post‑Event): Molten transformation fused significant spans into rippled glass—floors, lower ribs, and arch edges; doorway cage locus vitrified. [FIRM]

### 4) Side Fissured Gallery & High Escarpment

- Geometry: Narrow corridor in outer wall rising to a ledge with full view of the nave. [FIRM]
- Purpose: Flanking overwatch and alternate egress; used for counter‑chant archery disruption. [FIRM]
- Hazards: Falling glaze flakes; ankle‑trap fissures; rockfall from vented roof stones. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

### 5) Exterior Ritual Circle (Canyon Floor)

- Components: Rune stelae, incised channels, spiral intake geometry; when active, runes blaze core‑hot and feed serpent construct in nave. [FIRM]
- Power Behavior: Energy ingestion from chant and possibly life‑force coupling (observed surge on chanter death). [FIRM]
- Drainage/Conduction: Channels slope to a circumferential ring; basalt and metal salts likely enhance heat conduction. [IMPLIED]

### 6) Antechamber & Load‑Bearing Pillar (Heat‑Shadow Gap)

- Structural Role: Pillar creates a transient low‑flux corridor when serpent radius passes—narrowed opening used for timed run. [FIRM]
- Collapse Event: Gap crushed inward; acting captain wedged shield and then deliberately collapsed keystone above to seal dragon‑fire at cost of life. [FIRM]
- Post‑Event Geometry: Rubble choke beyond fused wall; load redistributed to flanks; talus of glass‑slag and stone. [FIRM]

### 7) Glassed Labyrinth (Post‑Catastrophe)

- Morphology: Translucent walls/floors with flow ripples, lensing effects, trapped bubbles; localized spall; “frit‑fall” talus beneath overhangs. [FIRM]
- Mechanical Behavior:
  - Crazing webs widen under rapid temperature change; edges razor‑keen.
  - Some panels ring/ping on night cooling; heavy vibration frowned upon. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Borin Breach: Hammer strikes induced a spiderweb fracture and partial breakthrough—gap dimension insufficient for evac without widening; area retains blood staining and glass chips. [FIRM]

### 8) Ignis Vanishing Locus

- Signature: Perfect circle of scorched floor; barrier ripple “lens” in nearby glass plane; odor of copper and ozone; no body, no ash. [FIRM]
- Interpretation: Planar‑grade surge or high‑energy shunting through or tangential to barrier; residual thermal gradient atypical. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Safety: Do not disturb ring; note intermittent copper glints in dim light (afterimages). [FIRM/IMPLIED]

## Physical Systems & Infrastructure

### Structural Engineering

- Foundations: Sedimentary bedding with intrusive basalt ribs; temple footings cut into competent strata; pillar carries load to sound ledges. [IMPLIED]
- Load Paths: Vault thrust to outer walls; pillar load shared with rib spandrels; post‑event, thrust rebalanced around collapsed keystone bay. [IMPLIED]
- Vitrified Layer: Glass adheres to substrate; differential expansion creates stress lines; avoid prying frozen interfaces without thermal control. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

### Environmental Controls

- Ventilation: Limited cross‑flow via fissures and lost roof stones; thermal stratification maps (cool sink near floor pre‑event; hot glaze radiance post‑event). [IMPLIED/FIRM]
- Heat Management: None during ritual; post‑event protocols rely on timing (dawn cool) and shielded paths. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Lighting: Natural shafts through ribs; high reflectivity amplifies lantern glare; green‑white flame memory persists as ghosting in vitreous sheen (visual, not literal). [FIRM/IMPLIED]

### Water & Drainage

- Dry site; storm flash flows scour canyon floor and can remobilize ash; temple grooves fed circle (energy, not water) during rite; standing water rare except in shaded sumps after storms. [IMPLIED]
- Interceptors: None historical; patrols place temporary scuppers for cleanup when needed. [IMPLIED]

### Climate Protection

- Storm Protocols: Avoid glass overhangs; shelter in intact vault segments; talus movement expected.
- Thermal Protocols: Work at dawn/early night; carry wet cloths; monitor oxygen debt in enclosed glassed zones. [IMPLIED]

## Security & Access

- Chokepoints: Threshold pillars; trapped arch; brazier lattice line; load‑pillar heat‑shadow corridor; glass breach site. [FIRM]
- Rescue/Extraction: Shield sled path validated; stretcher routes mapped via fissured gallery; belay points set on rim stations; memorial wall near transept. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Post‑Event Measures: “No spark” rule in glassed nave; protective wraps for hands/boots; shard guards. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

## Immersive Sensory Environment

### Visual Landscape

- Dominant Visuals: Ochre band walls; draconic pillars; brass lines; basalt plinth; then surreal vitreous planes—rippled, lensing, with trapped bubbles and flow striae. [FIRM]
- Material Textures: Sun‑warm shale; slick vitrified glaze; ash‑soft crust; pitted brass; melted stone like frozen water. [FIRM]
- Color Palette: Ochre and iron‑red sediment; basalt black; brass gold; green‑white fire memory; copper‑red glints at vanishing locus; lantern gold. [FIRM]

### Acoustic Environment

- Sound: Chant threads carry from abyss; muffled silence behind thick glass; ping/crackle as glass contracts at night; shield scrape echoes in galleries. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Zones: Wind‑loud rim; hot, still nave; whisper corridors where fissures channel breeze. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

### Environmental Atmosphere

- Air Quality: “Breathing glass” sensation in heat lattice events; brimstone and sage at rim; copper‑ozone near vanishing locus; dust‑ash irritant. [FIRM]
- Comfort: Dawn workable; midday oppressive; glass radiance adds radiant load even when ambient cool. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

## Temporal & Seasonal Variations

### Daily Changes

- Twilight: Updrafts strongest; chant carry maximized; lantern luminosity contrasts with deepening canyon. [FIRM]
- Night: Glass pings on cooling; downdrafts occasionally pool smoke; fogging on glass in cold snaps. [IMPLIED]
- Dawn: Best window for safe movement and extraction. [IMPLIED]

### Seasonal Adaptations

- Summer: Convection amplifies hazard; avoid midday operations.
- Winter: Freeze‑thaw opens crazing webs; spall risk increases; certain glass planes become opaque with frost at first light. [IMPLIED]

### Weather Response Patterns

- Fair Weather: Stable ash crust; safe ledge walking with caution on glazed patches.
- Storms: Flash flow may undercut ritual circle grooves; falling debris from vaulted ribs; visibility reduced. [IMPLIED]
- Extreme: Thermal shock can fracture glass sheets; avoid percussion. [IMPLIED]
