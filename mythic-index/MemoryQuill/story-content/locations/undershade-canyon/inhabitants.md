# Undershade Canyon – Inhabitants (Physical Usage Focus)

## Basic Demographics
- Occupancy Type: No resident population; intermittent site usage only due to hazards. [FIRM]
- User Groups:
  - City Watch/Rescue Details: 4–8 per entry team; rim support 2–4; retrieval details surge to 10–14 with stretcher crews during operations. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Scavengers/Prospectors: 1–3 individuals; deterred post‑Incident by cordon and hazard signage. [IMPLIED]
  - Cult Remnants/Illicit Actors: Cells 3–7 when active historically; present activity suppressed; any sign triggers full lockdown and evidence chain. [IMPLIED]
  - Mourners/Pilgrims: Small parties 1–5 to cairns and memorial wall; escorted during sanctioned visits. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Dwell Time Windows:
  - Rim Stations: 15–90 minutes staging/observations. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Interior Zones: 10–40 minutes per sector; cumulative under 2 hours per entry in summer; winter caps reduced to 60–75 minutes. [IMPLIED]
- Prohibited: Open flame below rim; percussion on glass; unsupervised access to ritual circle or vitrified nave. [FIRM]

## Space Usage Mapping

- Rim Stations & Staging Ledges
  - Users: Watch leads (2), belay tech (1–2), scribe/runner (1). [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Functions: Anchor checks, rope issue, PPE inspection, briefing board; memorial oversight. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Notes: Windward position; signal flags; stretcher hoist points marked. [IMPLIED]

- South Switchbacks (Descent Path)
  - Users: Descent file 1–2 at a time, spaced 20–30 ft; belay from above on glazed segments. [FIRM]
  - Functions: Primary access under supervision; tool lowers on separate line. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Hazards: Vitrified glaze over friable scree; shale flake under point load. [FIRM]

- Fissured Gallery → High Escarpment (Overwatch Route)
  - Users: Overwatch pair (2), stretcher relay (2–4), archer/spotter if needed (1). [FIRM]
  - Functions: Alternate egress; observation on nave; quiet corridor transit. [FIRM]
  - Protocols: Silence zone; no lantern flare to avoid lensing flash; chalk marks for return. [IMPLIED]

- Threshold Pillars (Gate Pinch)
  - Users: Entry control (1–2); counter‑chant overwatch historically. [FIRM]
  - Functions: Check “no‑spark” compliance; shard guards; line‑count through chokepoint. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Notes: Root‑displaced footing; footing checks after storms. [IMPLIED]

- Vaulted Nave (Brazier Rows & Basalt Plinth)
  - Access: Restricted; max 4–6 personnel in space at once; strict pathing flags. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Functions: Survey, retrieval, documentation; evidence chain around plinth grooves; temperature logging. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - PPE/Rules: Leather over‑wraps on hands/boots, face cloths, eye protection; “no spark” rule enforced. [FIRM]

- Trapped Arch (Choke) & Heat‑Shadow Corridor (Historical)
  - Status: Arch trap location marked and bypassed; load‑pillar corridor now compromised/blocked by keystone collapse. [FIRM]
  - Use: No current passage; study only from safe stand‑off. [FIRM]

- Antechamber Beyond Collapse
  - Status: Rubble choke; fused wall faces; oxygen‑poor pocket risk. [FIRM]
  - Access: Prohibited; do not attempt clearance without engineered plan (none authorized). [FIRM]

- Glassed Labyrinth (Post‑Event Vitrified Zone)
  - Access: Permit‑only; 2–3 personnel; safety lead required. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Functions: Damage survey; sample collection (micro‑flakes only); pathfinding for memorial maintenance. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Protocols: No percussion; thermal control awareness; avoid large pane edges; retreat on “ping/crackle” escalation. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

- Exterior Ritual Circle (Canyon Floor)
  - Access: Cordon line with flagged perimeter; research‑only under writ. [FIRM]
  - Functions: Photogrammetry; slope/undercut inspections after storms; mineral residue sampling with non‑reactive tools. [IMPLIED]
  - Prohibitions: No chant/prayer vocalizations in draconic; no liquid pours; no metallic scraping on incised channels. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

- Memorial Wall & Cairns (Near Transept)
  - Users: Watch chaplain or designated escort (1), mourners 1–5. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Functions: Care of inscriptions, stone placement, quiet observances. [FIRM]
  - Etiquette: No lanterns set on glass; offerings limited to stones, cords, written names sealed in wax. [IMPLIED]

- Temporary Camps & Sanitary
  - Location: Rim only, lee of caprock; no bivouac below rim. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
  - Facilities: Cold camp protocol; latrine pits downwind; pack‑out standard for waste in winter. [IMPLIED]

## Operational Rhythms
- Dawn (Preferred Window): Entry, survey, retrieval; lowest radiant load; glass contraction near neutral. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Midday: No interior operations in summer; in winter, short forays with strict timers. [IMPLIED]
- Twilight: Observation from rim; no interior movement due to rising updrafts and visual distortion. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Night: Prohibited interior; monitoring for trespass; audible “ping” logs from glass contraction. [FIRM/IMPLIED]

## Roles, Gear, and Safety
- Roles: Safety Lead (rope and thermal), Scribe (log/evidence), Spotter (acoustic/visual), Medic (hypoxia/burn), Porter (sled/rope), Escort (memorial). [IMPLIED]
- PPE: Shard guards, leather wraps, eye shields, damp cloths, crampons for glaze segments, sand flasks for grip, canvas path flags, long tongs, felt‑lined trays for fragments. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Tools: Non‑sparking bronze/wood implements, wedge pads, shield sled, belay kits, scuppers for post‑storm ash. [IMPLIED]
- Alarms/Signals: Whistle codes suppressed; rope‑tug patterns and hand signs used in nave; rim bell for recall. [IMPLIED]

## Wildlife and Environmental Presence
- Observed: Rock bats in upper fissures, heat‑tolerant insects; occasional glass lizards near warm panes. [IMPLIED/FLEXIBLE]
- Interaction: Avoid disturbance; note colony shifts after storms or freeze‑thaw. [FLEXIBLE]

## Notes
- Flow Segregation: Clean (memorial/observation) vs. dirty (retrieval/survey) routes maintained; tools do not cross into memorial zone. [IMPLIED]
- Evidence Chain: Any found artifacts or residues packaged with non‑reactive media; custody transfer at rim ledger. [IMPLIED]
- Seasonal Adjustments: Winter reduces team size and dwell time; spall risk highest at first light after freeze. [IMPLIED]
