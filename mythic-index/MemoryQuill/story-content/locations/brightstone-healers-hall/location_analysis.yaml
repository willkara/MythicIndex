  narrative_soul: |
    Brightstone Healers' Hall is where the wounded confront the question that defines them: do you erase the pain or carry it forward as proof of what you survived? This isn't merely a hospital—it's a threshold between the person trauma broke and the person healing might create. For Veyra, these pale stone walls witnessed the first choice that would shape the Last Light Company's entire philosophy: that scars are not failures to heal but evidence of battles won.
    
  one_line_essence: "Where the wounded choose who they become"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "The choice between erasure and integration"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Professional competence as a form of compassion"
      - "Light filtered through gauze—clarity softened by mercy"
      - "The body as archive of experience"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "magical solution vs. natural process"
      - "sterile efficiency vs. human warmth"
      - "forgetting as kindness vs. memory as identity"
      - "institutional care vs. personal relationship"

  transformation_arc: |
    The Hall itself doesn't change, but the characters' relationship to it does. Initially it represents clinical distance—a place Veyra wakes disoriented, surrounded by strangers. Through Dokra Ironvein's wisdom, it transforms into a site of crucial understanding. By the time Veyra leaves, Brightstone has become a philosophical anchor point—proof that professional excellence and genuine care can coexist, a model the Company will later emulate in their own approach to trauma.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Functional civic-medical architecture—hygiene-first planning with clear circulation hierarchies"

  scale_impression: "Substantial urban civic building—imposing enough to convey institutional competence, not so grand as to intimidate the injured"
  
  visual_signature: |
    Pale bone-white walls meeting tall mullioned windows that lattice daylight into soft geometric patterns. The gauze screens transform harsh city sun into diffused warmth. Overhead, dwarven rune-lamp rails cast shadowless illumination—no flicker, no drama, just steady clarity. Every surface reads as scrubbed, ordered, purposeful.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Muffled. The thick stone walls reduce Waterdeep's street noise to a distant wash. Inside: the soft percussion of footsteps on flagged stone, the gentle bubbling of sterilization apparatus, the clink of instruments being cleaned, low professional voices. Recovery wards are deliberately hushed—sound-absorbing hangings swallow conversation before it can carry.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Thyme and antiseptic form the dominant chord—herbaceous sharpness over a clean alcohol base. Beneath it, fainter notes: laundered linen, limewash, boiled water steam. Near the cellar stairs or sterilization suite, a distinctive coppery-cinnamon edge from instrument baths and alchemical tinctures.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Smooth cool stone underfoot. Bronze handrails worn to warmth by countless hands. Linen sheets laundered to soft precision. The air itself feels filtered—stable temperature regardless of street weather, neither drafty nor stale, maintained by passive stack ventilation that moves without calling attention to itself.

  light_character: |
    Two complementary systems create the Hall's distinctive illumination. Daylight enters through tall mullioned windows, broken into geometric fragments by leading, softened by gauze into diffused warmth. In operating theatres and corridors, dwarven rune-lamp rails provide unwavering shadowless light—no flicker, no harsh edge, tuned cooler for precision work and warmer in recovery wards for patient comfort. The combination reads as both clinical and kind.
    
  weather_influence: |
    The thick masonry buffers most weather effects—Waterdeep's sea dampness and seasonal swings barely penetrate. Storm shutters protect street-facing windows during severe weather. The real weather impact is logistical: storms drive emergency intake to the side sally, damp weather increases the load on drying lofts, winter protocols include draft baffles and distributed braziers.

contextual_place:
  region: "Trades Ward, Waterdeep—central urban location along a busy commercial artery"
  neighborhood_character: "Working professional district—craftsmen, merchants, civic services. Street-level energy of cart traffic and commerce, but respectable enough that the Hall's presence feels natural rather than incongruous."
