# Brightstone Healers’ Hall – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Urban medical hall set within a busy Trades Ward artery of Waterdeep. Street grade is modestly crowned; adjacent lanes provide service access for laundry and night-soil carts. Ambient city noise is filtered by thick stone walls and mullioned windows with gauze screens. [FIRM: ch02, ch04, ch2.5]
- Site Advantages: Central proximity to Watch routes and markets; ample daylight from tall street-facing windows; thick masonry affords thermal stability and acoustic separation; roofline accommodates lantern flues and ventilation cowls.
- Environmental Factors: Sea air dampness; soot and street dust; seasonal temperature swings; occasional storm-driven drafts through lanes.
- Approach Routes: Main public entrance on the carriage street; a discrete side door for emergency intake and stretcher traffic; rear service mews for laundry, fuel, herbal deliveries, and waste removal.

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Functional civic-medical architecture—pale, smooth ashlar with restrained string courses; broad mullioned windows; interior grounded in hygiene-first planning with segmented circulation and clear sterile boundaries. [FIRM: “pale smooth stone,” “mullioned windows,” ch02/ch04]
- Primary Materials:
  - Masonry: Pale limestone/white granite ashlar on rubble-core backing; lime mortar with smooth limewash in clinical spaces.
  - Timber/Joinery: Oak joists and stair carriages; sealed plank floors beneath scrubbed slate and flagged stone in wet rooms.
  - Metals/Glass: Leaded glass mullions; bronze handrails; copper/rune-inlaid dwarven lamp heads and conduits.
  - Surfaces: Polished stone worktops in surgery and apothecary; oiled wood in admin/library; washable gauze screens.
- Overall Layout: Four functional tiers—street level (reception/triage/operating and prep), mezzanine service band (sterilization/linen/apothecary), upper patient wards (quiet recovery, isolation), and attic/roof service (vent cowls, drying loft). A compact cellar houses boilers, cisterns, herb stills, and waste staging.

## Detailed Structural Analysis

### Ground Floor: Reception, Triage, Operating Theatres
- Dimensions & Scale: ~110 ft frontage x 60 ft depth; 16–18 ft floor height to allow high clerestory and duct runs.

## Physical Systems & Infrastructure

### Structural Engineering
- Foundations: Continuous stone footings with underpinning beneath theatre block; vibration-minimized joist spans over sensitive rooms.

## Immersive Sensory Environment

### Visual Landscape
- Dominant Visual Elements: Pale stone, clean lines, broad mullions with gauze curtains, rune-lamp halos over slate and linen.
- Material Textures: Smooth, cool stone; oiled oak; warm bronze rails; laundered linens; scrubbed slate in wet rooms.
- Color Palette: Bone-white limewash, linen cream, herb greens, bronze and copper reds, slate greys, warm amber lamp light.
- Light & Shadow: Daylight latticed by mullions; evening pools of steady rune-lamp illumination without flicker.

### Acoustic Environment
- Sound Reflection: Stone-borne footfalls softened by hangings; theatre corridors kept hushed; distant city murmur filtered to a low wash.
- Noise Sources: Gentle bubbling in apparatus; clink of instruments being cleaned; low voices at reception; muffled street carts on cobbles.
- Acoustic Zones: Waiting area conversational; theatres near-silent; wards subdued; isolation stack quietest.

### Environmental Atmosphere
- Air Quality: Fresh herbaceous overtone (thyme) across a clean antiseptic base; faint metallic-copper edge near prep and cellar stills. [FIRM: ch04]
- Scent Profiles: Laundered linen, limewash, boiled water steam, alcohol tinctures, and a trace of resin from oiled wood.
- Physical Comfort: Stable indoor temperature from mass walls; summer ventilation via clerestories; winter warmth localized at work bays.

## Temporal & Seasonal Variations

### Daily Environmental Changes
- Morning: Sun shafts through mullions; linens aired; boilers stoked; triage queue forms; teaching rounds begin.
- Midday: Full clinical tempo; rune-lamps dimmed where daylight suffices; sterilization cadence peaks.
- Evening: Wards quiet; lamps warm; records compiled; stillroom finishes last distillations.
- Night: Skeleton staff; isolation checks; low-level lamp trails; emergency intake readiness maintained.

### Seasonal Adaptations
- Spring: Increased respiratory cases; herb stocks refreshed; gutters/roof screens cleared.
- Summer: Clerestories open for stack cooling; water ration discipline for boiled supply.
- Autumn: Fire and evacuation drills; storm shutters inspected; fuel stores increased.
- Winter: Draft baffles installed; braziers distributed with guards; frost protocol for cistern lines.

### Weather Response Patterns
- Fair Weather: Windows cracked for fresh air; drying loft active; outdoor herb deliveries frequent.
- Storms: Shutters drawn; intake routed to side door; additional towel lines for floor safety.
- Extreme Weather: Water reserves prioritized; lamp-rune redundancy checks; bed reallocation to inner rooms.
