  narrative_soul: |
    Brightstone Healers' Hall is where the wounded confront the question that defines
    them: do you erase the pain or carry it forward as proof of what you survived?
    This isn't merely a hospital—it's a threshold between the person trauma broke
    and the person healing might create. The Hall wants to heal, but insists that
    healing include honoring what was survived. For Veyra, these pale stone walls
    witnessed the first choice that would shape the Last Light Company's entire
    philosophy: that scars are not failures to heal but evidence of battles won.

  scene_mood: pastoral
  mood_rationale: |
    First introduction should feel like arrival at a place of competent care—
    professional but not cold, institutional but inviting. Pastoral warmth softens
    the civic architecture without diminishing its authority.
  visual_description: |
    Morning light catches the pale limestone facade of Brightstone Healers' Hall,
    setting it apart from its weathered Trades Ward neighbors. The building rises
    three stories of bone-white ashlar, tall mullioned windows climbing its face—
    each pane catching light differently through the leaded divisions, white gauze
    curtains visible behind the glass. The main entrance announces itself through
    a modest but dignified portico, bronze doors beneath a carved stone lintel.
    Street traffic passes—a cart, figures walking, a delivery mews visible at the
    corner—but the Hall stands apart, an island of deliberate calm within the
    city's commercial flow. Roof cowls and vent stacks rise discreetly above the
    slate roofline. This is a place that takes its work seriously.
  composition_notes: |
    Three-quarter view showing the street-facing facade and entry approach.
    Medium-wide framing to establish the building's presence within its urban
    context—neighboring commercial structures visible but secondary. Morning
    angle brings warmth to the limestone without harsh shadows.
  narrative_significance: |
    This is where Veyra wakes after the dragon attack, where she makes the choice
    that defines her approach to trauma and leadership. Before we enter, we need
    to understand what kind of place this is: a civic institution with the gravitas
    to back its promises.

      The working cellar beneath the Hall—a practical space of copper and stone.
      Compact coal-fired boilers stand on stone plinths, their copper kettles
      providing hot water and steam for sterilization. Covered stone cisterns
      line one wall, fed from roof leaders. Herb stills bubble quietly in a corner,
      producing the tinctures and distillates the apothecary uses. Sealed jars hold
      sharps for disposal; closed tubs stage infectious waste for the night-soil
      service. A hand-pump stand provides emergency water access. The air carries

      Evening in the recovery ward. The mullioned window is dark now, but the
      bronze rune-lamp on the wall casts warm amber light. Two figures—one in
      the bed, one in the chair beside it—lean toward each other with the
      particular attention of meaningful conversation. Veyra is propped against
      pillows, her scarred face turned to Dokra, listening. Dokra sits forward,
      hands open in the gesture of offering. The window behind frames them like
      a choice between worlds.

    visual_description: |
      A recovery room in morning light—the essence of what Brightstone offers.
      A tall mullioned window dominates the composition, its leaded panes breaking
      sunlight into geometric fragments. White gauze curtains hang behind the
      glass, transforming that fragmented light into something softer. The light
      falls across a simple bed with crisp linen sheets, casting the window's
      lattice pattern across white fabric. A bronze rune-lamp bracket on the wall
      stands ready for evening. Sound-absorbing hangings soften the pale stone
      walls. A chair sits beside the bed—waiting for the healer who will come.
      The room is empty but prepared, a sanctuary for whoever needs it.

      Journey-Healer Loran presents a phial of restoration essence—magical healing
      that could erase Veyra's scars entirely. She grabs his wrist and refuses.
      "This is Lysander's shield. This is Ignis's wild magic." She will carry
      the marks of those who died, not erase them.

      The recovery room in morning light, charged with tension. Veyra sits up
      in bed, her hand clamped around the apprentice healer's wrist. The young
      man holds a phial of shimmering jade-green liquid—the restoration essence
      that could erase everything. But she has said no. The light from the
      mullioned window catches the liquid, illuminates her burns. Dokra stands
      at the edge with quiet recognition. The medical tray is visible—mundane
      healing versus magical erasure made physical.

      Tight medium shot focused on the confrontation—Veyra's hand on Loran's

      The recovery room, but now inhabited by the moment that matters. Veyra
      lies in the bed, her dark hair spread on the white pillow, her face
      turned slightly toward the light. Her eyes are opening—that precise
      instant between sleep and waking. The mullioned light falls across her
      in soft geometric pattern, touching her scarred face without cruelty.
      The room is all pale stone and white linen and diffused gold light, as
      if consciousness itself were pale and soft and new.
