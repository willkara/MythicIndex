    Brightstone Healers' Hall believes in choices. It offers restoration without
    demanding erasure, healing without forgetting. Within its pale walls, patients
    decide what they keep and what they let go. The Hall asks: what do your scars
    mean? Are they wounds to hide or testimonies to carry? Here, Veyra chose to
    bear witness through her body, and the Company learned that survival is not
    the same as wholeness.

    The establishing shot captures the Hall as a place of professional sanctuary—
    clean, ordered, welcoming yet serious. The atmosphere is one of competence
    and care, not sterile coldness.

  visual_description: |
    Brightstone Healers' Hall rises from a Trades Ward street in Waterdeep, its
    pale limestone facade catching the morning light. Tall mullioned windows march
    across three floors, their gauze curtains softening the interior glow of
    rune-lamps. The main entrance sits beneath a modest stone portico, benches
    flanking for waiting families. A discrete side door handles stretcher traffic.
    Vent cowls rise from the slate roof, their copper caps catching sun. The
    street is busy with normal city traffic, but a clear zone around the entrance
    suggests respect for the Hall's purpose.

  composition_notes: |
    Wide shot from across the street, showing the full facade. The pale stone
    contrasts with darker neighboring buildings. The mullioned windows create

  narrative_significance: |
    Where Veyra recovered from Undershade Canyon, where she chose to keep her
    scars, where the Company's philosophy of honoring trauma rather than erasing
    it took root. The Hall represents healing that asks permission first.

      The apothecary and stillroom of Brightstone Healers' Hall. Stone mortar
      benches hold grinding bowls and measures. Herb racks line the walls,

      their sweet-bitter scent filling the air. A ledger desk holds dosage
