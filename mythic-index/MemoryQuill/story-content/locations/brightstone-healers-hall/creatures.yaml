creatures:
  - name: Healing Mote
    description: Luminous particles that float through the healing hall, drawn to wounds and illness. They provide gentle diagnostic light, making injuries visible to healers and bringing comfort to patients. Their presence accelerates natural healing slightly.
    visual_aspects:
      - Soft golden-white light particles the size of fireflies
      - Drift slowly like falling snow but move toward the injured
      - Cluster around wounds creating diagnostic illumination
      - Pulse gently in rhythm with patient's heartbeat
      - Warmth without heat when they touch skin
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the healing hall, especially treatment rooms
      when: Always present; population increases when many patients are being treated
      why: Manifestation of the hall's healing purpose and accumulated recovery energy
    behavior:
      who: Countless individual motes forming collective healing presence
      what: Illuminate injuries, accelerate healing, provide comfort
      how: Respond to pain and injury like immune system responding to infection
    lore: Healers use them diagnostically—motes clustering indicate hidden injuries. A patient with internal bleeding was saved when motes swarmed a seemingly minor bruise. The head healer investigated and found the true damage. "The hall itself wants everyone to heal," she says. "The motes are its way of helping us help them."

  - name: Comfort Cat
    description: An ethereal feline that appears on beds beside patients in pain or distress. It purrs with a frequency that reduces pain perception and anxiety. Not a true cat but a manifestation of compassionate care, it has soothed thousands over the decades.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent cat in soft grays and whites
      - Appears solid enough to pet; feels warm and real
      - Purr audible and tactile, creating gentle vibrations
      - Eyes infinitely compassionate and knowing
      - Leaves warmth on blankets after it vanishes
    habitat:
      where: Patient beds throughout the hall
      when: Appears beside those suffering; especially at night
      why: Manifestation of healing compassion and patient care
    behavior:
      who: Possibly multiple entities or single presence appearing as needed
      what: Provides comfort, reduces pain perception through purring
      how: Presence alone calms; purr frequency measurably reduces pain
    lore: Children especially love the Comfort Cat. A young boy recovering from a terrible accident refused to sleep without it. The cat appeared every night for three weeks until he healed. Years later he returned as a healer himself, saying: "The cat taught me what healing really means—it's not just fixing bodies, it's being present for suffering."

  - name: Medicine Sprite
    description: Tiny fey creatures that organize medical supplies with obsessive precision. They ensure nothing is ever misfiled, out of stock, or expired. They're invaluable to healers but become distressed and disruptive if their organization system is changed.
    visual_aspects:
      - Humanoid forms 3-4 inches tall in miniature healer robes
      - Carry tiny checklists and inventories visible to magical sight
      - Move with quick, efficient precision
      - Frown when supplies are used and smile when restocked
      - Leave faint trails of herbal scent
    habitat:
      where: Supply rooms, medicine cabinets, and herbal storage
      when: Constantly active; work in shifts maintaining perfect organization
      why: Emerged from the hall's need for perfect supply management
    behavior:
      who: Colony of 8-10 working in coordinated teams
      what: Organize, inventory, and preserve medical supplies
      how: Use minor preservation magic; physically rearrange supplies continuously
    lore: A new administrator once tried to reorganize the supply room "more efficiently." The Sprites went into revolt—supplies vanished and reappeared in bizarre locations, healing work ground to halt. The head healer explained gently: "They've been doing this for forty years. Their system works. Let them have it." Supplies returned to normal within an hour.

  - name: Recovery Echo
    description: Harmless phenomenon where healed patients occasionally see translucent images of others who recovered in the same bed. These echoes show the previous patients healthy and whole, offering hope and encouragement through visual proof that healing happens here.

      - Translucent figures appearing briefly in beds or rooms
      - Always shown healthy and smiling, after recovery
      - Sometimes mouth words of encouragement
      - Fade after a few seconds but leave strong impression
      - More visible to those currently suffering
    habitat:
      where: Throughout patient areas, especially long-term recovery rooms
      when: Appear to current patients, especially during moments of despair
      why: Magical imprint of successful healing creating hopeful echoes
    behavior:
      who: Thousands of echoes from decades of successful recoveries
      what: Appear briefly to offer hope through example
      how: Triggered by current patient's emotional need for encouragement
    lore: Patients report seeing "angels" or "ghosts" that smile at them and somehow communicate that everything will be alright. Healers know they're Recovery Echoes and encourage patients to take comfort. "Every person you see healed here walked out whole. You will too." One echo appears so frequently she's been nicknamed "Brightstone's Angel"—a woman who recovered from near-death and whose echo has encouraged hundreds since.
