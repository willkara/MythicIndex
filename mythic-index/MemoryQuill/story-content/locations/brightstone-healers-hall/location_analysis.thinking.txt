Let me analyze this location carefully through the five dimensions of place framework.

## Understanding the Location

**Brightstone Healers' Hall** is a critical location where Veyra Thornwake recovers after traumatic events. It's not just a hospital—it's where crucial philosophical decisions are made about memory, trauma, and identity. The key figure here is Dokra Ironvein, a master trauma surgeon who serves as a philosophical mentor.

### Physical Truth Analysis

From the description, this is:
- A pale ashlar (limestone/white granite) civic medical building
- Multi-story: ground (reception/triage/operating), mezzanine (sterilization/linen/apothecary), upper (recovery wards/isolation), attic (ventilation/drying), cellar (boilers/cisterns/waste)
- Tall mullioned windows with gauze screens
- Dwarven rune-lamp grids for shadowless illumination
- Hygiene-focused design with clean/dirty path separation
- Sensory signature: thyme and antiseptic, copper/cinnamon undertones, clinical quiet

### Narrative Soul

This is where Veyra faces "the choice"—magical erasure of trauma vs. natural healing that preserves memory as identity. The location embodies:
- The tension between forgetting and integrating pain
- Medical wisdom vs. magical solutions
- The philosophy that "some wounds are iron, some are ink"
- Professional competence balanced with patient autonomy

### Character-Space Relationships

Primary associations:
- **Veyra Thornwake**: Patient, site of recovery and crucial identity decisions
- **Dokra Ironvein**: Master surgeon, philosophical mentor figure
- **Journey-Healer Loran**: Eager apprentice representing theoretical vs. practical knowledge

### Temporal States

The documentation gives excellent daily rhythm:
- Dawn: Boilers stoked, linen aired, triage forms
- Day: Peak surgical cadence, teaching rounds


- Evening: Quiet administrative tasks unfold, with meticulous record-keeping and specialized stillroom preparations
- Night: Minimal staffing maintains emergency readiness, soft lamps casting gentle shadows

### Contextual Place
