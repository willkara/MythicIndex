## Hostile Presence

### Silent Hand Operations [FIRM ch28, ch30]

- **Personnel**: Academy-trained operatives; well-armed and disciplined
- **Function**: Monitor main routes; identify and intercept interference
- **Territory**: Control increases as one travels north toward their facility

### Unnatural Surveillance [FIRM ch30]
- **Nature**: Something evaluates travelers from shadows
- **Behavior**: Herds/funnels travelers into predictable paths
- **Effect**: Natural rhythms feel contaminated; wildlife falls silent
- **Detection**: Rangers and druids can sense wrongness

## Reconnaissance Team (ch28-30)
- **Composition**: Last Light Company members
- **Cover**: Agricultural surveyors / merchant travelers
- **Purpose**: Intelligence gathering; reconnaissance of Silent Hand facility
- **Route**: Bypassed main road through Thornwood game trails

## Wildlife & Environment

### Natural Inhabitants [IMPLIED]
- **Forest Wildlife**: Thornwood creatures (deer, wolves, birds)
- **Behavioral Change**: Animals fall silent when danger approaches [FIRM ch30]
- **Warning Sign**: Absence of normal sounds indicates threat

### Contaminated Waters [FIRM ch28]
- **Streams**: Magical suppression compounds woven into water
- **Effect**: Anyone drinking will be subdued
- **Purpose**: Silent Hand population control method
- **Detection**: Water mage (Rill) identified contamination

## Seasonal Traffic Patterns

### Spring (Canon Season) [FIRM ch28, ch30]
- **Conditions**: Muddy quagmire; difficult passage
- **Traffic**: Reduced due to conditions
- **Hazards**: Horses struggle; wagons risk getting stuck
- **Advantage**: Fewer eyes on the road

### Summer/Autumn [IMPLIED]
- **Conditions**: Better travel; higher traffic
- **Traffic**: Peak merchant and traveler movement
- **Hazards**: More Silent Hand activity likely

### Winter [IMPLIED]
- **Conditions**: Potentially impassable in places
- **Traffic**: Minimal
- **Hazards**: Weather, isolation

## Operational Patterns

### Patrol Schedule [FIRM ch30]
- **Frequency**: Regular, overlapping patterns
- **Coverage**: Main road thoroughly monitored
- **Gaps**: Game trails and cross-country routes less covered
- **Time**: Active during daylight and dusk

### Safe Passage Windows [IMPLIED]
- **Pre-dawn**: Possible movement before patrol activity
