I need to create a comprehensive location_imagery.yaml file for the Northern Road based on the analysis provided and the source files. Let me work through this systematically.

Key elements from the analysis:

1. **Location Identity:**
   - Trade route from Waterdeep north through Thornwood Forest
   - Narrative soul: "The crucible of transition—passage where competent professionals become hunters and hunted"
   - One-line essence: "Threshold where civilization yields to contaminated wilderness"

2. **Key Zones:**
   - Southern Approach (threshold)
   - Windborne Roost Waypoint (sanctuary)
   - Thornwood Corridor (liminal)
   - Northern Wilderness (perimeter)
   - Rocky Outcrop Observation Post (perimeter)

3. **Recommended Images (from analysis):**
   - Primary: Thornwood Corridor establishing shot (ominous)
   - Primary: Windborne Roost essence shot (tense/intimate)
   - Primary: Contaminated water discovery beat (ominous)
   - Primary: Being watched realization beat (ominous)
   - Secondary: Dusk patrol encounter beat (desperate)
   - Secondary: Observation post zone (tense)
   - Optional: Pre-dawn departure temporal (somber)
   - Optional: Watcher's perspective (ominous)

4. **Visual Anchors:**
   - Mud and thawing earth
   - Ancient hardwood forest
   - Canopy creating "maze of shadows"
   - Stream crossings with contaminated water
   - Rocky outcrops
   - Fresh pine and damp soil scent

5. **Mood System:**
   The analysis suggests specific moods for each image type. Let me map them to the 8-mood system:
   - "tense" → likely maps to "somber" or "ominous"
   - "determined" → likely "kinetic" 
   - "desperate" → "kinetic"
   
I'll map the mood descriptors to the precise mood system. The eight moods provide a nuanced framework for capturing the emotional landscape of the Northern Road. Each mood carries a distinct emotional texture that will help define the visual storytelling of this transitional wilderness zone.

For the establishing shot, I'm focusing on the Thornwood Corridor's haunting atmosphere:
- Ominous mood dominates, suggesting dread and subtle wrongness
- Midday light filtered through dense canopy creates twilight-like conditions
- Landscape elements emphasize disorientation: mud ribbon, ancient trees forming organic walls, shadow maze

The essence shot at Windborne Roost reveals layered emotional complexity:
- Tense mood blending intimate quietness with underlying ominous threat
- Evening light suggests transitional, liminal space
- Clearing surrounded by Thornwood, smoke indicating recent human presence, warm light hinting at temporary sanctuary

Beat shots escalate narrative tension:
1. Water discovery scene: pure ominous mood
2. Watched sensation: heightened ominous atmosphere
3. Patrol encounter: kinetic urgency and desperate energy

The visual approach will require careful mood calibration to maintain narrative coherence.
