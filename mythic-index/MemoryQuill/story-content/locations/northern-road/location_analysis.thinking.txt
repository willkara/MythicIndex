I need to analyze the Northern Road location according to my role as a Location Story Analyst. This is a wilderness route location rather than a building or compound, so my analysis needs to capture:

1. The physical truth of a road/transit route
2. Its narrative soul - the threshold between safety and danger
3. Character-space relationships for those traveling it
4. Temporal states (time of day, seasons, progression along the route)
5. Contextual place in the world

Key elements from the documentation:

**Physical Truth:**
- Ribbon of mud and thawing earth (spring)
- Thornwood Forest borders creating natural corridor
- Canopy blocks sunlight creating "maze of shadows"
- Fresh pine and damp soil scents
- Contaminated waterways with suppression compounds
- Rocky outcrops, stream crossings
- Game trail alternatives through forest

**Narrative Soul:**
- Threshold between civilization and danger
- "The wilderness reveals what the city conceals"
- Silent Hand territory - contaminated wilderness
- Place where reconnaissance team faces first real danger
- Transformation from maintained road to hostile wilderness

**Zones:**
1. Southern Section (Waterdeep to Windborne Roost) - Threshold zone
2. The Windborne Roost - Sanctuary/Commons
3. Thornwood Corridor - Liminal zone
4. Northern Wilderness - Perimeter/hostile zone

**Temporal States:**
- Spring (canon season): muddy, difficult, reduced traffic
- Daily cycle: dawn movement, midday rest, dusk patrols
- Progression along route: civilization → wildness → contamination

**Character Associations:**
- Reconnaissance team (Veyra, others)
- Silent Hand patrols
- Quierk at Windborne Roost
- The "unnatural presence" that watches

**Narrative Beats:**
- ch28: Team departure, stopping at Windborne Roost, discovering contaminated water
- ch30: Forced march, being tracked/herded, dusk patrol encounter, two patrol members killed
 
I'll map out the route as a dynamic, evolving spatial experience. Each zone represents a transformative segment where characters encounter shifting environmental and narrative conditions. The road isn't just a path, but a living narrative progression from controlled civilization through increasingly hostile wilderness.
