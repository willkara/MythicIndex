narrative_soul: |
  The Northern Road is the threshold between civilization and darkness—a ribbon
  of mud and thawing earth winding north from Waterdeep through increasingly
  hostile territory. In spring, the road becomes a treacherous quagmire where
  horses struggle at every step, their hooves sucking at clinging mud.

  As the route progresses north, the Thornwood Forest closes in, ancient trees
  forming a natural corridor that funnels travelers into predictable paths—
  and into the watchful eyes of Silent Hand patrols. The air carries pine
  and damp earth, but something else lurks beneath: the sense of being
  evaluated from the shadows, the unnatural silence where wildlife should sing.

  This is where the wilderness reveals what the city conceals. The streams
  run clear but carry magical suppression compounds. The paths seem natural
  but herd travelers like sheep. Every clearing could be an observation post,
  every shadow a patrol. The Northern Road is beautiful and dangerous—
  exactly as the Silent Hand intended.

one_line_essence: "A mud-ribbon road through awakening spring, beautiful and watched, where hunters become prey."
