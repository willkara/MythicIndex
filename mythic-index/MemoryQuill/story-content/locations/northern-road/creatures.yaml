creatures:
  - name: Frost Mane
    description: Wolf-like pack predators adapted to the harsh northern climate. Their thick fur crackles with frost even in warmer weather, and their breath produces clouds of freezing vapor. They're larger and more intelligent than common wolves, with an eerie coordination that suggests supernatural awareness.
    visual_aspects:
      - Larger than dire wolves, shoulder height of 4-5 feet
      - Dense white-and-silver fur perpetually rimmed with frost crystals
      - Ice-blue eyes that reflect light like frozen pools
      - Breath creates lingering clouds of frozen vapor
      - Paw pads leave frost-marked prints that persist for minutes
    habitat:
      where: Northern stretches of the road, especially during winter and spring
      when: Most active during cold snaps and snowfall; hunt dawn and dusk
      why: Prey on deer, travelers' mounts, and anything weakened by cold
    behavior:
      who: Hunt in coordinated packs of 5-12, led by frost-scarred alpha pairs
      what: Use breath weapon to weaken prey, then overwhelm with pack tactics
      how: Supernatural coordination allows pinpoint ambushes and flanking
    lore: Northern traders claim Frost Manes can sense fear and desperation, targeting those least prepared for winter travel. Some believe they're winter spirits given flesh, not true wolves at all.

  - name: Stone Strider
    description: Humanoid constructs of living rock that blend perfectly with natural stone formations. They stand motionless for days as outcroppings, then animate to defend their territories or investigate disturbances. Their footfalls sound like grinding stone, announcing their approach.
    visual_aspects:
      - Height of 7-9 feet, bodies of weathered granite and limestone
      - Rough-hewn features barely distinguishable from natural rock face
      - Joints sealed with mineral deposits that crack when moving
      - Moss and lichen grow on their surfaces, adding to disguise
      - Eyes are deep shadow-filled depressions that glow faintly at night
    habitat:
      where: Rocky outcroppings and stone markers along the road
      when: Active when their territory is disturbed; otherwise dormant for weeks
      why: Territorial guardians of ancient sites and natural stone formations
    behavior:
      who: Solitary or in pairs bonded to specific geographic features
      what: Investigate disturbances slowly and deliberately before acting
      how: Use camouflage and patience; when roused, possess immense strength
    lore: Some Stone Striders are thousands of years old, predating the road itself. Druids say they're the mountain's immune system, protecting sacred sites from desecration.

  - name: Wind Shrike
    description: Predatory birds that have mastered wind magic through generations of evolution. They can summon localized gusts to knock prey from cliffs or horses, then dive with supernatural speed. Their cries sound like howling wind and echo unnaturally.
    visual_aspects:
      - Raptor body the size of a large eagle with elongated, blade-like wings
      - Storm-gray plumage that seems to ripple and flow like smoke
      - Eyes with spiral patterns that spin when using wind magic
      - Wingspan of 8-10 feet with feathers that whistle in flight
      - Tail feathers spread like a fan during diving attacks
    habitat:
      where: Cliff faces and tall trees overlooking the road's exposed sections
      when: Hunt during windy conditions when their abilities are strongest
      why: Prey on smaller birds, rodents, and occasionally isolated travelers
    behavior:
      who: Mated pairs that coordinate attacks with devastating precision
      what: Create wind gusts to knock prey off balance or into kill zones
      how: One bird distracts while the other attacks from an unexpected angle
    lore: Road guides warn never to wear loose clothing or carry unsecured items in Wind Shrike territory. They're drawn to fluttering fabric and will investigate, sometimes with fatal results.

  - name: Road Mimic
    description: A strange variant of the classic dungeon mimic, adapted to wilderness roads. These creatures take the form of helpful roadside objects—abandoned carts, milestone markers, or supply caches—luring desperate or curious travelers close enough to attack.
    visual_aspects:
      - Can perfectly replicate wooden structures, stone markers, or supply barrels
      - Slight oily sheen visible in bright sunlight gives them away
      - When attacking, reveals rows of sharp teeth and grasping tendrils
      - Dark flesh beneath disguise resembles aged leather
      - Size varies from small barrel to full wagon (larger mimics are older)
    habitat:
      where: Isolated sections of road where travelers are most vulnerable
      when: Position themselves before dawn, waiting motionless all day if needed
      why: Feed on travelers, pack animals, and their supplies
    behavior:
      who: Solitary ambush predators, highly patient
      what: Mimic objects that travelers would naturally investigate or use
      how: Wait for physical contact, then attack with adhesive surfaces and crushing strength
    lore: Experienced traders have a saying: "If you didn't drop it, don't trust it." Road Mimics have learned to replicate increasingly specific objects, including merchants' own supply caches.
