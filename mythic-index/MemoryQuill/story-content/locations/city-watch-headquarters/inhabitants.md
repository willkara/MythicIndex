## Operational Rhythms
- Morning (06:00–10:00):

- Midday (10:00–16:00):
  - Briefings in Shield Hall (3rd); evidence movement to Spire (-1); routine cell checks; observation deck spotters rotate; market-day surges increase public counter load.
- Evening (16:00–22:00):
  - Patrol turnover; interview rooms occupied; Bridge of Whispers used for short, informal coordination; reduced public queue; bunk/common floors reach peak occupancy.
- Night (22:00–06:00):
  - Quiet watch; reduced bridge passage; detention checks at the bells; analysis night shift thins; observation deck low-light posture.

## Notes
- Circulation priorities maintain: public flows at portal/counters, secure flows segregated via controlled stair cores and bridge portals.
- Detention safety preserves double-door sally, subgrade ventilation, and sight lines from guard posts.
- Emergency routes: Shield Hall to yard; Spire to internal stairs and controlled bridge lockouts when necessary.
