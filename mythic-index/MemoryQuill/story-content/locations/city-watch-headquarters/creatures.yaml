creatures:
  - name: Evidence Sprite
    description: Fastidious fey that organize and protect evidence in the Watch archives. They can't be bribed or fooled, maintaining perfect chain of custody. Evidence they protect never degrades, gets misfiled, or mysteriously vanishes.
    visual_aspects:
      - Humanoid figures about 8 inches tall in miniature Watch uniforms
      - Bodies shimmer between translucent and solid
      - Carry tiny ledgers and wear spectacles made from glass shards
      - Fingers leave faint glowing marks on items they've catalogued
      - Express severe disapproval through posture and tiny tsk-ing sounds
    habitat:
      where: Evidence rooms, archives, and records storage
      when: Constantly active; sleep in rotating shifts like real Watch members
      why: Manifestation of the Watch's duty to truth and justice
    behavior:
      who: Colony of 12-15 organized in strict hierarchical ranks
      what: Catalog, preserve, and protect all evidence and records
      how: Use minor preservation magic; physically prevent tampering
    lore: A corrupt inspector once tried to tamper with evidence in a noble's son's case. Evidence Sprites swarmed him, biting, until he fled. The next morning, his own past case files were laid out on the Commander's desk—with every corner he'd cut highlighted in glowing marks. He resigned before he could be fired.

  - name: Patrol Dog Spirit
    description: Ghosts of beloved Watch dogs that continue their duties after death. They patrol the headquarters at night, alert to intruders, and comfort traumatized officers. Each was a honored member of the Watch and refuses to fully move on.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent canine forms in various breeds
      - Wearing spectral versions of Watch dog equipment
      - Paws make no sound but leave cool spots on floors
      - Eyes glow with loyal amber light
      - Appear solid at a glance; transparency obvious on close inspection
    habitat:
      where: Throughout headquarters; strongest in kennels and old patrol routes
      when: Most visible at night during quiet hours
      why: Loyalty and duty extending beyond death
    behavior:
      who: Seven confirmed Patrol Dog Spirits, each with known history
      what: Alert to intruders, comfort distressed officers, maintain watch
      how: Can't physically interact but create sounds and temperature changes
    lore: Every Watch member knows their names and stories. Sergeant Loyal served fifteen years and saved three lives. When officers work late under stress, they sometimes feel a gentle cold pressure against their leg—Loyal offering comfort. New recruits aren't told about the spirits, but all eventually experience them and receive confirmation from veterans.

  - name: Truth Bell
    description: A small bronze bell that rings softly whenever someone lies within headquarters walls. Not magically infallible—it responds to intent to deceive rather than factual accuracy. It's caused more than a few confession during interrogations.
    visual_aspects:
      - Small bronze bell mounted in interview room corner
      - Covered in intricate engravings of eyes and ears
      - Produces pure, clear tone that seems to bypass ears and ring in minds
      - Tarnished with age but never silent when needed
      - Appears ordinary until it rings, then briefly glows
    habitat:
      where: Primary interrogation room; occasionally borrowed for other areas
      when: Rings spontaneously when lies are told with intent to deceive
      why: Gift from a truth deity; blessed artifact bonded to headquarters
    behavior:
      who: Inanimate object with divine enchantment
      what: Audibly marks deliberate deception
      how: Responds to speaker's intent, not factual truth
    lore: Experienced Watch members know its nuances. It doesn't ring for honest mistakes or self-deception, only deliberate lies. Clever suspects try to believe their own lies to fool it. Doesn't always work—the bell knows. One criminal made it through an entire interrogation without triggering it, then let slip a "harmless" lie as he left. The bell rang. That thread unraveled his entire alibi.

  - name: Justice Raven
    description: A supernatural raven that roosts above the headquarters and appears at crime scenes before the Watch arrives. Its presence marks locations where justice is needed. Cynics claim coincidence; veterans know better and watch for it.
    visual_aspects:
      - Larger than normal ravens with deeper black plumage
      - Eyes like polished obsidian that reflect scenes of crimes
      - Feathers shimmer with deep blue iridescence in certain light
      - Call sounds like judge's gavel striking
      - Appears solid but can vanish mid-flight
    habitat:
      where: Headquarters roost; appears at crime scenes city-wide
      when: Present at serious crimes; often arriving before first responders
      why: Unknown origin; possibly a deity's servant or manifestation of justice itself
    behavior:
      who: Single entity witnessed for over fifty years
      what: Marks crime scenes, observes investigations, occasionally guides Watch members
      how: Appears and disappears impossibly; sometimes leaves feathers at crucial evidence
    lore: A rookie once followed it through three districts to find a kidnapping victim still alive. A detective credits it with solving a decade-cold murder—a feather appeared on the one file item he'd overlooked. Skeptics exist, but most Watch members nod respectfully when it flies overhead.
