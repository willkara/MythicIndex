narrative_soul: |
  The City Watch Headquarters is a philosophical proposition rendered in
  limestone and granite—the belief that transparency and secrecy can
  serve the same justice. Shield Hall welcomes the public with heraldic
  warmth while the Spire of Inquiry holds its secrets behind dressed
  granite and narrow windows. Between them, sky-bridges span Justicar's
  Way like raised eyebrows, connecting different truths. In its
  interrogation cells, Marcus Heartbridge reveals what a skilled artist
  can do with a soul instead of canvas. In its offices, Lady Blackwater
  trades legitimacy for obligation. This is where the Last Light Company
  learns the price of becoming official: they are not partners—they are
  assets to be deployed.

one_line_essence: "Where transparency and secrecy serve the same justice across sky-bridges."
