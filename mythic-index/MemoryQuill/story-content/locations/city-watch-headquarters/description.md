# City Watch Headquarters – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Central Waterdeep along Justicar’s Way, occupying roughly one-and-a-half city blocks with a primary civic frontage onto a busy thoroughfare. Slight street crown for drainage; surrounding plots are administrative and commercial fabric of similar height.
- Site Advantages: Central access to all districts; clear street interface for public services; internal yard for controlled training and musters; proximity to records and courts.
- Environmental Factors: Seasonal rain squalls and sea winds funnel along the street; winter chill penetrates subgrade masonry; summer heat raises courtyard stone temperature.
- Approach Routes: Public approach through the main doors of the primary hall; service approaches via rear lanes and the training yard gate; official carriages stage along Justicar’s Way with bollard control.

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Waterdhavian civic-fortress vernacular—monumental ashlar façades for authority and legibility, restrained ornament at portals and coats-of-arms; robust internal partitions with warm finishes in public floors.
- Primary Materials: Limestone and granite ashlar with lime mortar; oak beams and floors in administrative levels; wrought-iron grills, hinges, and hardware; slate and lead for roofing; brick and dressed stone vaulting below grade.
- Construction Methods: Bearing masonry walls with bonded corners and string courses; arched and vaulted subgrade construction; timber joisted and trussed upper floors; iron-strapped doors to secure zones; limewash and waxed wood finishes where appropriate.
- Overall Layout: A principal civic block (Shield Hall) fronting Justicar’s Way with an enclosed rear yard; an intelligence and analysis block (Spire of Inquiry) across the street; elevated linkages between upper floors for controlled inter-building passage. Public-facing functions reside at and above street in Shield Hall; detention is below grade; analysis and secure functions concentrate in the Spire. Note: The two-building composition and sky-bridges are a Waterdeep modernization; subgrade cells beneath the public/admin headquarters and a tactical briefing room within the complex are chapter-established canon.

### Inter-Building Linkages (Over Justicar’s Way)
- Bridge of Scrutiny (3rd): Fully enclosed stone-and-iron corridor with interior shutters and privacy baffles; guarded at both portals.
- Bridge of Whispers (5th): Open-air but caged walkway with wind baffles and railings; controlled for informal coordination and observation; can be locked and sealed in foul weather.
- Engineering Notes: Masonry and iron truss underframes keyed into both buildings’ bearing walls; expansion tolerances accounted for at bearings; emergency severance plan exists (mechanical/magical) but remains sealed protocol.

### Exterior Spaces
- Yard & Courtyard (Shield Hall rear): Flagged stone surface with drainage to yard channels; weapons rack alcoves; hose bibs and sand bins; short run of galleries under the eaves.
- Street Interface: Bollards and removable crossbars at main door; lantern posts; raised plinth at portal for flood shedding.

## Physical Systems & Infrastructure

### Structural Engineering
- Foundation Systems: Spread footings under main walls; subgrade vaults act as stiffeners; Spire footings reinforced with rubble trench and bond stones; bridges bear on pilaster-buttressed wall segments.
- Load-Bearing Elements: Masonry walls and piers; timber joists and trusses over larger rooms; vaults below grade for cell block corridors.
- Roofing Systems: Slate over battens; lead/copper flashing at valleys and parapets; roof walks at Spire for observation and maintenance.
