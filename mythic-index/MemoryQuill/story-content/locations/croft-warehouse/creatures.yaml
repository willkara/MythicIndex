creatures:
  - name: Tally Finch
    description: Small birds with an uncanny ability to count. They keep perfect inventory by counting items entering and leaving the warehouse. Their chirping patterns represent numbers—experienced workers can understand their counts and catch discrepancies instantly.
    visual_aspects:
      - Sparrow-sized birds with brown and gray plumage
      - Heads constantly bobbing as they count
      - Eyes unnaturally focused and attentive
      - Chirp in precise mathematical sequences
      - Nest in rafters among carefully arranged objects
    habitat:
      where: Throughout warehouse, especially near loading areas
      when: Most active during shipments and inventory transfers
      why: Emerged from warehouse's need for accurate counting
    behavior:
      who: Flock of 10-15 birds working cooperatively
      what: Count everything entering, leaving, or being moved
      how: Chirp totals; become agitated when counts don't match records
    lore: The warehouse master trusts the Tally Finches more than written records. When a finch's count differs from paperwork, the finch is always right. They once caught a clever smuggling operation—goods being moved in shipments of "50 crates" but finches insisted on 51. The extra crate contained contraband. Now customs officials consult the birds.

  - name: Dry Rot Scout
    description: Fungal colonies with collective awareness that detect moisture, rot, and structural damage. They appear as patches of bioluminescent fungus that glow brighter near problem areas. Harmless themselves, they warn of dangerous decay.
    visual_aspects:
      - Patches of soft glowing fungus in greens and blues
      - Grow in cracks and corners throughout warehouse
      - Glow intensifies near moisture or rot
      - Create patterns pointing toward problem areas
      - Smell faintly of mushrooms and earth
    habitat:
      where: Throughout warehouse structure, especially potential problem areas
      when: Constantly present; brightness varies with detection
      why: Symbiotic relationship—warn of rot that would destroy their home
    behavior:
      who: Multiple colonies forming distributed detection network
      what: Monitor structural integrity and moisture levels
      how: Glow intensity and pattern indicates problem location and severity
    lore: Morning inspections always check the Scouts. Bright glow means investigation needed. They caught a roof leak before it damaged goods worth thousands. Workers swear they're intelligent—one colony grew in arrow pattern pointing directly to hidden termite damage. "They're looking out for us," the warehouse master says, leaving water and nutrients for the colonies.

  - name: Shadow Stacker
    description: Animated shadows that help organize cargo during night hours. They don't move physical objects but create shadow guides showing optimal stacking arrangements. Following their patterns results in perfectly stable, space-efficient loads.
    visual_aspects:
      - Dark shadows that don't match any physical object
      - Move independently of light sources
      - Form shapes suggesting stacking patterns and arrangements
      - Create template-like guides on floors and walls
      - Darker than natural shadows, almost tangibly black
    habitat:
      where: Throughout warehouse storage areas
      when: Most active during night hours when warehouse is closed
      why: Manifestation of perfect organization principles
    behavior:
      who: Multiple shadows or single entity appearing throughout space
      what: Show optimal cargo arrangement patterns
      how: Create visual templates that maximize space and stability
    lore: Night shift workers rely on them completely. "Just stack where the shadows show" is standard training. Loads arranged by Shadow Stackers never collapse and use every inch of space. One skeptical foreman ignored them and arranged his own way—half his load fell during transport. He follows the shadows now.

  - name: Warding Mouse
    description: Unusually large, intelligent mice that patrol the warehouse hunting other vermin. They seem to understand property boundaries and defend stored goods viciously. Unlike normal mice, they're welcomed by the staff and fed regularly.
    visual_aspects:
      - Size of small cats with thick, healthy fur
      - Unusually bright, intelligent eyes
      - Move with purpose, not rodent skittishness
      - Wear tiny collars with small bells—so staff know they're friendlies
      - Groom themselves fastidiously; never appear diseased
    habitat:
      where: Throughout warehouse, patrolling regular routes
      when: Most active at night but visible during day
      why: Magically enhanced rodents serving as pest control
    behavior:
      who: Pack of 6-8 working cooperatively
      what: Hunt and eliminate warehouse pests; guard against contamination
      how: Coordinate like military patrol; drive invaders out systematically
    lore: They appeared five years ago and eliminated a plague rat infestation in two weeks. Staff named each one and built them a comfortable den with heating. They're so effective that the warehouse has zero pest damage—something unheard of in Waterdeep. One tried to chase off a thief once, causing enough noise to alert guards. They're considered employees now, with official rations and occasional treats.
