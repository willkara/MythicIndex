narrative_soul: |
  Croft Warehouse is corruption made architectural—a respectable dock
  facade concealing weapons trafficking and Silent Hand supply chains.
  Behind a hideous battle tapestry, a safe holds ledgers of crimes that
  could bring down the merchant who runs it. When Veyra goes shoulder-
  first through a window with those pages, and when the "controlled"
  fire burns everything except the military-grade weapons, the building
  reveals its two truths: the commerce it pretends to be, and the war
  materiel it actually moves. This is where the Company learns that
  corruption burns its evidence while protecting its true trade.

one_line_essence: "Where corruption hides behind commerce, and fire reveals what matters."
