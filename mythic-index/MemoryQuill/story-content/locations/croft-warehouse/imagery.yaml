  visual_description: "A mid-sized commercial warehouse in Stonebridge's merchant district, timber-framed with stone foundation, appearing respectable and well-maintained. Merchant's sign displays 'S. Croft - Quality Grains' in brass letters. High windows suggest ventilation, loading dock visible at side. The structure exudes prosperous orderliness, masking the fraud within."
  composition_notes: "Wide shot from street level, slightly elevated perspective, warehouse centered with merchant district context visible, late afternoon light casting long shadows"
  narrative_significance: "This is where Veyra's team confronts merchant corruption - a facade of legitimacy hiding fraudulent operations"

    visual_description: "Rows of shelving and crates stretch into shadow, goods organized by type with deceptive precision. Quality grain sacks sit alongside inferior stock, weights and measures nearby. Clear aisles for workers suggest legitimate operations, but subtle inconsistencies hint at manipulation. Mountains of crates and barrels create a labyrinthine interior. Dust hangs in air, catching filtered light from high windows."

Quill and inkwell suggest recent work. Window overlooks loading dock. Oil lamp provides warm light. The space appears orderly and professional, but careful examination reveals inconsistencies in the ledgers - the evidence Veyra seeks."

Her silhouette is framed against the dim rectangle of hatch light from above, descending into absolute blackness. Dust rises from grain sacks where she'll land, caught in the faint shaft of light. The warehouse below is a vast darkness filled with shadowy mountains of crates and barrels. The composition emphasizes vulnerability and commitment - the point of no return."

    visual_description: "Glass explodes outward in frozen cascade as Veyra bursts shoulder-first through the office window. Shards suspend in air like frozen rain, catching harsh backlighting from the office interior. Her silhouette is mid-trajectory, body committed to the desperate leap toward the dark dock below. The composition captures the explosive instant - glass radiating outward from impact point, Veyra's determined form at center, void of dock beyond beckoning. Shouts erupt from warehouse behind her (just out of frame)."
    composition_notes: "Landscape orientation with diagonal explosive composition. Veyra center-left moving right toward dock, glass fragments radiating outward in dynamic pattern. Harsh backlight from office creates dramatic rim on glass shards. Dark dock below emphasizes danger of fall. Freeze-frame dynamic composition."
    narrative_significance: "The moment subtlety ends and survival begins - Veyra chooses explosive escape over capture with evidence"
