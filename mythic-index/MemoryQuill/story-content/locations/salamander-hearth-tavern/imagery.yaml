            SCENARIO: three moon-elf musicians in corner alcove, fiddles/viols as primary instruments, silver-pale elven features catching amber tavern light, long elegant fingers on strings, corner position with slight separation from main room, blurred warm shapes of patrons visible behind, concentration and elven grace in posture, low blackened ceiling beams painted amber by oil-lantern light, central stone hearth with active fire as commanding focal point, oil-lanterns in wall and beam brackets casting warm pools, moon-elf fiddler trio in corner alcove, working-class timber-frame construction, well-worn but maintained, the 'honey on old wood' amber glow that defines the atmosphere, hearthstones with faint heat-runes that keep fire steady through storms, a mix of patrons beyond humans (dwarves, elves, tieflings) in the warm crowd, Three moon-elves in their corner alcove, intent upon their fiddles. The amber tavern light catches silver-pale features and long elegant fingers on strings—otherworldly grace amid rough timber and smoky air. Their corner is slightly set apart, perhaps a raised step or alcove that gives them stage presence while remaining part of the room's fabric. Behind them, the warm blur of patrons—the human world they play for. The elves seem both present and apart, their stillness and concentration a counterpoint to the animated discussion around them. Instruments glow with warm wood tones. Their music is visible in posture and focus—the bend of a bow, the tilt of a head, the closed eyes of one lost in melody., Faerûn high-fantasy interior cues (subtle, believable magic): enchanted lanterns/sconces, rune-inlaid beams, warding motifs worked into stone and metal, arcane guild seals and sigils as functional infrastructure, Narrative context: The fiddlers provide the sonic texture that elevates tavern conversation to something more. They represent beauty in unexpected places—elven elegance choosing to grace a working-class establishment. They witness human rituals without quite participating., Medium shot focused on the trio. Corner framing gives them their own space while tavern context remains visible. Warm lamp light from above or side catches elven features against darker corner. Fiddles prominent in frame—the instruments matter. Background shows blurred warmth of the common room, patrons as soft shapes in amber light. The three arranged in classic musical trio composition—perhaps one slightly forward, two behind., evening, n/a (interior focus), light from oil-lantern in or near their corner, soft amber with slightly luminous quality on elven skin, from above-side, catching features and instruments, warm amber with hint of silver on skin tones, medium, softer than main room shadows, slight haze creating dreamy quality, dominant colors: silver-pale skin, amber light warmth, dark timber corner, warm fiddle wood; accent colors: pale hair (silver, pale gold, or midnight), simple but fine cloth, catgut string glint, high fantasy, ethereal atmosphere, materials: timber frame with exposed beams, smoke-blackened over years, stone or brick construction, substantial and central, brass or iron oil-lantern brackets, glass chimneys, Mood intent: The moon-elf fiddlers represent otherworldly beauty in working-class surroundings—the Pre-Raphaelite luminous quality captures their elven nature while the amber surroundings ground them in the tavern's earthiness.

Rain falls steady through the darkness, slicking cobblestones that reflect the amber glow from the tavern's windows. The building itself is traditional Dock Ward timber-frame—nothing grand, one of many along this working waterfront. But tonight it glows. Windows spill warm light into the mist, rectangles of honey-amber against the dark wet night. A sign or relief—perhaps a salamander curled near flames—identifies the establishment. The harbor district stretches dark behind and around—mast lights in the distance, wet rooftops, the smell of salt and rain. Perhaps a figure approaches the door, silhouetted against the warm rectangle about to open. This is what sailors see after long voyages: the promise of warmth., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: This establishes the tavern as REFUGE—its meaning depends on what's outside it. The rain creates the contrast that makes the hearth precious. This is the Dock Ward context, the working waterfront where the Salamander's Hearth serves its community., Medium-wide exterior shot from street level. The tavern occupies center-right, its glowing windows the focal point. Rain visible against the light—streaks and drops catching the glow. Wet cobblestones in foreground creating reflections. Dark surroundings frame the warm building. Perhaps a figure approaching adds narrative tension—about to cross from cold to warm. Harbor district context visible: distant masts, neighboring buildings in darkness., evening, steady rain, mist, wet, light from amber light from tavern windows, warm glow against cold wet darkness, light spilling outward from building, amber warm inside, blue-gray cold outside tones, deep—darkness surrounds the beacon shadows, rain and mist diffusing the light, dominant colors: amber window glow, rain-dark gray, wet black cobblestone, mist white; accent colors: distant harbor light, reflection amber on wet stone, dark timber facade, high fantasy, somber atmosphere, materials: timber frame with exposed beams, smoke-blackened over years, stone or brick construction, substantial and central, brass or iron oil-lantern brackets, glass chimneys, Mood intent: The rain and dark create melancholy weight—the viewer feels the wet chill, which makes the amber windows all the more inviting. The contrast IS the meaning: refuge against the world's harshness.

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            - character portraits (identity references)

            - a location overview (environment reference)

            - style references (art direction)


            Generate a NEW scene matching the scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Avoid “real-world medieval Europe” drift; keep fantasy species variety and magical infrastructure plausible and grounded-in-world (not neon).

            5. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.

Slightly blurred or softened edges suggesting eyes adjusting from dark to light, wet to warm. The hearth commands center distance. Lanterns glow overhead on blackened beams.

            SCENARIO: central stone hearth with active fire, commanding position, low blackened ceiling beams overhead, oil-lanterns creating amber pools of light on beams, moon-elf fiddler trio visible in corner, half-full crowd of working-class patrons at tables, threshold transition visible at frame edge, the 'honey on old wood' amber glow throughout, low blackened ceiling beams painted amber by oil-lantern light, central stone hearth with active fire as commanding focal point, oil-lanterns in wall and beam brackets casting warm pools, moon-elf fiddler trio in corner alcove, working-class timber-frame construction, well-worn but maintained, the 'honey on old wood' amber glow that defines the atmosphere, hearthstones with faint heat-runes that keep fire steady through storms, a mix of patrons beyond humans (dwarves, elves, tieflings) in the warm crowd, POV from a cozy window seat or booth next to a leaded glass window. Rain lashes against the glass, blurring the dark blue/grey world outside. On the glass, the reflection of the warm, amber tavern interior is visible—firelight, happy figures. A hot mug sits on the sill in the foreground. The barrier between cold and warm is thin but absolute., Faerûn high-fantasy interior cues (subtle, believable magic): enchanted lanterns/sconces, rune-inlaid beams, warding motifs worked into stone and metal, arcane guild seals and sigils as functional infrastructure, Narrative context: Reinforces the theme of refuge. The world is cold; the Salamander is warm., Framing through the window. Rain texture on glass. Reflection layering. Mug as anchor., night/storm, light from interior reflection, soft, reflective, dominant colors: storm blue/grey, amber reflection, glass tint; accent colors: silver-pale (moon-elf figures), salt-stained canvas grays, copper and brass glints, high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: timber frame with exposed beams, smoke-blackened over years, stone or brick construction, substantial and central, brass or iron oil-lantern brackets, glass chimneys, Mood intent: The feeling of being sheltered. Contrast between the storm outside and the warmth inside.

            , high-fantasy interior architecture, wide establishing composition, enchanted lanternlight and arcane glow, subtle runes and warding motifs, intricate craftsmanship, detailed stone/wood/metal textures, storytelling composition, Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.
