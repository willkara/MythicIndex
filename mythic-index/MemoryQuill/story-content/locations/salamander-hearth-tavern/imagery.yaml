narrative_soul: |
  The Salamander's Hearth is where stories become legends—a half-full Dock
  Ward tavern where oil-lanterns paint ceiling beams amber "like honey on
  old wood" and moon-elf fiddlers play in the corner while sailors, caravan
  guards, and off-duty watchmen debate philosophy and process extraordinary
  events.

  At the heart of the space sits the commanding hearth that gives the
  establishment its name—a gathering point where working folk raise tankards
  to fallen heroes and whisper prayers for souls they never knew. Unlike
  rougher waterfront establishments, the Salamander's Hearth has a reverent
  quality, a contemplative warmth where legend-making happens in real time.

  When the courier bursts through the door with news—"She's awake, the
  Ash-Marked"—this is where the city's response takes shape, where hope
  crystallizes in collective toasts and skeptics like Gillthorn voice the
  counterpoint that makes belief meaningful.

one_line_essence: "Amber-lit hearth-warmth where working folk transform stories into legends."
