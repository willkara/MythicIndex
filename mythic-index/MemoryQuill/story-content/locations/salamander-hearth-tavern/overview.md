- **Significance Level**: Minor (community gathering point)

## Quick Description
A half-full Dock Ward tavern where oil-lanterns paint ceiling beams amber "like honey on old wood," centered around a prominent hearth that gives the establishment its name. A trio of moon-elf fiddlers plays in the corner while sailors, caravan guards, and off-duty watchmen gather to share stories, debate philosophy, and process the extraordinary events shaping their city.

## Visual Summary

- **Recurring Location**: No (single appearance)
- **Key Events**: Detailed discussion of Veyra Thornwake's Canyon Incident survival; community legend-building

## Clientele & Atmosphere
