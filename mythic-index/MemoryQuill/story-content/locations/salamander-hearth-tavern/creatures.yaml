creatures:
  - name: Hearthfire Salamander
    description: The tavern's namesake and guardian. A genuine fire salamander that lives in the central hearth, growing fat on the warmth and good cheer. It's considered extraordinary good luck, and the tavern's prosperity is directly tied to its presence.
    visual_aspects:
      - Lizard-like body about 2 feet long with glowing orange-red scales
      - Scales pulse brighter when the tavern is full of laughter
      - Eyes like smoldering coals that reflect firelight
      - Leaves warm footprints that glow briefly on hearthstones
      - Occasionally visible basking on the mantle during peak hours
    habitat:
      where: The central hearth and chimney system
      when: Most visible during busy evenings when fires are hottest
      why: Feeds on ambient warmth and positive emotions
    behavior:
      who: Single individual that's lived here for decades
      what: Emerges to bask during celebrations; retreats during arguments
      how: Maintains hearth efficiency; fires burn cleaner and warmer with its presence
    lore: The proprietor claims his grandfather won the salamander in a card game with a djinn. When the creature is happy, drinks taste better and arguments resolve peacefully. When troubled patrons arrive, it emerges to warm itself, and somehow they leave feeling comforted.

  - name: Story Mote
    description: Luminous particles that float in the smoky air, drawn to good stories and strong emotions. They cluster around particularly moving tales, creating halos around skilled storytellers. Some claim they're fragments of bardic magic made manifest.
    visual_aspects:
      - Tiny points of amber light floating in the smoky air
      - Drift like lazy fireflies but move toward emotional moments
      - Cluster in clouds around storytellers, musicians, and debaters
      - Pulse in rhythm with music and laughter
      - Leave faint trails like golden thread in the air
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the common room, especially near the hearth and musician's corner
      when: Appear during peak evening hours; fade when the tavern empties
      why: Feed on emotional energy and creative expression
    behavior:
      who: Countless individual motes forming collective patterns
      what: Gather around compelling stories, beautiful music, honest emotion
      how: Create visual feedback for storytellers—more motes mean better performance
    lore: Regulars judge a tale's quality by how many Story Motes it attracts. A truly legendary telling creates a golden cloud that lingers for days. The night they discussed Veyra Thornwake's survival, the entire tavern glowed like a second sun.

  - name: Ale Sprite
    description: Mischievous tiny fey that live in ale barrels and fermentation equipment. They improve the quality of the brew but demand respect and regular offerings. Cross them and every barrel turns to vinegar overnight.
    visual_aspects:
      - No larger than a thumb, with bodies that shift between liquid and solid
      - Skin the color of different ales—amber, gold, dark brown
      - Foam-like hair that fizzes and bubbles
      - Tiny wings that look like hop flowers
      - Leave droplets of perfectly aged ale wherever they touch
    habitat:
      where: Ale barrels, fermentation vats, and tap systems
      when: Active during brewing and serving hours
      why: Feed on yeast and grain; improve fermentation through magical presence
    behavior:
      who: Small family group of 4-6 sprites per establishment
      what: Enhance brewing process; occasionally spike drinks with extra potency
      how: Swim through liquid, adjusting flavor and alcohol content by presence
    lore: The master brewer leaves a thimble of cream and honey out every night without fail. Once a new server dumped old ale down the drain without the proper blessing—every drink she poured for a month tasted faintly of soap.

  - name: Shadowear
    description: A cat-sized creature of living shadow that dwells in the ceiling beams above the hearth. It absorbs conversations and replays them as ambient whispers—confessions, prophecies, jokes, and lies all tangled together. Called the "Tavern's Conscience," it can't distinguish truth from fabrication, creating an eerie archive of memory and rumor.
    visual_aspects:
      - Feline-shaped shadow with substance but no true form
      - Size of a large cat but seems to shift slightly larger in darkness
      - Two gleaming eyes like distant stars visible in its silhouette
      - Moves along walls and ceilings like flowing ink
      - Tendrils of shadow extend like listening ears toward conversations
      - Occasionally reveals mouth when "speaking"—a darker void within shadow
    habitat:
      where: Ceiling beam shadows and dark corners above the central hearth
      when: Most active during busy evenings; dormant during quiet mornings
      why: Feeds on emotional resonance of human speech and memory
    behavior:
      who: Single individual entity; the proprietor's family "won" it in a card game with a djinn
      what: Absorbs nearby conversations; replays fragments as ambient whispers
      how: Whispers emerge from shadows randomly—sometimes prophetic, sometimes nonsense
    lore: Regulars know to listen for their own words echoing back weeks later, sometimes revealing truths they didn't know they'd spoken. Once, a merchant's lie about prices was replayed three nights running until he confessed. Another time, a wanderer's half-remembered prophecy emerged clearly, saving the town from flood.
