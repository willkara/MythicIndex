  location_type: "building"
  
  narrative_soul: |
    The Salamander's Hearth is where heroes become legends in the mouths of common people. It's not where deeds happen—it's where deeds are *remembered*, debated, and sanctified by the ordinary folk who benefit from them. This is the forge of reputation, where working hands lift cups in toast and skeptics test miracle stories against hard-won common sense.
    
  one_line_essence: "Where common folk transform deeds into legend"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "The hearth as communal processing of the extraordinary"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Warmth against the rain (shelter from dangerous world)"
      - "Amber light on old wood (preservation of memory)"
      - "Moon-elf music (beauty in humble places)"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "Skepticism vs. reverence"
      - "Ordinary patrons discussing extraordinary events"
      - "Individual heroism validated by collective witness"

  transformation_arc: |
    The tavern itself doesn't transform—it serves as a fixed point where transformation happens TO the Company's reputation. In this single scene, Veyra Thornwake's ordeal passes from rumor to accepted truth to toast-worthy legend. The Hearth witnesses the alchemy of hero-making.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Traditional Dock Ward timber-frame tavern"
  primary_materials:
    - "Timber frame with exposed ceiling beams"
    - "Blackened/aged wood (smoke-darkened over years)"
    - "Oil-lanterns in wall/beam brackets"
    - "Stone or brick hearth (implied by name)"
  scale_impression: "Moderate capacity; intimate enough for shared conversation, large enough for a crowd"
  
  visual_signature: |
    The defining image is the ceiling—low blackened beams painted amber by oil-lantern light "like honey on old wood." This golden glow pools in warm islands around the room, with the hearth adding dancing firelight. The effect is both humble and beautiful, working-class materials transformed by light into something almost sacred.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Moon-elf fiddle music threads through the room—not foreground entertainment but ambient texture. Beneath it: murmured conversation punctuated by emphatic declarations, the occasional collective hush before a toast, and the quiet acknowledgment of shared prayer.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Wood smoke from the hearth, lamp oil, ale and simple food, the salt-and-tar undertone of Dock Ward workers. Possibly pipe tobacco. The warm smell of people gathered together.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Warmth radiating from the hearth against the chill of rainy evening outside. Worn smooth wood of tables and chairs. The close press of bodies in a half-full room. Moisture on windows from the contrast of warm interior and cold rain.

  light_character: |
    Warm amber dominates—oil-lanterns create pools of golden light, the hearth adds flickering warmth and dancing shadows. The "honey on old wood" quality suggests diffusion through slightly smoky air. No harsh edges; everything softened and aged by the glow. Dark corners exist but feel protective rather than threatening.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Rain outside during the witnessed scene creates crucial contrast—the tavern becomes refuge, a dry warm pocket against the wet harbor night. Windows likely show rain streaks; entering patrons bring dampness with them before the hearth warms them.
