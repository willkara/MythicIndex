creatures:
  - name: Shadow Stag
    description: Majestic deer-like creatures that exist partially in shadow. Their forms seem to flicker between solid and insubstantial, and they leave no tracks. Once noble guardians of the forest, they've become corrupted by the Silent Hand's presence, serving as unwilling sentinels and trackers.
    visual_aspects:
      - Large stag form with antlers that seem to absorb light
      - Body transitions between solid black and translucent shadow
      - Eyes glow with sickly green phosphorescence
      - Movement creates ripples in surrounding darkness
      - No hoofprints; instead leaves patches of deepened shadow
    habitat:
      where: Deep forest near Silent Hand territory; drawn to corrupted areas
      when: Active in twilight and full darkness; pain-sensitive to bright light
      why: Corrupted by magical contamination; bound to patrol certain routes
    behavior:
      who: Once solitary and peaceful; now unwilling servants of Silent Hand magic
      what: Track intruders through shadow-sense; report to handlers via magical link
      how: Move silently through shadows, observing rather than attacking directly
    lore: Rangers speak of a time when Shadow Stags were protective forest spirits. Their corruption is considered a crime against nature itself. Some still hope they can be freed from the Silent Hand's influence.

  - name: Canopy Lurker
    description: Ambush predators that blend perfectly with tree bark and branches. They have chameleon-like skin and can remain motionless for hours. Unlike natural predators, these seem unnaturally focused on humanoid prey, suggesting they've learned to hunt people specifically.
    visual_aspects:
      - Serpentine body 12-15 feet long with four grasping limbs
      - Skin perfectly mimics bark texture and coloration
      - Broad, flat head with independently moving eyes
      - Prehensile tail for anchoring to branches
      - When moving, ripples of color change race across body
    habitat:
      where: Forest canopy along game trails and patrol routes
      when: Most dangerous during travel hours when prey is moving below
      why: Ambush predator targeting larger prey, including humans
    behavior:
      who: Solitary hunters with large territories
      what: Drop from above to constrict and suffocate prey
      how: Use perfect camouflage and patience; strike only when prey is directly beneath
    lore: Some believe Canopy Lurkers were normal tree serpents that learned to hunt humans by watching Silent Hand patrols. They've adapted their hunting patterns to humanoid behavior.

  - name: Whisper Bat
    description: Colonies of small bats with an unsettling ability to mimic sounds, including human speech. They repeat words and phrases they've heard, creating eerie echoes in the forest. Near Silent Hand operations, they've learned to repeat patrol codes and prisoner pleas.
    visual_aspects:
      - Tiny bodies no larger than a mouse with disproportionately large ears
      - Pale, almost translucent wing membranes
      - Faces vaguely humanoid with expressive features
      - Colonies create shifting, swirling masses in twilight
      - Glow faintly with bioluminescence when vocalizing
    habitat:
      where: Hollow trees and caves; drawn to areas of frequent human activity
      when: Most vocal at dusk and dawn, creating chorus of repeated sounds
      why: Use mimicry to confuse prey insects and communicate within colony
    behavior:
      who: Live in colonies of hundreds; individual intelligence is low but collective effect is unnerving
      what: Repeat sounds heard within last several days with perfect accuracy
      how: Create layered echoes that can disorient travelers and mask real sounds
    lore: Near the Silent Hand facility, Whisper Bats have become harbingers of horror, repeating screams, pleas, and cold commands from the facility. Experienced scouts use them to gather intelligence, carefully listening to what they repeat.

  - name: Corruption Treant
    description: Ancient tree-beings twisted by exposure to the Silent Hand's magical suppression compounds. Once wise protectors, they've become hostile and confused, attacking anything that moves through their territory. Their wood weeps with contaminated sap.
    visual_aspects:
      - Towering forms 20-30 feet tall of diseased, gnarled wood
      - Bark cracked and oozing sickly amber sap
      - Branch-arms end in splintered, claw-like projections
      - Hollow eyes glow with the same green light as contaminated water
      - Leaves are withered and discolored, some show necrotic patterns
    habitat:
      where: Areas with contaminated groundwater near the facility
      when: Active year-round, increasingly aggressive as contamination worsens
      why: Slowly dying from magical poisoning; lash out in pain and confusion
    behavior:
      who: Tragic individuals suffering from environmental corruption
      what: Attack anything entering their territory, unable to distinguish threat from friend
      how: Use massive strength and reach; contaminated sap burns exposed skin
    lore: Druids weep when speaking of the Corruption Treants. Each was once a named guardian with centuries of wisdom. The Silent Hand's pollution has condemned them to a slow, agonizing death—and they don't even understand what's happening to them.
