narrative_soul: |
  The Northern Sword Coast Wilderness is a realm of ancient trees and deep
  shadows—a place where the natural beauty of the world feels both profound
  and perilous. This is old-growth forest unchanged for millennia, where
  massive trees create a cathedral of green and shadow, and crystal-clear
  streams cut through rocky terrain.

  But something is wrong. The deeper one travels, the more the wrongness
  manifests. Normal wildlife patterns are disrupted. Birdsong falls silent.
  An unnatural presence tracks travelers through the shadows. The forest
  is at war with itself—pristine nature being subtly poisoned by a creeping,
  unseen corruption emanating from the Silent Hand facility to the north.

  This is the gradient between healthy wilderness and weaponized landscape—
  where the reconnaissance team must travel to reach their target, and where
  the beauty of the ancient forest serves as both blessing and warning.
