# Northern Sword Coast Wilderness - Physical Description

## Master Description
The Northern Sword Coast Wilderness is a realm of ancient trees and deep shadows, a place where the natural beauty of the world feels both profound and perilous. Sunlight struggles to pierce the dense canopy, creating a mosaic of light and gloom on the forest floor. The air is thick with the scent of pine, damp earth, and the clean, cold rush of crystal-clear streams. However, a subtle wrongness pervades the deeper woods—an unnatural silence where birdsong should be, a flicker of movement in the periphery that is not of any normal beast. It is a landscape at war with itself, where pristine nature is being subtly poisoned by a creeping, unseen corruption.

## Geography/Layout
-   **Size/Scale**: A vast expanse of dense, old-growth forest, covering many square miles.
-   **Terrain/Structure**: The terrain is a mix of rolling hills, dense forest, and rocky outcrops. Ancient trees form natural corridors and blockades. Fast-flowing streams cut through the landscape, creating natural borders and obstacles.
-   **Districts/Areas**:
    *   **The Old Forest**: The dominant feature, a forest of massive, ancient trees whose canopy creates a perpetual twilight. The forest floor is a labyrinth of roots, moss, and fallen leaves.
    *   **The Rushwater Streams**: A network of cold, clear streams that are both a source of life and a challenge to cross. Their banks are often rocky and slick.
    *   **The Stone Fangs**: Jagged outcrops of rock and small cliffs that provide natural shelter and defensive positions, but also ideal ambush locations.
    *   **The Corrupted Zones**: Areas closer to the Silent Hand facility where the natural world is visibly tainted. Here, the vegetation is twisted, the water has an oily sheen, and the wildlife is either absent or unnaturally aggressive.
-   **Layout Pattern**: Organic and chaotic, shaped by millennia of natural growth and geological activity.

## Sensory Details
-   **Visual**:
    *   *Day*: Shafts of light piercing the gloom. The deep greens and browns of the forest. The flash of silver from the streams. The unsettling sight of unnaturally colored moss or twisted branches in the corrupted zones.
    *   *Night*: Almost total darkness under the canopy, broken only by moonlight in the clearings. The faint, predatory gleam of unnatural eyes in the shadows.
-   **Sounds**:
    *   *Ambient Noises*: The sigh of wind through the high branches, the rush of water, the snap of a twig underfoot. A notable lack of normal animal sounds in many areas.
-   **Smells**:
    *   *Dominant Scents*: Pine needles, damp earth, wet stone. In the corrupted zones, a faint, acrid, chemical smell that clashes with the natural scents.
-   **Atmosphere/Feeling**:
    *   *First Impression*: Awe-inspiring and intimidating. A sense of being in a wild, untamed place that is much older than civilization. This gives way to a growing sense of unease and dread as the signs of corruption become more apparent.
