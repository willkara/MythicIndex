This is a comprehensive request to create location imagery specifications for "The Spire of Learning" - an academic campus in Waterdeep's Castle Ward. Let me analyze what I've been given:

**From the Analysis:**
- Academic campus with distinctive morning marble glare
- Key zones: Main Gates, Processional Forecourt, Main Hall Concourse, Grand Amphitheater (300 seats), Faculty Meeting Rooms, Colonnades/Terraces, Scholar's Quad, Service Corridor
- Narrative soul: "Where knowledge becomes visible" - the morning glare as literal manifestation of enlightenment
- Key characters: Professor Aldara Stoneforge, Master Cordelia Brightwater, Scholar Miriam Goldspring
- Story beats: ch23.5 (faculty evening discussions), ch25-26 (amphitheater events)

**Canon Details to Maintain:**
- Pale marble with high albedo producing strong morning glare (FIRM)
- Grand amphitheater seating ~300 in raked tiers (FIRM)
- Heavy doors with sound seals at amphitheater (FIRM)
- Carefully manicured grounds (FIRM)
- Diagram rails behind amphitheater podium (FIRM)
- Bronze-bound oak doors
- Covered colonnades and terrace walks

**Recommended Images from Analysis:**
1. ESTABLISHING: Morning approach with marble glare (PRIMARY)
2. ZONE: Grand Amphitheater interior during assembly (PRIMARY)
3. INHABITED: Faculty meeting room evening discussion (SECONDARY)
4. TEMPORAL: Evening campus with warm lamp pools (SECONDARY)
5. ESSENCE: Scholar's Quad with surrounding façades (SECONDARY)
6. PERSPECTIVE: View through arcade colonnade (OPTIONAL)

**Visual Anchor Elements:**
- High-albedo pale marble
- Bronze hardware and lamp standards
- Oak interiors (conference tables, wainscoting, trusses)


- Granite podium foundations
- Stone-paved arcades
- Clerestory illumination
- Rhythmic architectural lines

I'm exploring the mood nuances of the morning approach, carefully considering the light's ethereal and kinetic qualities. The blinding marble glare suggests a complex atmospheric experience that defies simple categorization.

For the amphitheater, I'm drawn to the Somber mood, reflecting the profound weight of collective intellectual presence. The evening faculty scene feels distinctly intimate, with concentrated lamplight creating a focused environment.

The campus evening mood seems to hover between Pastoral and another undefined state, suggesting a transitional atmospheric quality.

I'll carefully construct the imagery file, mindful of the character representation constraints. The challenge involves capturing scene essences without specific character details, requiring generic yet evocative descriptions.

The Scholar's Quad and Arcade perspectives both resonate with a Pastoral sensibility - open, breathing spaces with diffuse light and a sense of expansive calm.

My approach will prioritize precise YAML structure while navigating the limitations of character source files.

I'll focus on generic character descriptions aligned with their narrative roles, using aspect ratios that enhance the scene's emotional and spatial qualities. The key will be creating a framework flexible enough to accommodate future character-specific imagery.
