creatures:
  - name: Chalk Phantom
    description: Animated chalk dust that coalesces into temporary teaching assistants. They draw diagrams, write formulas, and correct student errors on chalkboards overnight. Manifestations of countless lectures absorbed by the building itself.
    visual_aspects:
      - Clouds of white or colored chalk dust forming hand-like shapes
      - Sometimes coalesce into partial humanoid figures at chalkboards
      - Leave trails of perfect lettering and precise diagrams
      - Multiple colors swirl when explaining complex concepts
      - Dissipate when disturbed but reform when observed calmly
    habitat:
      where: Lecture halls and classrooms with chalkboards
      when: Most active late at night and early morning before classes
      why: Manifestation of educational intent and accumulated knowledge
    behavior:
      who: Multiple entities or possibly one distributed consciousness
      what: Complete unfinished lessons, correct errors, illustrate concepts
      how: Manipulate chalk dust with precision exceeding human capability
    lore: Students who study late sometimes find their confusion addressed—diagrams appear on boards clarifying exactly what they struggled with. Skeptical professors claimed confirmation bias until they left deliberately incorrect equations on boards. Every error was corrected by morning, with additional proof steps included.

  - name: Question Mouse
    description: Small rodents that collect questions like other mice collect food. They steal papers with question marks, gather around students asking questions aloud, and seem to connect questioners with answerers through mysterious intuition.
    visual_aspects:
      - Slightly smaller than normal mice with unusually large, expressive eyes
      - Whiskers twitch when questions are asked nearby
      - Carry paper scraps with question marks in their mouths
      - Fur ranges from dark gray to brown, always well-groomed
      - Ears swivel toward questioners like tiny radar dishes
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the Spire, especially libraries and study areas
      when: Active during study hours; drawn to confusion and inquiry
      why: Feed on the energy of questions and the satisfaction of answers
    behavior:
      who: Colony of 30-40 living throughout the building
      what: Appear near students struggling with questions
      how: Create "coincidences" connecting those with questions to those with answers
    lore: Students learn to pay attention when Question Mice appear. If one runs from your study area to a specific bookshelf, that section probably has your answer. If it runs to another student, they might help. A thesis student followed a Question Mouse for ten minutes through the Spire and found it stopped at a visiting scholar who happened to be the world expert on his exact research question.

  - name: Echo Lecturer
    description: Ghostly repetitions of particularly passionate or important lectures that replay in empty classrooms. Not true ghosts but magical recordings triggered by similar topics or on anniversary dates. They fade with time unless refreshed by new passionate teaching.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent figures of professors in lecture poses
      - Voices audible but muffled, as if through walls
      - Gestures repeat exactly, like looped recordings
      - Appear in period-appropriate academic robes from various eras
      - Chalk appears on boards in sync with ghost lectures
    habitat:
      where: Older lecture halls with long teaching histories
      when: Triggered by similar topics or historical anniversaries
      why: Powerful magical imprint from emotionally intense teaching moments
    behavior:
      who: Dozens of recorded lectures from Spire's history
      what: Replay important lectures and breakthrough moments
      how: Some respond to student presence, others play on fixed schedules
    lore: The famous "Breakthrough Lecture" on planar theory replays every year on the anniversary—the moment a professor solved a centuries-old problem in real-time during class. Advanced students attend deliberately to witness genius in action, even if it's only a ghost of it.

  - name: Insight Owl
    description: A spectral owl that roosts in the Spire's highest tower and appears to students on the verge of breakthrough understanding. Its presence signals that comprehension is near—those who see it and persist usually achieve their learning goal within hours.
    visual_aspects:
      - Large owl with faintly luminous white-and-silver plumage
      - Eyes that seem to reflect inner understanding rather than light
      - Wings make no sound in flight
      - Appears solid until it passes through walls
      - Leaves single white feathers that fade after a few hours
    habitat:
      where: Highest tower roost; appears throughout Spire during visits
      when: Manifests to students experiencing pre-breakthrough struggle
      why: Unknown; possibly a familiar of the Spire's founder, now serving all students
    behavior:
      who: Single entity witnessed consistently for over a century
      what: Appears to struggling students near breakthrough moments
      how: Presence alone seems to calm minds and enhance focus
    lore: "If you see the Insight Owl, don't stop." That's the saying among students. Its appearance means you're close to understanding—giving up then would waste the opportunity. A student who saw it during his comprehensive exams credits it with his success: "It perched on my desk and stared. I was terrified at first, then calm. I looked at the problem again and suddenly everything made sense."
