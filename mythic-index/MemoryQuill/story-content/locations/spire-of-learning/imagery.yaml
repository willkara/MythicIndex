  generation_notes: |
    A prestigious academic campus in Waterdeep's Castle Ward, organized around a central
    lawn with pale marble facades that throw brilliant morning glare. The grand amphitheater
    seats three hundred for lectures and symposia. Covered colonnades provide all-weather
    circulation between buildings. This is where practical knowledge meets scholarly tradition—
    where a dwarf engineer with scars instead of theories proves that honest expertise
    commands respect.

# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Essential Truth of This Place
# ============================================================================

narrative_soul: |
  The Spire of Learning represents Waterdeep's commitment to knowledge—pale marble
  catching morning light, scholars debating in arcaded walks, three hundred minds
  gathering to learn. But beneath the academic formality lives a truth: knowledge
  earned through experience carries weight that theory cannot match.

  When Grimjaw Ironbeard stands at the amphitheater podium, compass from a craftsman
  in his vest pocket, he embodies this truth. "Engineering is not about knowing all
  the answers. It's about asking the right questions when everything is falling apart."
  The practical wisdom of a dwarf who has faced mine collapses and structural failures
  commands respect that no academic credential could grant.
