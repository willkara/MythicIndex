    prompt_used: "heavy cream parchment texture, precise black ink technical lines (engineering/magic), scholarly annotations in margins, brass pin holding corner, dark oak rail background, amber lamp lighting, Close-up detail of a technical engineering diagram pinned to the wooden rails behind the amphitheater podium. The parchment is heavy, cream-colored, marked with precise black ink lines showing structural load vectors, truss geometries, or magical flow dynamics. Annotations in scholarly script fill the margins. A brass pin holds the corner. The lighting is amber and even (from the lecture hall lamps), illuminating the paper texture and the crispness of the ink. In the background, blurred by shallow depth of field, is the dark oak of the rail and perhaps the vague shape of the speaker's hand or the podium edge. This is what 'truth' looks like here: verifiable, calculated, drawn., Narrative context: Validates the 'Diagram Rails' canon element. Shows that the Spire is about *applied* knowledge, not just theory. The complexity of the drawing implies the sophistication of the world's engineering/magic., Macro or tight shot on the diagram. The ink lines and paper texture are the subject. Shallow depth of field to isolate the specific calculation being presented.

        SCENARIO: heavy cream parchment texture, precise black ink technical lines (engineering/magic), scholarly annotations in margins, brass pin holding corner, dark oak rail background, amber lamp lighting, Close-up detail of a technical engineering diagram pinned to the wooden rails behind the amphitheater podium. The parchment is heavy, cream-colored, marked with precise black ink lines showing structural load vectors, truss geometries, or magical flow dynamics. Annotations in scholarly script fill the margins. A brass pin holds the corner. The lighting is amber and even (from the lecture hall lamps), illuminating the paper texture and the crispness of the ink. In the background, blurred by shallow depth of field, is the dark oak of the rail and perhaps the vague shape of the speaker's hand or the podium edge.
