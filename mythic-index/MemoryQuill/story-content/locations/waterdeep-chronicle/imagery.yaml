# NARRATIVE SOUL - Thematic Essence for AI Generation
# ============================================================================
narrative_soul: |
  The Waterdeep Chronicle is where truth becomes narrative and omission becomes
  policy. This print shop represents the power of information curation—not what
  they say, but what they choose not to say. The smell of ink and the clatter
  of type frames a fundamental tension: between street-level truth and official
  narrative, between the whispers on the docks and the columns on page three.
  When Tennison Quill and his staff compose the Small Notices, they know that
  sometimes the blank they leave is the story. The Chronicle's broadsheets carry
  Veyra's terse quotes—"I'm not a symbol. I'm a solution"—stripped of context,
  shaped for consumption. Yet between the lines, in the margins where expensive
  ink hasn't touched, truth seeps through for those who know how to read silence.
  This is a space of newsprint gray and ink-black authority, where the gap
  between paper and reality is the most important distance in Waterdeep.

one_line_essence: "Where public narrative is constructed through print and what's not printed tells the true story."
