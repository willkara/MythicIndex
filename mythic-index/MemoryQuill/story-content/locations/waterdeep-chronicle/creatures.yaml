creatures:
  - name: Ink Imp
    description: Mischievous tiny creatures that live in inkwells and printing equipment. They improve ink quality and help with printing alignment but demand payment in the form of interesting stories. Bore them and they'll sabotage the presses.
    visual_aspects:
      - Humanoid forms no larger than a finger
      - Bodies appear to be made of living ink, constantly dripping
      - Eyes like white dots on black faces

      how: Sabotage boring stories; help produce compelling ones
    lore: Chronicle journalists know the Ink Imps' standards are brutal but fair. Boring, derivative stories result in smeared prints and jammed presses. Truly compelling journalism gets perfect ink distribution and flawless printing. One reporter wrote a groundbreaking exposé—the Imps worked through the night producing the cleanest print run in Chronicle history. The story won awards.

  - name: Rumor Moth
    description: Large moths that flutter in through windows carrying gossip and news on their wings. Their wing patterns shift to show headlines and story snippets. Journalists who can read them get incredible scoops, but the information is fragmentary and must be verified.
    visual_aspects:
      - Wingspan of 5-7 inches with pale, text-covered wings
      - Patterns constantly shift showing words and simple images
      - Flutter around journalists working on specific stories

      why: Drawn to information and truth-seeking
    behavior:
      who: Dozens passing through; origin unknown
      what: Carry fragmentary but accurate news on their wings
      how: Display information in shifting wing patterns
    lore: Every major scoop in Chronicle history started with a Rumor Moth. A moth with red wings and fire patterns arrived hours before a major warehouse fire—journalist followed the lead and got exclusive coverage. They're not always right, but they're never boring. Smart reporters verify moth-news but know to take it seriously.

  - name: Truth Echo
    description: An acoustic phenomenon in the newsroom where lies spoken aloud create discordant echoes, while truth rings clear. Not sentient but incredibly useful—it's nearly impossible to lie successfully in the Chronicle offices, keeping journalism honest.
    visual_aspects:
      - No physical form; purely acoustic
      - Lies create muddy, unpleasant echoes that make speakers uncomfortable
      - Truth creates clear, almost musical resonance
      - Effect strongest near editorial desks
      - Sensitive journalists can "hear" dishonesty in others' words
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the newsroom, strongest in editorial areas
      when: Constant presence, activated by spoken words
      why: Accumulated dedication to truth creating environmental effect
    behavior:
      who: Not sentient; architectural/magical quirk
      what: Makes lies sound wrong and truth sound right
      how: Acoustic resonance responding to speaker's intent
    lore: New journalists think they're going crazy until it's explained. "The room knows when you're lying." It keeps reporting honest—hard to write false stories when every dishonest phrase you speak sounds awful. One corrupt official tried bribing a journalist in the newsroom. Every word of his offer created horrible discordant echoes. The journalist wrote the bribery attempt as her story.

      - Often seen carrying small slips of paper in their mouths
      - Move with purpose, not random rodent scurrying

    habitat:
      where: Archive rooms and storage areas
      when: Constantly active maintaining perfect organization
      why: Emerged from necessity of managing decades of papers
    behavior:
      who: Colony of 20-30 with clear division of labor
      what: Organize archives, locate specific articles, guide researchers
      how: Create trails of paper scraps or movement patterns leading to requested items
    lore: Researchers know to speak requests aloud when entering archives. "I need the 1452 DR fire coverage." Within minutes, Archive Mice create a trail of paper scraps leading to that exact section. They never make mistakes. The Chief Archivist claims they understand journalism better than most reporters—they always prioritize the most relevant sources.
