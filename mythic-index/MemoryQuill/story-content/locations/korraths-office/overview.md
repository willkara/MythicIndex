# Korrath Threnx’s Office – Overview

## Basic Information
- **Type**: Structural engineering office / precision workshop
- **Region**: Waterdeep (Castle Ward, artisan row)
- **Coordinates/Position**: Near Cidrella Vexweld’s workshop among high-skill specialty trades
- **First Appearance**: Chapter 33 (An Architect’s Honor)
- **Significance Level**: Moderate (major turning point for the Silent Hand facility arc)

## Quick Description
Korrath Threnx’s workspace is the antithesis of improvised tinkering: a cathedral of precision where every tool has a place and every place has a label. Meticulously filed blueprint tubes line the walls; stone and metal samples sit in identical compartments marked with tolerances and coefficients. A massive oak drafting table anchors the room, lit at angles that banish shadow and leave no excuse for error.

## Visual Summary
- Blueprint tubes sorted by date and project type; labels crisp and uniform; many bear the Threnx family seal
- Pegboard tool walls laid out like a military inspection
- Sample compartments for stone and metal, each marked with load tolerances and thermal behavior
- Scale models of bridges and fortifications, aligned and pinned at critical load points

## Story Role
- **Plot Relevance**:
  - The confrontation where Korrath learns his family’s work was perverted into a prison
  - The pivot from shock to focused redemption: identifying failure modes and access points that can save captives
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Honor as engineering—faith in work made manifest, then tested
- **Recurring Location**: Potentially (planning, audits, and structural countermeasures)

## Key Features
- **Notable Landmarks**: Drafting table, blueprint archive wall, tool boards, sample library, model shelves
- **Unique Aspects**: Precision lighting and organization optimized for long design hours; an environment built to prevent mistakes
- **Hazards/Dangers**: Minimal day-to-day; rare but intense electrical charge when Korrath’s draconic power manifests under stress
- **Resources/Attractions**: Structural analysis expertise, load-path modeling, access to high-grade materials and guild standards

## Connections
- **Connected Locations**:
  - *Cidrella Vexweld’s Workshop*: Close collaborator space (`cids-workshop`)
  - *Dock Ward Warehouse Complex*: Operational partner and client context (`dock-ward-warehouse-complex`)
- **Transportation Methods**: Foot travel within the city; carts for samples and models
- **Distance from Other Key Locations**: Within the city’s day-to-day walkable network between wards

## Accessibility
- **Who Can Access**: Clients, guild contacts, collaborators by appointment
- **Restrictions**: Controlled entry and professional formality; the space is as much reputation as workspace
- **Hidden Aspects**: Private project archives and family-sealed plans
- **Secret Paths/Entrances**: None known; security is social and procedural

## Notes
*The office should feel quiet, spare, and relentlessly intentional—an engineered environment where even emotion threatens to become a failure mode.*
