narrative_soul: |
  Korrath Threnx's office is a blueprint made physical—every tool in its
  place, every place labeled, every angle true. The space exists to prevent
  mistakes: lighting positioned to banish shadow, sound controlled so that
  tools don't rattle, papers don't drift, and footsteps feel too loud on
  purpose. This is where the Threnx family tradition of engineering excellence
  manifests in oak and stone and bronze.

  The archive wall holds generations of blueprints, many bearing the family
  seal. The tool boards read like military inspections. The sample library
  catalogs stone and metal by compression rating and thermal coefficient.
  Scale models demonstrate load paths you can touch with tiny brass pins
  marking critical points.

  But the precision that defines this space cannot contain what happens
  when Korrath learns his masterwork—the facility he designed with such
  care—imprisons trafficked children. The bronze dragonborn's heritage
  manifests: lightning arcs across his scales like living veins of light,
  ozone sharpens the air, and for a terrible moment the cathedral of
  control becomes a storm. Only Grimjaw's wisdom reaches him: "The same
  hands that built the cage can build the key."

one_line_essence: "Where precision is honor and a builder discovers his cage must become a key"
