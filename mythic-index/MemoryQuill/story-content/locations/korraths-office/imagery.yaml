            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            Generate a NEW scene matching the scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Avoid “real-world medieval Europe” drift; keep fantasy species variety and magical infrastructure plausible and grounded-in-world (not neon).

            5. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.


            SCENARIO: oak drafting table with current work visible, magnification tools and straightedges at exact reach, archive wall with family seals at eye level, at least one scale model with brass pins visible, multiple light sources, shadow-free illumination, massive immaculate oak drafting table as room anchor, archive wall of cylindrical blueprint tubes in labeled ranks, Threnx family seal (wax or stamped) visible on older tubes, pegboard tool walls with graduated tools in military alignment, scale models of bridges and fortifications with tiny brass pins, precision multi-angle lighting eliminating shadow on work surfaces, fine rune-inlay along straightedges and drafting tools (precision wards), blueprint tubes sealed with faint anti-tamper sigils (family craft magic), a small scry-safe circle worked into the floor (privacy ward), everburning lamp lenses with steady warm light (no flicker), Medium view centered on the drafting table, seeing it as Korrath would see it when beginning work. The immaculate oak surface holds current drawings—load calculations, structural diagrams—with instruments positioned at exact reach. The archive wall rises behind, family seals visible at eye level, generations of work in labeled ranks. A scale model of a bridge sits nearby, brass pins marking load paths you could trace with a finger. Everything speaks of accumulated expertise, inherited craft, faith that good work protects people. The multiple lamps cast even light across every surface. No shadows. No excuses. No mistakes., Faerûn high-fantasy interior cues (subtle, believable magic): enchanted lanterns/sconces, rune-inlaid beams, warding motifs worked into stone and metal, arcane guild seals and sigils as functional infrastructure, Narrative context: This is the image that must be internalized before Chapter 33. The viewer needs to feel what this space means—its function as moral architecture—so that the revelation about the prison designs carries its full devastating weight., Medium shot, slightly lower angle—as if Korrath's perspective approaching his own workspace. Drafting table dominant in lower frame, archive wall creating depth above and behind. Family seals at eye level, readable as significant.

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a specific LOCATION.

            Generate a NEW image of this SAME location in the described scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. LOCATION IDENTITY: Preserve architecture, materials, lighting language, and signature elements from the references.

            2. FANTASY TONE: This is a high-fantasy world (D&D / Faerûn vibe). Include subtle magical infrastructure (runes, enchanted lanterns, ward-stones, guild sigils) where appropriate.

            3. NO FACE CLONING: If people appear, keep them generic and varied—do not repeat an identical face across images unless explicitly required.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            5. PRIORITY: If the scenario conflicts with the references, follow the scenario for composition/mood while preserving the location’s identity.


            SCENARIO: cylindrical blueprint tubes in ranked rows, crisp uniform labels on cream paper, Threnx family seal in deep burgundy wax, clearly visible, mix of older (yellowed labels) and newer tubes, logical ordering system apparent, even illumination for reading labels, massive immaculate oak drafting table as room anchor, archive wall of cylindrical blueprint tubes in labeled ranks, Threnx family seal (wax or stamped) visible on older tubes, pegboard tool walls with graduated tools in military alignment, scale models of bridges and fortifications with tiny brass pins, precision multi-angle lighting eliminating shadow on work surfaces, fine rune-inlay along straightedges and drafting tools (precision wards), blueprint tubes sealed with faint anti-tamper sigils (family craft magic), a small scry-safe circle worked into the floor (privacy ward), everburning lamp lenses with steady warm light (no flicker), Close view of the blueprint archive wall. Cylindrical tubes in labeled ranks, sorted by date and project type. The labels are crisp and uniform— drafting-precise lettering on cream paper tags. Many tubes bear the Threnx family seal in deep burgundy wax, generations of structural work catalogued and preserved. The system is designed for fast retrieval: logical ordering, clear categorization. A hand could find any project in seconds. The tubes are well-maintained, some clearly older with yellowed labels, the family seal the constant across decades., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: These tubes will become accusations in Chapter 33. Establishing them as sources of pride—family legacy, accumulated expertise—makes their later transformation into evidence of complicity more devastating., Close-medium shot of the archive section, filling frame with tubes. Angled to show depth of the archive and the repetition of labeled tubes. Family seals should be clearly visible and readable as significant markers. Perhaps slight diagonal composition to create visual interest in the geometric repetition., any, irrelevant, light from reflected lamplight, even, functional, front-lit for label readability, warm tones, minimal shadows, none, dominant colors: cream paper labels, aged tube material (leather or treated paper), burgundy seal wax; accent colors: brass or iron tube caps, yellowed older labels, high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: oiled oak, warm amber-brown, immaculate surfaces, dark walnut shelving and pegboard frames, vellum and heavy drafting paper, cream to ivory, Mood intent: The archive wall represents legacy—inherited expertise, family honor, accumulated wisdom. Before Chapter 33, this is a source of pride. The intimate mood captures the personal relationship to inherited work.

            , epic high-fantasy exterior, fantastical silhouettes and skyline, arcane lanterns and ward-lights, subtle magical phenomena integrated into the environment, dynamic skies, cinematic composition, atmospheric depth, Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.

            The images above are REFERENCE IMAGES for a scene. They may include:

            - character portraits (identity references)

            - a location overview (environment reference)

            - style references (art direction)


            Generate a NEW scene matching the scenario.


            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Avoid “real-world medieval Europe” drift; keep fantasy species variety and magical infrastructure plausible and grounded-in-world (not neon).

            5. PRIORITY: If scenario conflicts with references, follow the scenario for action/composition while keeping identity and location continuity.


            SCENARIO: massive oak drafting table, immaculate, archive wall with cylindrical blueprint tubes in labeled ranks, visible Threnx family seals (wax, burgundy) on older tubes, pegboard tool walls with graduated sizes, military alignment, scale models visible on shelving, multiple precision lamps creating even illumination, sample compartments with stone and metal visible, magnification tools and straightedges on drafting table, massive immaculate oak drafting table as room anchor, archive wall of cylindrical blueprint tubes in labeled ranks, Threnx family seal (wax or stamped) visible on older tubes, pegboard tool walls with graduated tools in military alignment, scale models of bridges and fortifications with tiny brass pins, precision multi-angle lighting eliminating shadow on work surfaces, fine rune-inlay along straightedges and drafting tools (precision wards), blueprint tubes sealed with faint anti-tamper sigils (family craft magic), a small scry-safe circle worked into the floor (privacy ward), everburning lamp lenses with steady warm light (no flicker), Korrath at the drafting table, bent over spread blueprints with focused intensity. His clawed hands trace load paths, make notations, the same precision that designed now deployed to dismantle. A scale model sits beside him with brass pins repositioned—no longer marking where structures are strongest, but where they're weakest. The emotion of the revelation has been transmuted into cold purpose. The family-sealed tubes are still visible behind him, but his attention has moved forward—from what was done to what he will undo., Faerûn high-fantasy urban cues (subtle, believable magic): ward-lanterns/everburning lights, rune-carved signage and safety wards, alchemical-ink guild seals, mixed ancestries in the periphery (dwarf, tiefling, dragonborn, halfling) if people appear, Narrative context: The transformation from victim to agent. The same skills that were unwittingly complicit now become weapons of redemption. The space returns to its function—but with changed purpose., Close-medium shot focused on Korrath's work—hands on blueprints, model nearby with repositioned pins. His face visible but the emphasis on the work itself. Archive wall in soft focus behind, present but no longer the subject. Lighting returned to normal precision—the storm has passed., light from precision lamps, even, clear, purposeful, multi-angle work lighting, warm but clear tones, minimal, functional shadows, controlled calm after storm, dominant colors: oak amber, cream paper, brass pins; accent colors: dragonborn scales, ink notations, high fantasy, intimate atmosphere, materials: oiled oak, warm amber-brown, immaculate surfaces, dark walnut shelving and pegboard frames, vellum and heavy drafting paper, cream to ivory, Mood intent: The intimate mood captures the quiet intensity of focused work—not the explosive tension of revelation, but the controlled burn of determination. This is Korrath reclaiming his expertise for justice.

            , storytelling moment, high-fantasy adventuring tone, emotional lighting, atmospheric depth, subtle spell effects, focus on character expressions, dramatic composition, Painterly cinematic high fantasy with grounded physicality.

            1. CHARACTER IDENTITY: If portraits are present, keep each character distinct and consistent (face, hair, key identifiers). Do not merge identities.

            2. LOCATION CONTINUITY: Preserve the location’s architectural identity and design language from any location references.

            3. FANTASY TONE: High-fantasy (D&D / Faerûn vibe) with believable magical details integrated into the world.

            3. NO FACE CLONING: If people appear, keep them generic and varied—do not repeat an identical face across images unless explicitly required.

            4. AVOID GROUNDED HISTORY: Do not drift into “historical reenactment” or real-world medieval Europe. Keep the design language unmistakably fantasy (Faerûn) even when the scene is gritty and practical.

            5. PRIORITY: If the scenario conflicts with the references, follow the scenario for composition/mood while preserving the location’s identity.
