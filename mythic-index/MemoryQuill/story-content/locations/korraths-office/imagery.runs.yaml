His dragonborn form is taut with suppressed fury or anguish—scales possibly raised, posture locked. Blue-white electrical discharge arcs between his fingers, jumps along nearby metal tools which hum with transferred charge.

The family seals, burgundy wax, seem to burn in the lamplight. Everything that meant honor now means complicity., Narrative context: The pivotal moment of the arc.
