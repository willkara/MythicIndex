The user is requesting a location analysis for Korrath Threnx's Office. Let me work through the analytical framework systematically.

From the provided files:

**Overview.md:**
- Type: Structural engineering office / precision workshop
- Region: Waterdeep (Castle Ward, artisan row)
- Near Cidrella Vexweld's workshop
- First Appearance: Chapter 33 (An Architect's Honor)
- Significance: Moderate but major turning point for Silent Hand facility arc
- Key story moment: Confrontation where Korrath learns his family's work was perverted into a prison
- Symbolic meaning: Honor as engineering—faith in work made manifest, then tested

**Description.md:**
- Castle Ward artisan-row workshop
- Order as Architecture - right angles, clear sightlines, dedicated zones
- Archive Wall with blueprint tubes, many with Threnx family seal
- Tool Discipline - pegboards with graduated tools
- Material Library - samples marked with tolerances
- Model Shelves - scale bridges and fortifications with brass pins
- Massive oak drafting table
- Lighting positioned to eliminate shadow
- Sound controlled
- Under extreme stress: metallic taste, tools may hum - draconic electricity

**Inhabitants.md:**
- Korrath Threnx: Dragonborn structural engineer
- Clients, inspectors, collaborators (including Cid)

Now let me build the analysis:

**Narrative Soul:** This is a space where honor is made physical. The precision isn't aesthetic preference—it's moral philosophy. Every aligned tool, every labeled tube, every measured compartment says: "I do not make mistakes because mistakes hurt people." The Chapter 33 revelation that Korrath's family work was perverted into a prison is devastating precisely because this space represents faith that good work serves good ends.

**Location Type:** This is a forge/workshop type location - a place of creation and transformation.

**Zones:**
1. The Drafting Table (Heart) - The symbolic center where designs come into being


2. The Archive Wall serves as a sanctuary of professional memory, preserving family legacy through meticulously sealed blueprint tubes
3. Tool Boards represent disciplined craftsmanship, each graduated instrument telling a story of precision
4. Material Library embodies potential - raw elements waiting to be transformed
5. Model Shelves bridge imagination and reality, where conceptual designs become tangible representations
6. Entry/Reception marks the threshold between external world and internal creative space

**Temporal States** reveal the office's dynamic nature:
- Shifts between active work and contemplative emptiness
- Transformation from innocence to painful revelation
- Potential for latent draconic energy emerging under extreme emotional stress

**Character-Space Relationship** demonstrates profound interconnection: Korrath's workspace is a physical manifestation of his professional identity, values, and inner conflict, particularly highlighted by the pivotal Chapter 33 moment of disillusionment.

His professional integrity was systematically undermined, forcing a strategic recalibration. The confrontation exposed fundamental betrayals, compelling Korrath to leverage his analytical precision in identifying institutional vulnerabilities, transforming personal pain into methodical redemption.
