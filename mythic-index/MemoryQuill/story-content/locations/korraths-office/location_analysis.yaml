  narrative_soul: |
    This space is honor made physical—a moral philosophy expressed through aligned tools 
    and labeled compartments. Every element declares: "I do not make mistakes because 
    mistakes hurt people." The Chapter 33 revelation that Korrath's family work was 
    perverted into a prison becomes devastating precisely because this room embodies 
    faith that good work serves good ends. It's where that faith shatters—and where 
    it rebuilds into something sharper.
    
  one_line_essence: "Precision as prayer, now tested by betrayal"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "Honor as engineering—integrity made visible"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "Legacy (family seal on blueprint tubes)"
      - "Control as virtue (nothing left to chance)"
      - "The lie of clean hands (your work can be turned against innocents)"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "precision vs. chaos (of emotion, of learning the truth)"
      - "individual honor vs. inherited complicity"
      - "control vs. helplessness"
      - "creation vs. weaponization"

  transformation_arc: |
    Before Chapter 33, this space represents Korrath's unshaken faith in his craft and 
    lineage. The room is a shrine to competence and ethical work. During the confrontation, 
    the space becomes a witness to shattering revelation—the precision that usually 
    comforts now mocks, each family-sealed tube a potential betrayal. After the pivot, 
    the same tools and archives become weapons: Korrath's engineering mind turns from 
    shock to focused analysis, identifying failure modes and access points. The space 
    hasn't changed physically, but its meaning transforms from "this is what I am" 
    to "this is how I make it right."

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Late-medieval professional workshop, optimized for precision work"
  primary_materials:
    - "Oak (drafting table, structural elements)"
    - "Stone (sample compartments)"
    - "Metal (tools, sample materials, brass model pins)"
    - "Vellum and paper (blueprints)"
  scale_impression: "Controlled and contained—not large, but every cubic inch intentional"
  
  visual_signature: |
    The archive wall of cylindrical blueprint tubes in labeled ranks—many bearing the 
    Threnx family seal—creates a geometry of accumulated expertise. The massive oak 
    drafting table anchors the room like an altar. Scale models of bridges and 
    fortifications with tiny brass pins marking load points make abstract engineering 
    tangible and touchable.
    
  sound_signature: |
    Aggressive quiet. Sound is controlled: tools don't rattle, papers don't drift. 
    Footsteps feel too loud on purpose—the silence is engineered to make distraction 
    feel like intrusion. Only the faint tick of measuring tools punctuates the stillness.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Oiled wood, clean paper, and metal polish—minimal, deliberate, professional. 
    No food smells, no body odor, no chaos of daily life. Under extreme stress, 
    a metallic taste enters the air (draconic electricity bleeding through).
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Hard surfaces, exact edges, cool metal. Everything is meant to be touched with 
    purpose—straightedges that slide true, sample stones smooth from handling, 
    paper that lies flat. The temperature is neutral, controlled.

  light_character: |
    Precision lighting designed to banish shadow—no excuse for error, no corner where 
    a line might be misread. Bright where work happens, dark nowhere by accident. 
    The light is utilitarian, not atmospheric; it serves clarity above mood. 
    Multiple angles prevent any single shadow from forming on the drafting surface.
    
  weather_influence: |
    Largely sealed from weather. Temperature controlled for paper preservation and 
    material stability. Rain would be audible but not intrusive—another controlled 
    variable, not a disruption.

contextual_place:

  neighborhood_character: |
    Artisan row among high-skill specialty trades—goldsmiths, precision instrument 
    makers, Cidrella Vexweld's workshop nearby. Professional rather than commercial; 
    reputation-based business rather than foot traffic. The neighbors are colleagues 
    as much as competitors.

  spatial_relationship: |
    Embedded within a community of high-skill trades, with Cidrella Vexweld's workshop 
    close enough for collaboration. The office exists within a network of expertise 
    rather than isolation. Access to the Dock Ward Warehouse Complex (client context) 
    is within the city's walkable network.
