This is a request to create location imagery specifications for Korrath Threnx's Office. Let me analyze what I've been given:

1. A detailed location analysis from the Location Story Analyst
2. Source files (overview.md and description.md) for canon verification
3. The role specification for how to create imagery

Key elements I need to capture:

**Narrative Soul:** "Precision as prayer, now tested by betrayal" - This space embodies honor as engineering, where every tool placement is a statement of values.

**Physical Truth:**
- Late-medieval professional workshop
- Oak drafting table (massive, immaculate)
- Blueprint archive wall with cylindrical tubes, many bearing Threnx family seal
- Pegboard tool walls in military-inspection alignment
- Sample compartments marked with tolerances
- Scale models with brass pins at load points
- Precision lighting that eliminates shadow
- Quiet, controlled environment

**Key Zones:**
1. Drafting Table (heart) - the altar of his faith
2. Archive Wall (sanctuary) - legacy storage, family seals
3. Model Shelves (forge) - scale bridges and fortifications
4. Tool Boards (forge) - military precision
5. Material Library (forge) - samples with tolerances

**Recommended Images from Analysis:**
1. ESSENCE (primary) - The office as embodiment of values before revelation
2. BEAT (primary) - Chapter 33 revelation with draconic electricity
3. BEAT (secondary) - Chapter 33 pivot to engineering redemption
4. ZONE (secondary) - Archive wall detail with family seals
5. ZONE (optional) - Scale models with brass pins

**Character:** Korrath Threnx - I don't have his imagery.yaml, but I need to work with what's in the analysis:
- Dragonborn
- Draconic electricity can manifest under stress (tools hum, metallic taste, possible arcing)

**Moods:**
- Intimate for the essence/baseline state


- Tense for the revelation moment
- Intimate for the pivot/redemption

I'll establish visual anchors with consistent elements like the massive oak drafting table, archive wall with cylindrical blueprint tubes, and Threnx family seal. The materials will include oak, stone, metal, and vellum, creating a palette of warm browns and stone greys that reflect the office's precision and heritage.

The color scheme and material choices will underscore the narrative of engineering honor, with each element carefully selected to represent Korrath Threnx's professional ethos and personal history.

Metallic accents in brass and bronze will catch light, creating subtle gleams against cream paper and iron-grey tools. Precision lighting will eliminate shadows where work happens, revealing every meticulous detail of the workspace.

The workshop's visual structure will capture both the tense revelation moment and the intimate pivot of analysis, using zone shots of the archive wall and scale models to communicate the deeper narrative of the space.

Aspect ratios will strategically frame different perspectives: wide landscape views for overview, more intimate portrait and square formats for detailed moments and character interactions. The dragonborn engineer's electrical heritage suggests dynamic visual potential within these carefully composed frames.
