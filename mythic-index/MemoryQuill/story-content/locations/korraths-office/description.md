# Korrath Threnx’s Office – Physical Description

## Site & Building
- **Setting**: A Castle Ward artisan-row workshop designed for high-precision drafting and material testing, not production noise. Built to support heavy tables, sample storage, and long hours.

## Interior Character
- **Order as Architecture**: The room reads like a blueprint made physical—right angles, clear sightlines, and dedicated zones for each task.
- **Archive Wall**: Cylindrical blueprint tubes in labeled ranks; retrieval designed for speed without disorder. Many bear the Threnx family seal.
- **Tool Discipline**: Pegboards with tools in graduated sizes, aligned to a repeatable pattern; missing tools are immediately visible.
- **Material Library**: Stone and metal samples in identical compartments, each marked with load tolerances, compression ratings, and thermal coefficients.
- **Model Shelves**: Scale bridges and fortifications with tiny brass pins marking critical points—load paths you can touch.
- **Primary Drafting Table**: A massive oak surface kept immaculate; magnification tools and straightedges placed at exact reach.

## Light & Atmosphere
- Lighting positioned to eliminate shadow and reduce eye strain; the space is bright where it must be and dark nowhere by accident.
- Sound is controlled: tools don’t rattle, papers don’t drift, and footsteps feel too loud on purpose.

## Sensory Environment
- **Smell**: Oiled wood, clean paper, and metal—minimal distractions.
- **Sound**: Quiet, interrupted only by deliberate movement or the faint tick of measuring tools.
- **Other**: Under extreme stress, the air can take on a metallic taste and tools may hum—draconic electricity bleeding into the environment.
