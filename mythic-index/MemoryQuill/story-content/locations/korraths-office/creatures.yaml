creatures:
  - name: Blueprint Wisp
    description: Glowing blue lights that trace through the air along the lines of structures Korrath has designed. They appear when he's problem-solving, showing potential structural solutions in three-dimensional light. His own genius made partially visible.
    visual_aspects:
      - Lines of blue-white light that trace geometric patterns
      - Form temporary architectural diagrams in mid-air
      - Precise and mathematical in movement
      - Glow intensifies when Korrath approaches correct solutions
      - Fade when problem is solved or abandoned
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the office, especially near drafting tables
      when: Appear during intense design work and problem-solving
      why: Manifestation of Korrath's engineering brilliance interacting with workspace
    behavior:
      who: Multiple wisps or possibly single entity showing multiple solutions
      what: Visualize structural concepts and engineering solutions
      how: Respond to Korrath's thinking, showing options he's considering
    lore: Korrath doesn't fully understand them but has learned to work with them. When stuck, he'll watch the wisps—they often show solutions he hasn't consciously considered yet. Cidri claims they're his subconscious engineering intuition made visible. He suspects they're proof that truly beautiful mathematics wants to manifest in reality.

  - name: Calculation Cricket
    description: Invisible insects that chirp in mathematical rhythms. Each chirp represents a number or calculation. Korrath has learned to interpret them, using their sounds to check his arithmetic. They catch errors before they make it to final plans.
    visual_aspects:
      - Completely invisible; known only by sound
      - Chirps sound like cricket songs but in precise mathematical patterns
      - Different pitches represent different numerical operations
      - Volume increases near calculation errors
      - Create harmonies when calculations are correct
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the office, especially near calculation-heavy work
      when: Most active during mathematical work and drafting
      why: Unknown origin; possibly attracted to concentrated mathematical thinking
    behavior:
      who: Population unknown; possibly dozens based on sound patterns
      what: Chirp in patterns representing numbers and mathematical relationships
      how: Seem to perform calculations independently; alert to errors
    lore: Korrath discovered them by accident when a calculation felt wrong. The chirping became discordant. He rechecked and found an error. Now he leaves deliberate mistakes occasionally to test them—they catch every one. His assistant tried to learn the chirp-language but gave up. Korrath says it's not about learning—it's about listening until understanding arrives.

  - name: Level Bubble Spirit
    description: A small air elemental that lives inside Korrath's favorite level. It ensures the bubble is perfectly centered on true level, making the tool supernaturally accurate. Other engineers have tried to buy the level for fortunes. It's not for sale.
    visual_aspects:
      - Visible only as the bubble in the level's vial
      - Moves with impossible precision to exact center on true level
      - Glows very faintly when the tool is used correctly
      - Creates slight warmth in the level when handled
      - Occasionally forms tiny geometric shapes within the bubble
    habitat:
      where: Residing within Korrath's master brass-and-rosewood level
      when: Active whenever the level is used
      why: Bonded to the tool generations ago; serves current owner
    behavior:
      who: Single ancient spirit bound to the tool
      what: Provides perfect accuracy; will never give false reading
      how: Controls bubble position with supernatural precision
    lore: The level was his grandfather's, and his great-grandfather's before that. Family legend says a grateful earth elemental bound itself to the tool after an ancestor's engineering saved a mountain village from collapse. Korrath has verified structures from fifty years ago using it—they're still perfectly level. The tool itself may be the most structurally important object in Waterdeep.

  - name: Stress Ghost
    description: Translucent visualization of structural stress that appears on models and drawings Korrath is reviewing. It shows weak points as darkened areas and load paths as flowing lines, making invisible forces visible. It's saved countless lives by revealing flaws before construction.
    visual_aspects:
      - Appears as colored overlays on drawings and models
      - Red areas indicate dangerous stress concentrations
      - Blue lines show optimal load paths
      - Green regions mark areas that could be lighter/cheaper
      - Visible only to those with engineering understanding
    habitat:
      where: On drawings, blueprints, and physical models in the office
      when: Appears when Korrath or other engineers review structural designs
      why: Magic responding to engineering expertise and structural awareness
    behavior:
      who: Possibly multiple phenomena or single analytical presence
      what: Visualizes invisible structural forces and stresses
      how: Responds to viewer's engineering knowledge; shows what they need to see
    lore: Korrath credits it with every successful project. The Silent Hand facility's systems never fail because the Stress Ghost showed him every weak point during design. He's tried to teach others to see it—those with real engineering talent can. "If you truly understand how forces flow," he says, "eventually you start seeing them. The Ghost just makes it clearer."
