## Template Usage Guidelines

### Creating ASCII Diagrams
1. **Site Overview**: Show building positions, boundaries, major features
2. **Floor Plans**: Display room layouts, connections, key features
3. **Cross-Sections**: Illustrate multi-level relationships
4. **Flow Diagrams**: Map traffic patterns and access control

### Canon Integration
- Use **[FIRM: ch##]** for chapter-established facts
- Use **[IMPLIED]** for logical extensions
- Use **[DRAFT: ch##]** for draft chapter content
- Mark flexible areas for future development

### Physical Authenticity
- Ensure materials and methods suit the setting
- Make structural engineering realistic
- Validate spatial relationships for described activities
- Consider environmental factors affecting construction

### Reference Integration
- Each major section should support imagery.yaml references
- Include specific details that can inform visual descriptions
- Maintain consistency with overview.md
- Provide clear section headers for cross-referencing
