  narrative_soul: |
    The Masons' Guildhall is craft elevated to civic religion—a building that teaches 
    through its own existence. Every stone, from the rough-dressed granite plinth to the 
    polished marble orders above, demonstrates mastery while demanding it of those who 
    would call themselves masons. This is where practical knowledge becomes institutional 
    authority, where a dwarf's unconventional lever technique might find legitimacy in 
    the eyes of the establishment. It represents both the city's literal foundation and 
    the idea that competence, properly demonstrated, earns the right to shape permanence.

  transformation_arc: |
    In the context of Chapter 24, the Guildhall represents potential external validation 
    of the Company's capabilities—specifically Grimjaw's engineering innovations. The 
    Guild's interest in the counter-lever method suggests a world that notices and 
    respects genuine competence, even from unconventional sources. The building itself 
    doesn't transform, but its relationship to the Company shifts from unknown institution 
    to interested party, hinting at future collaboration or recognition.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Civic guild monumental—fortress-grade base course transitioning to refined classical orders; didactic architecture that demonstrates mastery through its own construction"
  
  primary_materials:
    - "Granite (footings, plinth, structural piers)"
    - "Marble and fine limestone ashlar (upper façade)"
    - "Lime mortar with pozzolanic amendment"
    - "Heavy oak (joists, purlins, doors)"
    - "Wrought iron (tie-bars, cramps) set in lead"
    - "Bronze (weather-exposed fixings, nameplates, door bindings)"
    - "Slate roofing with copper/lead flashings"
    - "Leaded glass in high arches"
    
  scale_impression: "Imposing civic monument—the building announces authority through proportion and permanence; the rusticated plinth creates a fortress impression that yields to classical refinement above, suggesting both strength and sophistication"
  
  visual_signature: |
    The façade tells a story of progression: rough-dressed granite at street level 
    (honest, uncompromising, fortress-strong) yields at the string course to polished 
    marble ashlar with refined classical orders. The deep voussoired portal with its 
    Guild seal keystone dominates the approach—14 feet of clear arch framing bronze-bound 
    oak doors. Statue niches of past Guildmasters flank the entrance like sentinels of 
    accumulated wisdom. Embedded demonstration panels in the façade show bond patterns 
    and tool marks, labeled in fine bronze script: the building as textbook.
    
  sound_signature: |
    The Grand Hall carries a lecturer's voice with resonant authority. The Library 
    absorbs sound into cedar shelving and drapery—the soft slide of plan drawers, 
    the rustle of vellum. Below, the basement provides measured rhythm: tap-tap of 
    chisels, the rasp of saw, the burble of lime-slaking cisterns. The bell cote 
    marks time overhead. Hoist chains clink in the service court.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Stone-cool and mineral-dry in the public halls. The Library offers cedar and 
    old leather bindings, beeswax on oak surfaces. Below: wet stone and lime, metal 
    filings, the fresh-cut smell of worked limestone. The Hearthstone Lounge carries 
    woodsmoke and lamp oil. Throughout: the particular scent of buildings made to last.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    Cool stone underfoot throughout; polished walking paths in the Hall contrast with 
    grit in the workshops. Brass rail wear from generations of hands. The temperature 
    gradient is notable: temperate public spaces yield to the constant cool of basement 
    vaults. Drafts controlled by shutters and vents create distinct air zones—still in 
    the Library, moving in the workshops.

  light_character: |
    The building is engineered for appropriate light in each zone. The Grand Hall receives 
    broad daylight through high arches—dramatic, lecture-worthy illumination that can 
    spotlight demonstration work. The Library employs a strict north-light strategy: 
    even, cool, non-fading light for examining drawings and plans, with louvered ridge 
    lanterns for modulation. Studios follow the same principle. The basement workshops 
    rely on hooded lamps and controlled apertures—work light, not display light. The 
    Examination Salon uses upper shutters to control exactly how much daylight falls on 
    candidate masterworks. The Hearthstone Lounge trades north-light clarity for warm 
    hearth glow.
    
  weather_influence: |
    The elevated plinth keeps street splash and seasonal floods at bay. The deep portal 
    provides shelter for those waiting entry. Freeze-thaw cycles require seasonal joint 
    inspections. Storm chains anchor at the portal for windscreens. Summer demands 
    night-flush cooling routines for upper galleries. The proving cellar and archives 
    remain climate-stable year-round through thermal mass.

contextual_place:
  region: "Trades Ward, Waterdeep"
  neighborhood_character: "Surrounded by artisan rows, quarry factors' offices, and civic bureaus—the working heart of Waterdeep's craft economy. The Guildhall is the most monumental building on its block, but exists among practical neighbors: workshops, materials suppliers, administrative offices. High pedestrian pressure on market days."
  
  approach_sequences:
    - name: "Ceremonial West Approach"
      description: "The formal approach reveals the full façade: the fortress-grade granite plinth establishing authority, the string course yielding to polished marble, the deep shadow of the grand portal with its seal keystone catching light. Past Guildmasters watch from their statue niches. The demonstration panels invite study even before entry."
      first_impression: "Institutional permanence—this building was made to outlast dynasties"
      
    - name: "Service East Lane"
      description: "A practical approach through the trade lanes. The rear service court comes into view: a wall jib-crane, the hoist hatch for moving stone and models, the working infrastructure hidden from ceremonial eyes. Here the building reveals its practical bones."
      first_impression: "Working efficiency beneath monumental dignity"
      
    - name: "Member's Side Wicket"
      description: "Members bypass the main queue through a smaller portal beside the grand arch—same stone, same craft, but scaled for daily use rather than ceremony. A quiet assertion of belonging."
      first_impression: "Insider access, earned through craft"
      
  visible_beyond:
    - direction: "West (from entry)"
      what_visible: "The street approach, neighboring guild buildings, the Trades Ward streetscape of workshops and factors' offices"

    - direction: "East (from service court)"
      what_visible: "Service lane, delivery wagons, the practical infrastructure of the Trades Ward"
      
  spatial_relationship: "The Guildhall anchors its block as both civic monument and working institution—ceremonial face to the main thoroughfare, practical operations screened behind. It sits firmly in Waterdeep's craft economy, connected to quarries, factors, and bureaus by proximity and profession."

      The members' lounge centers on a large fireplace; honor boards list distinguished 
      members; trophy friezes commemorate guild achievements. A warm, social space 
      contrasting with the formal authority below. Doors open to a small roof garden 
      and cloister arranged around the ridge lantern and bell cote. The roof walk 
      provides access for lightning rod checks and bell maintenance.
      
    narrative_function: "Where professional hierarchy relaxes into collegial fellowship—the social glue that makes an institution a community. Masters who judge sternly in the Examination Salon might share drinks here afterward. The roof cloister offers perspective: both literal (views over the city) and figurative (the long view of craft tradition)."
    
    emotional_register: "Earned ease—the warmth of belonging to something larger than oneself; fellowship among those who have proven their worth"
