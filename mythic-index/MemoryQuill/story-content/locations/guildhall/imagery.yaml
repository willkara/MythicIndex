# NARRATIVE SOUL - The Emotional Core
# ============================================================================
narrative_soul: |
  The Masons' Guildhall exists to teach by example. Every stone in its
  facade demonstrates technique—rusticated granite rising to polished
  marble, bond patterns labeled in bronze, tool marks left visible as
  lessons. The building doesn't merely house expertise; it embodies it.
  When you enter through the voussoired portal with its guild seal keystone,
  you're entering an argument made permanent: craft discipline matters,
  and those who master it serve foundations that outlast generations.

  This is where the city's structures receive their blessing or their
  condemnation. In the Proving Cellar, compression rigs test samples until
  they shatter or hold. In the Council chambers, disputes are arbitrated
  by those who understand load-bearing intimately. The Keystone Library
  preserves plans and surveys dating back centuries—the city's architectural
  memory made accessible.

  When the Masons' Guild voted to supply timber and materials to the
  Company, someone proposed letting them affix their symbol to repaired
  structures. The motion was tabled; laughter was recorded. Bureaucracy
  with warmth—craft supporting craft, aid through proper channels.
