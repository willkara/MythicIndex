creatures:
  - name: Contract Keeper
    description: Fastidious fey that guard guild contracts and agreements. They ensure all terms are met, all signatures genuine, and all obligations fulfilled. Breaking a guild contract with a Keeper present results in immediate magical notification to all parties.

      - Thin humanoid figures 10 inches tall in formal guild attire
      - Carry miniature ledgers and quill pens
      - Spectacles made from thin crystal that reflect contract terms
      - Move with officious dignity
      - Glow faintly when contract violations occur nearby
    habitat:

      when: Constantly vigilant; presence increases during important negotiations
      why: Emerged from guilds' collective need for enforceable agreements

      who: Colony of 15-20 organized by contract type
      what: Witness agreements, verify terms, alert violations
      how: Magical bond to contracts they witness; can't be fooled or bribed
    lore: No one tries to cheat on guild contracts anymore—the Keepers always know. A merchant tried forging a master craftsman's signature once. Every Keeper in the guildhall began glowing and shrieking simultaneously. The fraud was revealed instantly. Now their presence at signings is considered the ultimate guarantee of legitimacy.

  - name: Skill Echo
    description: Ghostly hands that appear over crafting work, demonstrating perfect technique. They show master-level skills to apprentices struggling with techniques, offering silent instruction through visual demonstration. Each echo comes from a different master craftsperson from guild history.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent hands performing specific craft techniques
      - Sometimes accompanied by partial arms or tools
      - Movement shows perfect form and precision
      - Glow with warm amber light
      - Different hands have different characteristics—scarred, calloused, aged
    habitat:
      where: Throughout guild workshops and training areas
      when: Appear to struggling apprentices at crucial learning moments
      why: Collective wisdom of dead masters manifesting to teach
    behavior:
      who: Hundreds of different echo-hands from guild's long history
      what: Demonstrate correct technique without words
      how: Appear next to apprentice's work, showing proper method
    lore: Every master craftsperson who's ever lived in the guildhall potentially contributes an echo. Apprentices learn to recognize specific masters by hand characteristics. "Old Three-Finger's hand showed me that joint technique" is common phrasing. Some apprentices swear they feel gentle correction when the echo-hands brush their own.

  - name: Quality Sprite
    description: Tiny critics that inspect finished work and indicate quality level through their behavior. They dance around masterwork, circle good work approvingly, ignore adequate work, and flee from poor work. Their judgment is never wrong.
    visual_aspects:
      - Miniature humanoids 2-3 inches tall with inspector's magnifying glasses
      - Dressed in tiny versions of guild master regalia
      - Expressions exaggeratedly critical or approving
      - Glow different colors based on quality assessment
      - Carry impossibly small measuring tools
    habitat:
      where: Throughout guild workshops, especially near finished work
      when: Active during quality assessment and journeyman evaluations
      why: Guild's standards made manifest; collective perfectionism given form
    behavior:
      who: Dozens scattered throughout guildhall
      what: Assess work quality through behavior and color changes
      how: Cannot be fooled; respond to objective quality, not reputation
    lore: Journeyman examinations include the Sprite Test—present your masterwork and wait for their reaction. Dancing sprites mean automatic pass. Fleeing sprites mean automatic fail. Everyone trusts their judgment more than human assessors. One noble tried bribing examiners to approve substandard work. The Sprites fled. The scandal destroyed him.

      who: Countless individual sparks forming collective innovation network
      what: Transfer insights and partial solutions between crafters
      how: Jump from mind to mind, carrying ideas across workspace
    lore: The guild's philosophy encourages this—"A rising tide lifts all boats." Competitors working on similar problems often experience the same breakthrough simultaneously via Innovation Sparks. One master locksmith was struggling with a mechanism when a spark hit her, showing a hinge design. Moments later, a carpenter across the hall shouted in triumph—he'd just solved his problem, and the solution included the exact hinge she needed.
