This is a comprehensive request to create location imagery specifications for the Masons' Guildhall based on the detailed analyst output. Let me work through this systematically.

## Key Elements from the Analysis

**Narrative Soul:** Craft elevated to civic religion—a building that teaches through its own existence. The progression from rough granite to polished marble demonstrates mastery. This is where practical knowledge becomes institutional authority.

**One-line Essence:** "Where craft becomes authority and stone teaches stone"

**Key Visual Elements:**
1. Rusticated granite plinth (~10 ft) - fortress grade base
2. String course transition to polished marble ashlar
3. Voussoired grand portal with Guild seal keystone (14 ft clear)

I'll focus on the material palette and color strategy that embodies the Guildhall's architectural narrative. The materials are carefully chosen to represent the guild's progression from raw to refined craft. Granite anchors the structure with its rugged strength, while marble and limestone elevate the façade with polished sophistication. Bronze accents and oak elements add warmth and historical depth, creating a rich sensory experience that tells the story of mastery and tradition.

The color palette moves from cool granite greys to warm hearth tones, bridging institutional authority with intimate craftsmanship. I'm wrestling with the establishing mood - between SOMBER's institutional weight and PASTORAL's soft naturalism. The building demands a sense of dignified presence that communicates both authority and subtle emotional resonance.

Mapping institutional moods reveals nuanced possibilities: SOMBER captures dramatic gravity, while PASTORAL suggests open, diffused light. The midday setting complicates the emotional landscape, pushing me to consider a carefully calibrated mood blend that communicates civic gravitas without feeling oppressive.

I'm drawn to SOMBER for the establishing shot, emphasizing institutional weight through dramatic lighting. The building's architectural progression from "fortress to temple" demands a mood that balances authority with aspiration. Each space requires strategic emotional framing - the Grand Hall demands reverential expertise, the Proving Cellar needs controlled intensity, and spaces like the Keystone Library and Hearthstone Lounge invite more intimate, contemplative atmospheres.

The lighting strategy becomes a narrative tool, transforming architectural spaces through carefully selected emotional textures.
