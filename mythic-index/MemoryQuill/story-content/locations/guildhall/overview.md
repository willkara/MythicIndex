## Quick Description
A monumental Trades Ward guildhall built to teach by example: a rusticated granite plinth (fortress‑grade base) rises to polished marble ashlar with refined orders, deep cornices, and a voussoired grand portal set with the Guild’s seal. Within the symmetric block, a double‑height Grand Hall of Works displays demonstration arches, bond patterns, and model plinths; above, the north‑lit Keystone Library and drawing vaults preserve plans, surveys, and quarry cores. Below, the “Hammer & Chisel” workshops and Proving Cellar host training and structural tests (compression, shear, wedge). Members gather in upper studios and the Hearthstone Lounge opening to a small roof cloister around a bell cote. A rear service court with jib/beam hoist admits stone and models away from the ceremonial front.
