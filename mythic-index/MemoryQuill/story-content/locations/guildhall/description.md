# Masons’ Guildhall – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Trades Ward, Waterdeep. The guildhall occupies a full city-block parcel on firm urban subgrade with historic rubble infill at the perimeter lanes. Streets crown toward center drains; prevailing sea air introduces salt and damp seasonally, but the inner city siting reduces direct storm loads.
- Site Advantages: Central access to artisan rows, quarries’ factors, and civic bureaus; ample frontage for ceremonial approach; rear service lane for stone deliveries and refuse. Elevated plinth keeps splash and street sludge off the main thresholds.
- Environmental Factors: High pedestrian pressure on market days; winter freeze‑thaw cycles on façades; summer heat buildup in upper galleries without active night‑flush routines.
- Approach Routes: Ceremonial west frontage via a grand portal; trade/service ingress on the east lane to a rear hoist court; staff entry at a porter’s wicket beside the main arch.

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Civic guild idiom—fortress‑grade base course (rusticated granite plinth) rising to polished marble ashlar with refined orders, restrained tracery, and deeply modeled cornices. Structure declares authority and longevity, with didactic stonework samples embedded in the façade.
- Primary Materials:
  - Masonry: Granite footings and plinth; marble and fine limestone ashlar above; lime mortar with pozzolanic amendment in floor beds; leaded cramps/dowels.
  - Timber/Metal: Heavy oak joists and purlins where spans demand; wrought iron tie‑bars and cramps set in lead; bronze for weather‑exposed fixings and nameplates.
  - Roofing/Glazing: Slate roof with copper/lead flashings; louvered ridge lanterns; leaded glass in high arches; iron grilles at basement vents.
- Overall Layout: Symmetric tripartite block wrapped around a central stair/hoist well. Public ceremonial rooms occupy the ground and second floors along the frontage; the basement holds training/workshops and testing bays; member lounge and roof cloister sit at the top level. A small east service court contains a wall jib‑crane and hoist hatch.

## Physical Systems & Infrastructure

### Structural Engineering
- Foundations: Stepped granite footings; perimeter French drains tied to street culvert; archive vault underpinning isolates micro‑vibration.

Canon Notes:
- [FIRM] ch24 – Masons’ Guild formally engages contemporary structural technique (letter with seal; study interest in counter‑lever method).
- [IMPLIED] – Trades Ward civic guild presence, archives of plans/surveys, arbitration function, and training/proving traditions are consistent with Waterdeep’s craft institutions and do not contradict chapters.
