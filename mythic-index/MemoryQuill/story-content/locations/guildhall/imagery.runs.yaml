Segmental brick and stone vaults on granite piers create the architecture; the clear headroom of twelve to fourteen feet allows apparatus of serious scale. The compression rig dominates: a screw-frame press that applies measured force to stone samples until they yield or hold. Nearby, the wedge test bed evaluates splitting resistance—a stone clamped in place, wedges driven with calibrated force. The shear frame tests lateral forces. The ring-test rack allows small arch assemblies to be loaded to failure, showing students exactly when and how masonry breaks. The light comes from hooded work lamps focused on the apparatus—work light, not display light. Dust-settle boxes sit on cross-vent shafts, capturing the particulate of shattered samples. The walls show old stress marks, patches where test samples were mounted and failed. This is where Grimjaw's innovations would face their ultimate validation. The compression rig doesn't care about tradition.

At the lectern dais, a master in guild robes addresses the assembly—figure generic but authoritative, gesturing toward the stonework demonstration. The gallery balconies hold senior members looking down, observing both the demonstration and the students' attention. The floor is filled with guild members: journeymen standing in attentive rows, apprentices straining to see, a few masters seated in reserved positions near the front. The demonstration arch itself shows work in progress—perhaps a voussoir being positioned, or a keystone ready to complete the curve. The test wall nearby displays the bond patterns under discussion. Model plinths hold related examples.

        SCENARIO: lecturer at dais in guild robes, demonstration arch (work in progress), assembled audience (journeymen, apprentices, masters), gallery balconies with senior observers, dramatic daylight shafts, test wall with bond patterns, model plinths, The Grand Hall alive with purpose: a lecture in progress, the demonstration arch lit by dramatic daylight shafts from high windows. At the lectern dais, a master in guild robes addresses the assembly—figure generic but authoritative, gesturing toward the stonework demonstration. The gallery balconies hold senior members looking down, observing both the demonstration and the students' attention. The floor is filled with guild members: journeymen standing in attentive rows, apprentices straining to see, a few masters seated in reserved positions near the front. The demonstration arch itself shows work in progress—perhaps a voussoir being positioned, or a keystone ready to complete the curve. The test wall nearby displays the bond patterns under discussion. Model plinths hold related examples. The space operates as designed: craft made visible, knowledge transferred in a cathedral of expertise., Narrative context: This image establishes what the Guild does and how it works—the formal transfer of knowledge through demonstration and lecture. If Grimjaw's methods were ever presented here, this is the context: assembled expertise, institutional attention, the weight of professional judgment., Wide interior shot capturing both the soaring space and the assembled audience. The lecturer should be positioned at the dais with the demonstration arch visible behind or beside. Gallery balconies with observers create the sense of hierarchical observation. The light should be dramatic—shafts from high windows illuminating the demonstration while leaving parts of the audience in relative shadow.
