creatures:
  - name: Map Moth
    description: Moths whose wing patterns display perfect cartographic maps of areas their ancestors have flown. They gather where travelers share route information, updating their collective geographic knowledge with each generation. Their wings literally chart the world.
    visual_aspects:
      - Large moths with wingspan of 4-6 inches
      - Wing patterns show detailed maps with roads, rivers, and landmarks
      - Different individuals show different regions
      - Patterns shift subtly over generations as routes change
      - Antennae quiver when geographic information is discussed
    habitat:
      where: Throughout the tavern, especially near map displays and traveler gatherings
      when: Most active during peak travel seasons
      why: Feed on geographic information and navigational knowledge
    behavior:
      who: Migrating population that cycles through; some stay for years
      what: Display living maps; appear when travelers need navigation help
      how: Collective memory spans generations; wings show cumulative knowledge
    lore: Travelers learn to watch for Map Moths. If you're planning a journey, one often lands nearby showing that exact region. Caravan leaders pay coin to sketch the moth wings' patterns—they're more current than printed maps and include details like seasonal road conditions. The innkeeper once saved a merchant from a washed-out bridge because a Map Moth landed on his cup showing the detour.

  - name: Direction Hound
    description: Ghostly hunting dog that appears to lost travelers and leads them toward safety. It doesn't always lead to their intended destination, but always to somewhere they need to be. Some believe it's the spirit of a legendary guide dog; others think it's the tavern's hospitality made manifest.
    visual_aspects:
      - Translucent mastiff with gentle, intelligent eyes
      - Glows with warm amber light, brighter in darkness
      - Paw prints visible briefly after each step, pointing direction
      - Wears spectral collar with compass rose medallion
      - Always moves at pace the follower can maintain
    habitat:
      where: Appears on roads and paths near lost travelers; vanishes at the tavern door
      when: Manifests when travelers are genuinely lost or in danger
      why: Unknown origin; serves travelers unconditionally
    behavior:
      who: Single entity reported consistently for thirty years
      what: Guides lost travelers to safety, not necessarily their intended destination
      how: Appears unbidden; patient but insistent on being followed
    lore: A merchant caught in a blizzard followed it to an unexpected cave, angry at the diversion. The cave sheltered him until the storm passed—and his original route was hit by an avalanche. A child separated from parents followed it not home, but to a Watch patrol. The Compass's owner claims it led him to this location originally; he bought the tavern because the Hound led him here.

  - name: Story Coin
    description: An ancient gold coin that passes from traveler to traveler, never spent, always given freely. Whoever holds it feels compelled to share their journey's story. It binds travelers together through shared narrative and has been circulating for over a century.
    visual_aspects:
      - Worn gold coin from an unidentifiable mint
      - Warm to the touch, retains heat from previous holder
      - Engravings too worn to read, but patterns suggest roads and paths
      - Appears in pockets and purses without explanation
      - Seems to catch light even in darkness
    habitat:
      where: Moves among travelers staying at the Compass
      when: Appears in the possession of those with stories needing to be told
      why: Enchanted to facilitate storytelling and connection
    behavior:
      who: Single coin; unknown number of enchanted duplicates or unique item
      what: Compels holder to share travel stories; passes to next storyteller
      how: Appears mysteriously; holders feel honored obligation to share and pass it
    lore: The Compass's tradition: if you find the Story Coin in your pocket, you owe the common room a tale. Hundreds have shared because of it. Some stories are grand adventures, others simple journeys. All matter. One traveler found it, shared how he left home, and connected with someone going there—they became business partners. The coin was in the new partnership contract, pressed between the pages.

  - name: Waypoint Wisp
    description: Small floating lights that chart optimal routes through the city. They appear to travelers leaving the Compass, leading them through Waterdeep's confusing streets to their destinations. Each route is efficient, safe, and scenic—they seem to know what each traveler needs to see.
    visual_aspects:
      - Soft golden light the size of a lantern flame
      - Floats at convenient viewing height, adjusts for tall and short followers
      - Pulses gently when follower falls behind
      - Warm glow that's comforting without being bright
      - Leaves faint golden trail that fades after minutes
    habitat:
      where: Originate at the Compass entrance; guide throughout Waterdeep
      when: Appear when travelers express uncertainty about navigation
      why: Extension of the tavern's hospitality into the broader city
    behavior:
      who: Appears to be unlimited supply; possibly single entity manifesting multiply
      what: Guide travelers to destinations via optimal routes
      how: Know fastest, safest, or most beautiful route depending on traveler's need
    lore: First-time visitors to Waterdeep are told: "Stay at the Wayward Compass. When you leave, tell the doorway where you're going. If a light appears, follow it." The Wisps know things—they route people past shops they need, through squares with events they'd enjoy, past other travelers they should meet. Somehow they understand not just where you're going, but where you need to be.
