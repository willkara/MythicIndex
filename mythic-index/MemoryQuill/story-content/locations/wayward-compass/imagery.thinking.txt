The user wants me to create a location_imagery.yaml for "The Wayward Compass Inn" based on the provided location analysis and source files.

Let me work through this systematically:

## 1. Extract Visual Anchor from Analysis

**Signature Elements:**
- Spinning compass needle sign with peeling paint (HIGH importance)
- Three chimney stacks drawing steadily (HIGH)
- "Toad made of timber and stone" squat shape (HIGH)
- Low blackened beams in common room (HIGH)
- Sawdust-covered floor with dark stains (HIGH)
- Shadowed corner booth with pipe smoke veil (HIGH)
- Oiled oak bar slab (HIGH)
- Leaded casement windows (MEDIUM)
- Stout oak door on strap hinges (MEDIUM)
- Mismatched tables and chairs (MEDIUM)

**Materials:**
- Oak timber frame on fitted stone plinth
- Wattle-and-daub with limewash
- Leaded glass casement windows
- Slate or wood shake roofing
- Iron strap hinges, fire furniture
- Oiled oak bar slab
- Plank floor with sawdust
- Pewter tankards

**Color Anchors:**
- Smoke-blackened timber (dark umber/black)
- Oiled oak (warm amber/honey)
- Limewash (cream/off-white)
- Stone plinth (grey)
- Pewter (grey metallic)

**Characteristic Light:**
- Day: Leaded windows filtering daylight, creating diamond patterns
- Evening: Oil lamp pools with shadow gaps between; firelight flicker
- Corner booth: Deliberately dim, pipe smoke veiling
- Bar: Brightest zone - Durja needs to read faces

## 2. Image Types to Create

From the analysis recommendations:

**PRIMARY:**
1. Establishing - Evening exterior, toad-shape, three chimneys, compass sign


2. Essence - Common room at evening peak, lamplight pools, Durja at bar
3. Beat - The confrontation moment (Company vs Black Hawks)

**SECONDARY:**
4. Zone - Shadowed corner booth (Marcus's domain)
5. Zone - Kitchen alcove (triage scene)

**OPTIONAL:**
6. Perspective - View from behind Durja's bar
7. Temporal - Morning common room (contrast)

I'll focus on capturing the inn's atmospheric tension through strategic imagery. The visual anchors reveal a space of hidden conflicts and layered narratives. Each image type will highlight different aspects of the inn's character - from its exterior silhouette to the intimate, charged interior spaces.

The primary images will establish the inn's mood: a pressure cooker of potential violence, with carefully controlled lighting and strategic spatial composition. Secondary and optional images will provide depth, showing how different characters inhabit and navigate this complex environment. I'm analyzing the inn's mood through visual and emotional lenses. The scene demands a nuanced tone - warm yet substantial, inviting yet carrying historical weight. Rembrandt-like chiaroscuro suggests depth beyond simple welcome. The exterior speaks of refuge: lamplight cutting through evening, timber and stone suggesting resilience. I'm drawn to **SOMBER** as capturing this complex atmosphere - not dark, but rich with unspoken stories, a place where travelers find sanctuary and secrets converge.

The visual palette shifts between amber warmth and muted earth tones, suggesting layers of experience absorbed into the inn's very structure. Soft light through casement windows hints at intimate human stories against a backdrop of weathered solidity. Evaluating mood options for the scene, I realize SOMBER best captures the evening crossroads inn atmosphere - its muted palette and historical weight resonating through lamplight and smoke. The common room demands a nuanced tension, balanced between warmth and potential conflict.

The confrontation pulses with kinetic energy - tactical geometry where dramatic forces intersect. Booth and alcove spaces shift between intimate shadows and protective functionality. Durja's perspective maintains steady, watchful authority.

As morning arrives, the tone softens into pastoral calm, daylight transforming the previous evening's charged environment into a gentle, honest space. I'll carefully structure the YAML, meticulously mapping out each narrative element with precision. The framework will capture the inn's essence, breaking down its spatial and temporal dynamics into a comprehensive visual blueprint. I'll ensure each zone and perspective reveals a distinct narrative layer, creating a rich, interconnected storytelling environment.
