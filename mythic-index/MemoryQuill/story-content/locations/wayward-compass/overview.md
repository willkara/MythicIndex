# The Wayward Compass Inn – Overview

## First Appearance
- Chapter: ch10 – “The Wayward Compass” [FIRM ch10]
- Supporting Vignette: ch10.5 – “Inn Talk” [FIRM ch10.5]

## Quick Description
A low‑beamed crossroads inn of timber and fitted stone—solid, smoky, and busy—squatting at the junction like a toad with three working chimneys. A peeling compass sign with a spinning needle creaks above the door. Inside: a commanding bar run under Durja’s eye, shadowed corner booths for quiet observation, and an alcove near the kitchen used for private tending and triage. [FIRM]

## Visual Summary
- Exterior & Siting: Weathered timber on stone plinth; three chimney stacks drawing steadily; open casement windows spilling lamplight and voices to the road; signboard with a wildly spinning compass needle, paint flaked but legible. [FIRM]
- Threshold: Stout oak door on strap hinges; simple wind‑baffle within to break drafts; sawdust tracked over wide, scarred plank boards. Door frequently bangs open under force when trouble arrives. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Common Room: Low blackened beams; mismatched tables and chairs with circulation aisles; lamp brackets forming pools of light; deliberate shadow pocket at a corner booth favored by watchers and deal‑makers. [FIRM]
- Bar Run: Oiled oak slab; under‑bar taps likely fed by short gravity lines from a cool cellar; pewter clink and steady polishing ritual as the room’s heartbeat. [IMPLIED/FIRM tone]
- Kitchen & Alcove: Range hearth service line through a swing door or pass; semi‑private alcove near the kitchen used for quiet work—bandages, counsel, and paid healer visits. [FIRM]
- Vertical Circulation: Narrow stair to let‑rooms above the warm side of the house; predictable creaks; shutters for night; cellar access by trap or stair behind the bar. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Atmosphere: Stale ale, roasting meat, pipe smoke, and road dust; conversation dips to whispers when predators enter; patrons press to walls; neutrality maintained by presence and policy. [FIRM]

## Functional Notes
- Chokepoints & Sightlines: Bar to door command line; corner booth with view of thresholds; side passage flanking move via kitchen pass; alcove near kitchen provides semi‑screened work zone. [FIRM/IMPLIED]
- Daily Rhythm: Midday trade crowd, evening peak under lamplight, quiet hours upstairs; floors re‑sanded as needed; cellar checks aligned with cask turnover. [IMPLIED]
- Neutral‑House Protocol: Trouble redirected or diffused; information often outmuscles steel; healer summoned for paying customers; staff preserve order and circulation. [FIRM]
- Horse & Wagon Interface: Hitch rail and water trough off frontage; rear lane intake for casks and refuse to keep the public floor clear. [IMPLIED]
