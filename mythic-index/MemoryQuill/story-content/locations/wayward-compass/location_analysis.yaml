  narrative_soul: |
    The Wayward Compass is neutral ground made architecture—a crossroads inn where information outmuscles steel and presence determines outcome. Here, civilized predators circle each other in pools of lamplight, reading capability in posture and formation rather than drawn blades. It's where the Last Light Company first demonstrates what makes them different: not that they can fight, but that they don't have to. The dark stains in the sawdust aren't warnings—they're history, absorbed and managed like everything else under Durja's watchful command.
    
  one_line_essence: "Neutral arena where information defeats violence"
  
  symbolic_weight:
    primary_symbol: "The spinning compass needle—directionless, pointing everywhere, marking a place between destinations where choices are made"
    supporting_symbols:
      - "The 'toad' shape—patient, squat, watching, waiting"
      - "Dark stains in sawdust—violence absorbed into the structure, managed not celebrated"
      - "Three chimneys drawing steadily—stability maintained despite external chaos"
      - "Lamplight pools and shadow pockets—knowledge controlled, revealed selectively"
      - "The bar as command position—authority through presence, not force"
    thematic_tensions:
      - "Neutral ground vs. simmering violence"
      - "Information as weapon vs. physical force"
      - "Crossroads uncertainty vs. Durja's absolute control"
      - "Public commons vs. private observation"
      - "Healing space adjacent to bloodstained floor"

  transformation_arc: |
    The Wayward Compass doesn't physically change—it's the constant, the stage. What transforms is what happens on that stage: the balance of power when the Company enters, the moment when tactical discipline proves more formidable than predatory aggression, and Kira's trajectory from victim bleeding in an alcove to potential ally. The inn witnesses a shift in reputation—after ch10, word spreads about the mercenaries who controlled the room without drawing steel. The building endures; the stories told about it change.

physical_truth:
  construction_style: "Practical crossroads vernacular—oak timber frame on fitted stone plinth, low eaves, three masonry chimneys, limewash over wattle-and-daub infill"
  primary_materials:
    - "Seasoned oak (posts, tie beams, bar slab)"
    - "Fitted stone (plinth, chimney stacks)"
    - "Wattle-and-daub (infill panels)"
    - "Leaded glass (casement windows)"
    - "Slate or wood shake (roofing, implied)"
    - "Iron (strap hinges, fire furniture)"
  scale_impression: "Squat and solid—'like a toad made of timber and stone'—commanding the junction through presence rather than height"
  
  visual_signature: |
    The peeling compass sign with its wildly spinning needle creaking above a stout oak door. Low blackened beams pressing down over a smoky common room where mismatched furniture fills the space between pools of lamplight. Three chimney stacks drawing steadily against the sky, smoke curling upward like the building is breathing. The sawdust floor with its darker patches where history has been absorbed.
    
  sound_signature: |
    The baseline: pewter tankards clinking, chair legs scraping, murmured conversation bouncing off low beams. The spike: door slamming open when predators enter, the sudden hush that follows. The constant: hearth crackle, range clatter from the kitchen, the sign creaking in wind outside. The tell: predictable stair creaks, Durja's voice cutting through when tone needs adjustment.
    
  scent_signature: |
    Stale ale and fresh pipe smoke layer over roasting meat from the kitchen. Road dust and sawdust mix underfoot. Wood smoke and lamp oil create a warm, lived-in base note. When the kitchen door swings, hot grease and herbs cut through briefly. The booth where Marcus sits carries an extra veil of tobacco smoke, deliberate and obscuring.
    
  tactile_signature: |
    The oiled smoothness of the bar slab under your palm. Grain-scored tabletops rough with years of use. Sawdust grit shifting under boot soles. Air thickened by smoke, warm near the hearth, drafty by the door despite the baffle. The sticky residue on pewter tankards from hands before yours.

  light_character: |
    Controlled pools and deliberate shadows. Oil lamps and wall sconces create islands of warm light around tables, leaving gaps of darkness between. The bar stays brighter—Durja needs to read faces. The corner booth barely catches any lamplight, its shadow deepened by pipe smoke. Firelight from the hearth adds flicker and warmth near one wall. Leaded windows admit gray daylight by afternoon, transform to black mirrors reflecting lamplight by evening. The kitchen pass glows with range-fire orange when the door swings.
    
  weather_influence: |
    In fair weather: windows cracked open, sound and lamplight spilling to the road, the compass sign creaking its eternal indecision. In storms: shutters latched, the interior grows closer and warmer, threshold wet with tracked-in mud requiring extra sawdust. In winter: frost patterns on leaded panes, glass fogging from body heat, drafts sneaking past the baffle despite its best efforts.

contextual_place:
  region: "Crossroads junction beyond Waterdeep's direct patrol radius"
  neighborhood_character: "Trade road intersection—constant caravan traffic, pack trains, mounted riders. Not lawless but self-policed through commercial necessity and neutral-house protocol. The kind of place where business requires trust, and trust requires everyone behaving."

    - name: "From the main trade road"
      description: "The inn resolves from road dust—three chimneys first against the sky, then the squat timber-and-stone mass, then the creaking compass sign. Open casements spill voices and lamplight onto the packed-dirt apron. Horses at the hitch rail, water trough catching sky reflection."

      description: "The junction opens up, the inn anchoring the crossroads like it grew there. Wagon ruts converge toward the apron. The sign's spinning needle visible even before you can read the peeling letters."

  spatial_relationship: "The inn commands the junction by occupying its center—all roads lead past it. The building doesn't need height because it has position. Everything passes through here, and Durja sees it all."

    physical_description: |
      A stout oak door (~4 ft wide) on iron strap hinges, set in a stone-silled frame beneath low eaves. Inside, a simple vestibule baffle—angled screen or bench arrangement—arrests both draft and direct line-of-sight into the common room. Stone pavers at the threshold prevent mud tracking. The door itself shows wear from years of varied entries, including the forceful kind that makes it bang against its stops.

      An oiled oak slab on sturdy trestle carcase, decades of use showing in the smooth patina. Under-bar shelves hold glassware, towels, and—likely—items for enforcement. Tap heads connect via short gravity lines to cellar casks below. Pewter tankards hang from hooks; wash basin sits within reach. The bar runs nearly the wall's length, creating a staff lane behind where only Durja's people move. This is command position: elevated by inches, backed by wall, facing everything.
      
    narrative_function: "The control center of the Wayward Compass. From here, Durja maintains neutral-house protocol through presence, voice, and the implicit threat of what's under the bar. The room's heartbeat—pewter clink, steady polishing—originates here."

    physical_description: |
      A loose arrangement of mismatched tables and chairs—some trestle, some four-leg, none matching their neighbors. Circulation aisles thread between, maintained by staff for service lanes and emergency egress. The floor is planked boards under a perpetual sawdust layer, darker patches marking where past altercations left their residue. Lamp brackets on posts create pools of light, leaving gaps of shadow between. This is where the crowd compresses—or scatters to walls when predators enter.
      
    narrative_function: "The arena where capability is demonstrated through positioning. When the Black Hawks spread to dominate, they fill this space. When the Company counters, they control the chokepoints around it. The patrons who press to walls during confrontations are the audience; the table field is the stage."

    location_within: "Corner of common room, set into deep alcove recess"
    
    physical_description: |
      A booth cut into the room's corner with a deep reveal creating natural shadow. Partial screening—perhaps a half-wall or worn curtain—adds another layer of visual obstruction. The seating wraps around, with back to walls, offering clear angles on door, bar, and table field. Lamplight barely reaches here; what light exists filters through deliberate pipe smoke. The furnishings are slightly better than the common chairs—age and occupation have worn the wood smooth with a patina that speaks of privilege earned through knowing when to watch and when to speak.
      
    narrative_function: "The observation post. This is where information brokers conduct business, where Marcus watches from behind his pipe smoke veil, where the real power in the room reads everything without being read.

    physical_description: |
      A small alcove carved from the space near the kitchen door, partially screened from the common room. Proximity to the range means hot water is always available; the clear floor space allows for emergency work. A simple bench or cot can be staged here. The light is functional—shielded lamp to prevent interference with kitchen pass—and the acoustics are dampened by the kitchen noise bleeding through. Not comfortable, but efficient. The kind of space that becomes what it needs to be: counsel room, triage station, healer's office.
      
    narrative_function: "Where healing happens away from the spectacle of the common room. This is where Kira receives treatment, where wounds are dressed and hard conversations held in something approaching privacy.

      A functional zone rather than a room—the threshold between front-of-house and back-of-house. Through swinging door or pass hatch, heat and light from the range escape in bursts. Cook and scullery activity audible: pan clatter, shouted orders, the roar of the range fire.
