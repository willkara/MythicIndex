# NARRATIVE SOUL - Thematic Essence for AI Generation
# ============================================================================
narrative_soul: |
  The Wayward Compass is a toad made of timber and stone squatting at the
  crossroads where information is more dangerous than drawn steel. Under Durja's
  broken-tusked authority, this low-beamed, smoky sanctuary maintains neutrality
  through presence and policy—trouble is redirected or diffused, secrets are
  traded over dark wine, and the murmur never fully dies even when roads go
  quiet. The spinning compass sign creaks above a stout door that bangs open
  under force; inside, sawdust-covered floors remember past blood in darker
  stains, mismatched chairs cluster around tables lit by calculated pools of
  lamplight, and the shadowed corner booth hides watchers who see everything
  while seeming to look at nothing. When predators enter, conversation drops to
  whispers and patrons press to walls—but sometimes a silk-voiced stranger proves
  more dangerous than filed tusks, his words cutting through tension like warm
  honey through ice. This is a place where a pre-Spellplague coin gleams with
  empire-old promise, where a name dropped right can hit like a crossbow bolt,
  and where the lantern on certain tables burns absolutely steady no matter who
  opens the door.

one_line_essence: "A crossroads inn where information outweighs steel—neutral ground maintained by presence, policy, and Durja's broken-tusked authority."
