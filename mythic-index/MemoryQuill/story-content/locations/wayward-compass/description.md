# The Wayward Compass – Physical Description

## Geography & Site Analysis
- Location & Terrain: Crossroads inn positioned at a junction of trade roads beyond Waterdeep’s direct patrol radius. Slight crown to the road for drainage; packed dirt apron with stone pavers at the threshold to limit mud tracking. [IMPLIED]
- Site Advantages: Constant footfall from caravans and riders; good visibility to approaching traffic; cross‑breezes available through opposing windows for smoke purge. [IMPLIED]
- Environmental Factors:
  - Weather Exposure: Spring dust and summer heat; winter sleet and crosswinds. Three chimney stacks stabilize draught and reduce backflow under gusts. [FIRM ch10/IMPLIED]
  - Street Loads: Wagon ruts and hoof impact; threshold pavers distribute point loads, protecting sill. [IMPLIED]
- Approach Routes:
  - Main Road Frontage: Primary public entry from street apron; hitch rail and water trough set off to the side for horses. [IMPLIED]
  - Rear Service Lane: Cask deliveries and refuse outflow; discrete staff access to kitchen and cellar. [IMPLIED]

## Architectural Overview
- Construction Style: Practical crossroads vernacular—oak timber frame on a fitted stone plinth; low eaves; limewash on base infill; three masonry chimneys expressing hearths for common room, kitchen range, and back chamber. Interior dominated by low beams and smoke‑stained boards. [FIRM ch10/IMPLIED]
- Primary Materials:
  - Structure: Seasoned oak posts, tie beams, joists; pegged mortise‑and‑tenon joinery; stone footings. [IMPLIED]
  - Envelope: Wattle/daub infill panels with lime finish; leaded panes at street windows; stout oak door on strap hinges. [IMPLIED]
  - Interior: Oiled oak bar, plank floor with sawdust layer; mismatched chairs/trestles; pewter tankards; iron fire furniture. [FIRM ch10/IMPLIED]
- Construction Methods: Post‑and‑beam bays (~8–10 ft) with brace frames; hearth stacks in brick/stone with clay tile liners; under‑bar trap and gravity feed from cellar casks. [IMPLIED]
- Overall Layout: Street → wind‑baffle at threshold → Common Room (bar on controlling wall; field of tables; shadowed corner booths) → side passage to Kitchen/Scullery and “alcove near the kitchen” → stairs up to rooms → trap/stair down to Cellar → rear service exit to lane. [FIRM ch10/IMPLIED]

## Detailed Structural Analysis

### 1) Street Frontage & Threshold
- Dimensions & Scale: Door width ~4 ft; heavy plank leaves; lintel at ~6 ft 8 in under low beam; two or three leaded casements venting to street. [IMPLIED]
- Construction Details: Stone sill and two courses of plinth; door on iron strap hinges with through‑bolts; simple vestibule baffle (screen wall or angled bench) to arrest draft and line‑of‑sight. [IMPLIED]
- Distinctive Features: Hanging sign board—compass rose with spinning needle, paint peeling but legible; swinging in wind. Low, stocky massing—“toad made of timber and stone.” [FIRM ch10]
- Condition: Sound and serviceable; smoke patina at eaves; door frequently bangs under forceful entries. [FIRM ch10]

### 2) Common Room (Bar Axis & Table Field)
- Dimensions & Scale: ~28–36 ft wide by 22–30 ft deep; head height 7–7.5 ft to underside of beams; capacity 30–40 patrons at peak. [IMPLIED]
- Construction Details:
  - Bar: Oiled oak slab on trestle carcase; under‑bar shelves, wash basin, and tap heads tied to cellar casks via short run gravity lines. [IMPLIED]
  - Floor: Planked boards with permanent sawdust layer to soak spills and blood—areas of darker stain record past altercations. [FIRM ch10]
  - Seating: Mismatched tables and chairs; two to four recessed corner booths designed for privacy and observation. One booth notably shadowed and favored by information brokers. [FIRM ch10/ch10.5]
- Layout Configuration: Bar anchors a long wall with clear staff lane behind; table field loosely ordered with circulation aisles; sightlines from bar and booths control approaches. [IMPLIED]
- Distinctive Features: Smoke haze under beams; lamp brackets creating pools of light with deliberate shadow zones; pewter clink and steady bar polish as rhythms of the house. [FIRM ch10]
- Physical Condition: Robust but worn; chair repairs evident; beam faces scarred and darkened by smoke. [FIRM ch10/IMPLIED]

### 3) Shadowed Corner Booths (Observation Recess)
- Geometry: Deep reveal alcove with partial screen/backing creating a dark pocket; pipe smoke lingers; lamplight barely reaches. [FIRM ch10.5]
- Purpose: Discreet vantage for surveillance, negotiation, and private counsel; acoustic dampening via soft furnishings and beam baffles. [FIRM ch10.5/IMPLIED]
- Security: Angled seating with wall at back; direct view to door and bar; foot clearance to avoid table collision during rapid egress. [IMPLIED]

### 4) Kitchen & Scullery (with Alcove Near Kitchen)
- Components: Range hearth (chimney stack #2), prep table, scullery sink with bucket chain to rear; swinging door/pass hatch to common room. [IMPLIED]
- Alcove Near Kitchen: Semi‑private corner with partial separation used for triage and healer access; proximity to hot water and clear floor space. [FIRM ch10]
- Ventilation: Flue draw; clerestory vent or louvered slit to purge heat and steam. [IMPLIED]

### 5) Stairs & Rooms (Upper Floor)
- Stairs: Narrow wooden stair (~3 ft clear), close stringer; handrail; creak points predictable. [IMPLIED]
- Rooms: Simple let rooms above the bar half for warmth; shuttered windows; shared latrine down the hall; low sloped ceilings at eaves. [IMPLIED]
- Use Pattern: Short stays; neutral policy enforced—no faction insignia displayed in windows; quiet hours observed by staff patrol. [IMPLIED]

### 6) Cellar & Cask Storage
- Access: Trap behind bar or short stair; barred hatch for deliveries from rear; cool, packed earth or flagged floor. [IMPLIED]
- Storage: Upright casks on racks; tap lines short to bar; shelving for wine, pewter, lamp oil, and sawdust bins. [IMPLIED]
- Safety: Sand bins; water butt; lantern station with covers; “no open flame” during cask changes. [IMPLIED]

### 7) Rear Service Lane & Yard
- Geometry: Narrow lane; refuse barrels; cask cradle; hitch point for dray. [IMPLIED]
- Functions: Intake/outflow separate from patrons; night‑bar latch line; spill wash area draining to soakaway. [IMPLIED]
