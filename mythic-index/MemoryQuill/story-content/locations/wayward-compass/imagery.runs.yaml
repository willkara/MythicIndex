The seating wraps around, backs to walls, offering clear sightlines to door and bar while remaining nearly invisible itself. Lamplight barely reaches here; what illumination exists filters through a deliberate veil of pipe smoke that hangs in the still air.

        SCENARIO: deep shadow despite ambient lamplight, pipe smoke lingering like deliberate screen, clear sightlines to door and bar implied, worn wood smoothed by years of watchers, partial screening enhancing concealment, figure present but barely resolved, eyes catching distant light, The corner booth recedes into deliberate shadow—a deep alcove cut into the room's geometry with partial screening adding another layer of concealment. The seating wraps around, backs to walls, offering clear sightlines to door and bar while remaining nearly invisible itself. Lamplight barely reaches here; what illumination exists filters through a deliberate veil of pipe smoke that hangs in the still air. A figure sits within—Marcus—barely more than a shape with eyes that catch distant lamplight. The furnishings show age and privilege: wood worn smooth by years of watchers, slightly better quality than the common chairs. This is where information lives., Narrative context: Marcus's surveillance post—where ch10.5 unfolds. The booth sees everything the bar misses. While Durja controls the floor, information brokers control what happens after people leave it.
