  Vignette 1: Inn Talk (New Vignette - After Chapter 12)

   * Setting: "The Wayward Compass" Inn common room, late evening, shortly after the Company's encounter
     with the Black Hawks and Marcus. The Company members are in their alcove, but the general inn patrons
     are the focus.
   * Characters: Inn patrons (travelers, merchants, local farmers), Durja (the formidable orc innkeeper).
   * Content:
       * Merchant 1 (to another, hushed): "Did you see that? Those Black Hawks, bold as brass, then that
         fellow just... talked them away. Like they were naughty children." (Disbelief, awe)
       * Merchant 2: "Aye, and the Company. The Last Light, they call themselves. Heard they just pulled a
         family from a collapsed mine up north. And that tracker lass, she found a lost caravan in a
         blizzard!" (Spreading rumors, growing reputation)
       * Local Farmer: "And the dwarf! He just stood there, axe in hand, like he was waiting for a mountain
         to move. Never seen such calm." (Admiration)
       * Traveler: "And the scarred woman... she just looked at them, and they backed down. There's power
         in that." (Mystique, fear/respect)
       * Durja (wiping counter, gruffly): "They pay their tab. And they keep the peace. That's all I care
         about." (Pragmatism, but a hint of approval)
       * Young Bard (strumming lute softly): "A tale for the ages, eh? The Company of the Last Light,
         bringing justice to the roads, and mystery to the inns." (Already composing a song)
       * Atmosphere: Low murmurs, clinking mugs, the occasional burst of laughter or exclamation. A sense
         of immediate, fresh gossip spreading, shaping the Company's legend in real-time.
   * Reinforces: The immediate impact of the Company's actions, how their reputation is being built through
     word-of-mouth, and the diverse ways people interpret their deeds. It also subtly introduces the idea of
      bards spreading their fame.

  Vignette 2: The Mess Hall Buzz (Revised)

   * Setting: The Westwall Watchpost mess hall, late morning. The air is thick with the smell of fresh
     coffee and Mistress Elba's (slightly burnt) breakfast. Most of the Company and some Watchmen are
     present.
   * Characters: Veyra, Thorne, Aldwin, Grimjaw, Vera, Fayne, Halden, Kelen, Darric, Venn, Finn, Mistress
     Elba.
   * Content:
       * Grimjaw (booming, mid-mouthful): "And then the little runt, Thomas, he goes 'Ma! Not in front
         of—ow, ow, ow!'" (Mimicking, laughter)
       * Venn (wiping tears of laughter): "I swear, Commander, your laugh that day... it nearly melted the
         snow! Never thought I'd see it." (Teasing, lighthearted)
       * Veyra (a small, genuine smile): "It was... unexpected. Like finding a blizzard in July." (Rare
         moment of levity)
       * Aldwin (gently): "A reminder that even in the gravest situations, there is room for absurdity. And
         young love." (Philosophical, amused)
       * Halden: "Still, a full winter rescue for a boy and his sweetheart. My medical supplies took a
         beating." (Feigned grumbling)
       * Fayne: "But the data, Halden! The logistical challenges of a non-emergency winter deployment!
         Invaluable for future planning!" (Enthusiastic, analytical)
       * Mistress Elba (entering with a fresh pot): "Invaluable for my pantry, you mean! You lot eat like a
         plague of locusts. And don't even get me started on the dwarf's 'special' requests for his tea
         ceremonies." (Good-natured complaining)
       * Grimjaw: "A dwarf needs his comforts, woman! And your coffee tastes like boiled boots!" (Playful
         retort)
       * Thorne (to Veyra, quietly): "They're settling in. This feels... right." (Observing the
         camaraderie)
       * Vera (to Echo, who's perched nearby): "See, Echo? Even humans can be amusing when they're not
         trying to freeze to death." (Dry wit)
       * Atmosphere: Clatter of plates, boisterous laughter, friendly banter. A sense of a growing,
         slightly dysfunctional but deeply bonded family.
   * Reinforces: The Company's internal dynamics, their shared experiences (including the absurd ones), the
     growing sense of "found family," and the underlying warmth despite their serious missions. It shows
     their humanity and how they cope with the stresses of their work.

  Vignette 3: The Quartermaster's Corner

   * Setting: Fayne's cramped corner in the barracks, late afternoon. Piles of new supplies (ropes, canvas,
     tools) are stacked precariously. Fayne is hunched over a ledger, sketching in a notebook.
   * Characters: Fayne, perhaps Halden passing by.
   * Content:
       * Fayne (muttering to self): "Fifty feet of silk, seventy of hemp... where in the nine hells am I
         going to put a new cauldron? Elba's going to have my hide." (Frustration, logistical challenge)
       * Halden (peering over shoulder): "Still trying to fit a dragon into a teacup, Fayne? Heard you got
         some new medical supplies from Stonebridge. Any chance of a proper infirmary soon? This 'curtained
          corner' isn't exactly sterile." (Practical concern, shared frustration)
       * Fayne (sighing, gesturing to sketches): "Working on it, Halden. Got some ideas for modular
         storage, maybe a collapsible field clinic. But it all needs... space. And a proper foundation."
         (Forward-thinking, hinting at the Bastion)
       * Atmosphere: The rustle of parchment, the scratch of a quill, the occasional clatter of a dropped
         tool. A sense of organized chaos and the constant struggle against physical limitations.
   * Reinforces: The Company's rapid growth, the strain on existing resources, the need for a new
     headquarters, and Fayne's role as a pragmatic problem-solver.

  Vignette 4: The Training Yard

   * Setting: The Westwall Watchpost training yard, early evening. The last light of day casts long
     shadows. Thorne is observing a small group of Watchmen practicing.
   * Characters: Thorne, Sarge (the orc sergeant), a few Watchmen.
   * Content:
       * Sarge (to Watchmen): "Again! Faster! You move like a pregnant owlbear! Commander Thornwake
         wouldn't hesitate, why are you?" (Gruff instruction, high standards)
       * Thorne (to Sarge): "They're adapting, Sarge. Not everyone has the Commander's... instincts. Or
         Master Grimjaw's patience with stone." (Understanding, acknowledging new influences)
       * Sarge: "Hmph. Instincts. Give me a good shield wall any day. But I'll grant you, the dwarf's got
         a way with timber. And the halfling's teas... they do wonders for a bruised ego after a spar."
         (Reluctant acceptance, humor)
       * Watchman (to another, whispered): "Heard the Commander can make a man's shadow fight him. Best
         not to cross her." (Whispers, awe, a touch of fear)
       * Atmosphere: The clang of practice weapons, grunts of effort, crisp commands. A sense of
         heightened discipline and the blending of traditional Watch training with the Company's
         specialized skills.
   * Reinforces: The integration of the Company's methods into the Watchpost, the impact of the new
     specialists on training, and the growing respect (and slight apprehension) for Veyra's capabilities.

  Vignette 5: The Lantern's Glow

   * Setting: Veyra's small room in the Watchpost, late night. The only light comes from her ever-present
     lantern.
   * Characters: Veyra, perhaps Thorne briefly.
   * Content:
       * Veyra (to herself, tracing the scar on her cheek): "A lock without a key... a fortress waiting.
         And a city that whispers of gold and shadows." (Contemplation, linking recent events to her
         personal mission)
       * Thorne (from the doorway, having just entered): "Still burning the midnight oil, Commander? Or
         just keeping the light on?" (Gentle concern, shared understanding)
       * Veyra: "Both. The whispers are getting louder, Thorne. About the Hand. About the spring shipment.
         Marcus wasn't just selling information, he was showing us a path." (Focus, determination, hinting
         at future plot)
       * Thorne: "A path to a fortress. And a fight."
       * Veyra: "A fight we're ready for. Now more than ever." (Quiet resolve)
       * Atmosphere: The soft glow of the lantern, the quiet of the night, the weight of thought. A sense
         of personal reflection and strategic planning.
   * Reinforces: Veyra's personal drive, the connection between the "Lock" and the Silent Hand, the
     strategic importance of the Bastion, and the deepening partnership between Veyra and Thorne.
