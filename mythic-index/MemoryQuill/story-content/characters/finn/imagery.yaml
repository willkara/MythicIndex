appearance: "Finn is a young human male possessing a lean, physically fit build developed through arduous stable work and rigorous self-taught ranger training. His earnest face is framed by unassuming brown hair, and his hazel eyes, once clouded with youthful nervousness, now frequently hold a steady gaze of emerging quiet confidence. Practicality defines his attire; he is typically clad in a simple, worn leather tunic and sturdy breeches that serve him equally well among horses or on the battlefield. As the company's dedicated tactical archer, a well-used bow and a heavily stocked quiver of arrows are his constant companions, visibly marking his transition from a simple animal caretaker to a respected defender. While he bears no striking scars or tattoos, his hands likely show the calluses of both archery and his woodcarving hobby, reflecting his dual nature as a gentle soul and a determined fighter."
