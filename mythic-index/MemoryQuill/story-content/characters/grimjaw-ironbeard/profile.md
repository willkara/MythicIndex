## Personal Details
- **Habits**: Sharing dwarven spirits with warnings about their potency
- **Hobbies**: Collecting rare ore samples, maintaining his tools
- **Personal Quarters**: A low-ceilinged, roughly hewn room deep within the Bastion's foundations. The air is cool and smells of damp earth and stone. One wall is left as natural, unworked bedrock, with a thin trickle of clean water running down its face into a small stone basin. The bed is a wide stone slab covered in thick, warm furs. This is his personal delve, a connection to his home and his past. He feels most at peace here, surrounded by the comforting weight of the earth. The room is lit by magical lanterns that cast a warm, golden glow, mimicking the light of a dwarven mine. The walls are decorated with antique, masterfully crafted mining tools and shelves displaying his personal collection of geological finds—a quartz crystal cluster that pulses with a faint light, a vein of raw, unpolished silver ore. A loose stone in the bedrock wall pivots to reveal a hidden alcove containing a small, perpetually cool cask of potent dwarven ale, which he shares only with those he truly trusts.
- **Likes**: Practical solutions, sharing wisdom through stories, watching younger members grow
- **Dislikes**: Waste of resources, unnecessary risks, being sidelined due to age
- **Fears**: Possibly fear of becoming truly obsolete or unable to contribute

## Combat & Tactics
- **Primary Weapon**: "Tremor" - a masterwork hybrid war-hammer/mining pick forged for him by his clan to honor his status as a master miner. It is both a symbol of his station and the perfect tool for his trade.
- **Secondary Tools**: Reinforced gauntlets for close-quarters grappling and structural work
- **Armor**: Heavy leather mining gear reinforced with steel plates at vital points - practical protection that doubles as work clothing
- **Specialized Gear**: Collapsible supports, emergency rope, and mining charges adapted for combat demolition
- **Fighting Style**: Immovable anchor - controls battlefield space through sheer presence and defensive positioning
- **Signature Move**: "Mountain's Judgment" - overhead strike with Tremor that can shatter stone or crush armor
- **Combat Philosophy**: "Stand behind me. Nothing gets through" - protection over aggression
- **Tactical Role**: Physical barrier who creates safe zones while providing structural expertise

### Future Equipment Development (Post-Cid Partnership)
- **Enhanced Tremor**: Cid will eventually get her hands on Tremor for some... "unauthorized" upgrades, much to Grimjaw's initial chagrin and eventual appreciation.

## Psychological Response Matrix
- **In Crisis**: Becomes the physical and emotional anchor point for the team, provides steady leadership through calm presence
- **During Negotiation**: Stands as silent, imposing protection while offering practical wisdom when asked
- **Moral Dilemma**: Defers to Veyra's judgment but offers perspective based on decades of life experience
- **Team Conflict**: Mediates through paternal wisdom, often suggesting arm wrestling to settle minor disputes
- **Under Personal Attack**: Laughs off insults with "Heard worse from better" while mentally assessing if protection is needed
- **In Victory**: Immediately ensures everyone eats properly and gets rest - caretaker instincts activate

## Voice & Dialogue Patterns
- **Speech Style**: Deep, rumbling bass voice that speaks slowly but with great weight behind each word
- **Signature Phrases**: 
  - "Rocks don't lie, people do"
  - "Proper foundations prevent poor structures"
  - "This'll either solve your problems or make you forget them" (offering his flask)
- **Mining Metaphors**: Uses geological and engineering terms for everything - relationships have "load-bearing points," plans need "proper support beams"
- **Example Dialogue**: "This plan's got cracks running through it. We shore it up with backup plans, or the whole thing collapses when pressure hits."
- **Paternal Voice**: Warm undertone when speaking to younger team members, gruff exterior hiding deep care
- **Emotional Tells**: Strokes beard when thinking, plants feet wide when making important points

## Notes
- Achieved everything he set out to do as a master miner before joining the Company
- Could have transitioned to comfortable clan elder roles but wanted more active purpose
- Reputation as "the old dwarf who never loses anyone" during mine safety consultant days
- Finding purpose in his later years through rescuing people rather than extracting minerals
- Has found a chosen family in the Last Light Company while maintaining clan connections

### Public Perception
