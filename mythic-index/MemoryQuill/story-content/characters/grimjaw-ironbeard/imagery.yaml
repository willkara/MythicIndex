appearance: "Grimjaw Ironbeard is a powerfully built, stocky dwarf whose weathered face, marked with deep lines and wrinkles, shows his advanced age. His thick, voluminous beard and hair are a mix of iron-grey and white, intricately braided and heavily adorned with numerous small metal charms, beads, and miniature tools. He has dark, deep-set eyes beneath bushy grey brows, and his skin is tanned and leathery. He wears practical, heavy dark brown leather armor, including reinforced shoulder pauldrons and forearm vambraces, with a wide leather belt holding various pouches around his waist. In one sturdy, calloused hand, he holds a large, iron-bound wooden cask, while the other rests firmly on the handle of a massive war hammer. He embodies the essence of a wise, rugged dwarven elder, a master miner and warrior who is both formidable and paternal."
