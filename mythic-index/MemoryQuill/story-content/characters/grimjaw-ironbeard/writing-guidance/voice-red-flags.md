# Grimjaw Ironbeard - Voice Red Flags

**Purpose:** Common voice violations and antipatterns to avoid.

These are patterns that break Grimjaw's established voice, signaling need for immediate revision.

---

## Critical Red Flags (Voice-Breaking)

### ❌ Over-Formal Speech

**Problem:** Grimjaw is casual (31% contractions - highest). Formality completely breaks voice.

**Example Violation:**
> "It is my considered assessment that the fortification strategy requires modification due to structural inadequacies."

**Why Wrong:**
- Zero contractions (should be 25-35%)
- Formal register (wrong for gruff dwarf)
- "inadequacies" clinical language (wrong for practical engineer)
- Completely loses personality

**Correct Version:**
> "Bah. That plan's got holes bigger than mountain passes. These supports won't hold under siege."

---

### ❌ Flowery or Abstract Language

**Problem:** Grimjaw speaks in practical terms and stone metaphors. Flowery language violates voice.

**Example Violation:**
> "The beauty of the fortress lies in its harmonious architectural lines and the graceful way it rises against the sunset."

**Why Wrong:**
- "Beauty," "harmonious," "graceful" - aesthetic language (not Grimjaw)
- No practical detail
- No stone metaphor
- No personality

**Correct Version:**
> "Aye, the fortress rises solid. Good stone work here, here, and here. Whoever built this understood pressure points."

### ❌ Missing Experience Citations in Teaching Moments

**Problem:** Teaching is Grimjaw's method. Teaching WITHOUT experience citations is a red flag.

**Example Violation:**
A major teaching dialogue with zero citations like "Trust someone who's..." or "Sixty years of..." or "Three fortresses..."

**Why Wrong:**
- Authority comes from experience
- Without citations, advice sounds generic
- Loses distinctiveness

**Correction:**
Insert experience markers:
- "Trust someone who's watched three different fortresses burn..."
- "Sixty years of building tells me..."
- "Back when I was your age..."

---

### ❌ Missing "Bah" or "Aye" in Appropriate Contexts

**Problem:** These signature markers are absent from natural dialogue.

**Example Violation:**
Grimjaw dialogue with no "Bah" interjections or "Aye" affirmations across multiple paragraphs.

**Why Wrong:**
- "Bah" is signature dismissive opener
- "Aye" is signature affirmation
- Absence loses distinctiveness

**Correction:**
- Opening dismissal: "Bah. [Statement]"
- Agreement: "Aye, that's the problem..."
- Multiple dialogues should hit both markers

---

### ❌ Contractions Under 20%

**Problem:** Grimjaw has 31% contractions (highest character). Under 20% suggests wrong voice.

**Example Violation:**
Dialogue with "I am," "you are," "it is," "they are" instead of contractions.

**Why Wrong:**
- Loses casual gruff tone
- Sounds formal and wrong
- Grimjaw is the MOST casual character

**Correction:**
Maximize natural contractions:
- "I am" → "I'm"
- "you are" → "you're"
- "it is" → "it's"
- "they are" → "they're"
- "will not" → "won't"

## Moderate Red Flags (Revision Recommended)

### ⚠️ Under 12 Words/Line in Teaching Moments

**Problem:** Grimjaw teaches through full explanation (18.7 words baseline). Under 12 words in teaching loses context.

**Example:**
Grimjaw teaching moment with sentences consistently 6-8 words.

**Why Problematic:**
- Loses explanatory depth
- More Veyra's economy than Grimjaw's storytelling
- Incomplete teaching

**Correction:** Expand teaching explanations:
- "Bah. Gate placement wrong." → "Bah. Corner placement's a young soldier's mistake. When the gate falls—and gates always fall—you want the oil here."

---

### ⚠️ Missing Stone/Bedrock Metaphors

**Problem:** Stone metaphors are Grimjaw's signature (rocks, foundation, avalanches, mountains).

**Example:**
Dialogue with zero stone/earth imagery across multiple exchanges.

**Why Problematic:**
- Loses character-specific lexicon
- Makes him sound generic
- Removes engineering/dwarf connection

**Correction:** Add natural stone metaphors:
- Stability: "That's built on bedrock principles."
- Failure: "It'll crack like an avalanche waiting to happen."
- Doubt: "Can't trust it - rocks don't lie, people do."

---

### ⚠️ "Young Soldier's Mistake" Frame Missing in Teaching

**Problem:** "[X] is a young soldier's mistake" is signature teaching frame (3 instances in analysis).

**Example:**
Grimjaw teaching without this characteristic frame.

**Why Problematic:**
- Loses distinctive teaching method
- Makes advice sound generic
- Wrong authority marker

**Correction:** Use teaching frame:
- "Gate placement is a young soldier's mistake."
- "Standing exposed like that is a young soldier's mistake."
- "That wall angle is a young soldier's mistake."

## Context-Specific Red Flags

### In Teaching Moments

❌ **No experience citations**
- "I think that's wrong" → "Trust someone who's watched three fortresses burn - it's wrong"

❌ **Under 15 words average**
- Loses explanatory context

❌ **Missing stone metaphors**
- No bedrock, foundation, or stability references

### In Combat/Urgent Contexts

❌ **Long rambling sentences**
- Emergency demands brevity
- Should drop to 9-12 words

❌ **Over-explanation**
- "Here's why we need shields" (no time for why)
- Just: "SHIELDS UP NOW!"

### In Storytelling Moments

❌ **Under 20 words/line**
- Storytelling needs expansion
- Should be 23+ words for narrative flow

❌ **Missing environmental detail**
- "So there I was..." needs conditions (cold, dark, obstacles)

| Too formal | Add contractions: "I am" → "I'm," maximise casualness |
| No "Bah" | Add dismissive opener: "Bah. [Statement]" |
| Missing experience | Add citation: "Trust someone who's seen..."  |
| Under-explained | Expand teaching: Add "when...and..." clauses for context |
| No stone metaphor | Add: "bedrock," "foundation," "avalanche," or "rocks don't lie" |
| Abstract language | Replace flowery words with practical engineer terms |
| Teaching frame missing | Use: "[X] is a young soldier's mistake" structure |
