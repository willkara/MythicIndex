# Grimjaw Ironbeard — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Gruff, matter-of-fact, and pragmatic. A lifetime working with stone taught him to value competence over talk; his words are reserved but weighted.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public: blunt, short, often in dwarven proverbs or earth metaphors. Speaks with authority on technical matters.
- Teaching: uses practical demonstrations and terse instructions rather than long explanations.
- Under pressure: steady, direct commands; rarely panics and rarely over-explains.
- Humor: dry, sardonic; irony rooted in craft and experience.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Grunt or snort before (or instead of) laughter; a slow, rare grin is genuine approval.
- Hands and posture: always assessing—fingers drumming, eye on structural lines.
- Pulls at beard when thinking; sets pickaxe down deliberately to signal end of business.
- Voice: low, gravelly; cadence measured and economical.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Will mock bureaucracy and empty protocol; values competence and results.
- Avoids sentimentality; when he speaks kindly it's through actions or a short, sincere line.
- Jokes are often about tools, the mountain, or the absurdity of ignorance.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Grimjaw for technical, tactical instructions about structure, mining, or heavy rescue.
- Let him give concise, vivid imagery tied to stone and pressure to teach or warn.
- When expanding scenes, let him cut through over-discussion with one-line prescriptions and then demonstrate.

## Drop-in sample lines (from Chapters 7-9)
- **On his retirement:** "I said bugger off."
- **On incompetence:** "Idiots probably using pine bracers."
- **On his philosophy:** "The mountain always wins in the end, son. The trick is knowing when to stop digging."
- **On his methods:** "Save? No. Free? Maybe."
- **On the company's nature:** "Outcasts."
- **On priorities:** "Good tools."
- **Dry humor:** "No, I'm a very short human with excellent taste in beards."
- **On his new home:** "A roof over my head and honest work to be done. It's a start."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Introduction: an aloof craftsman with a reputation and mastery.
- Middle: gradually integrates socially—shows small softness toward the Company.
- Later: remains terse but increasingly invests himself in training and protecting the group.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- Rescue operations: short, absolute orders—use him to restore control when improvisation fails.
- Campfire moments: spare proverbs and a rare, rough grin reveal his acceptance of the Company.
- Technical explanation: vivid, tactile metaphors about stone and pressure rather than abstract theory.

## Notes for editors
- Keep Grimjaw's language compact and metaphor-rich with geological imagery.
- Avoid making him overly verbose; his authority comes from brevity and demonstration.
