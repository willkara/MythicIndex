## Psychological Profile
*   **Grimjaw Ironbeard (The Patriarch):** Having already lived a full and successful life, Grimjaw is motivated by a desire for continued purpose and a deep-seated need to nurture and protect. He has nothing left to prove, which makes him the perfect mentor. His gruffness is a shield for a deeply warm and paternal heart. He sees the younger members as his "kids" and his clan, and his greatest fear is being seen as obsolete or unable to protect them.
