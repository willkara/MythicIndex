- **Cultural Background**: Tiefling, with a natural affinity for fire magic.

## Personal Details
- **A Passionate Artist**: Ignis was a gifted glassblower. He was utterly fascinated by the interplay of heat, sand, and breath, and he saw it as a more controlled, delicate form of his own fire magic. He would spend his downtime in any city with a good workshop, creating beautiful, swirling glass sculptures. He once made a set of five small, colored glass animals, one for each member of the Gilded Compass. Veyra's—a small, green bird—was shattered in the ambush, and she still carries the largest remaining shard.
- **How He Relaxed**: He loved to sit by a large campfire and engage in "flame-scrying," telling elaborate, fantastical stories based on the shapes he saw dancing in the flames. His tales were always heroic and wildly exaggerated, casting his companions as legendary figures. It was his way of showing his deep affection and admiration for them.
- **Favorite Meal**: Blackened, spicy fish tacos with a sweet fruit salsa. It was a meal of dramatic contrasts—hot and sweet, savory and fresh. He loved the theatricality of cooking the fish over an open flame until it was perfectly charred, and the messy, vibrant experience of eating it with his friends.
- **Favorite Drink**: Emberwine mulled with cinnamon bark and slivers of candied ginger. He liked to ignite the surface with a fingertip spark, laughing as the flames danced before he blew them out and took a sip.
