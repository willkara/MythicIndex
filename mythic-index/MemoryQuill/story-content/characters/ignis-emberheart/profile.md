## Significance
Ignis Emberheart was the Gilded Compass's fire sorcerer whose wild magic surge catastrophically amplified the cult's ritual. His desperate attempt to counter the cult's magic instead fed their spell, creating the disaster. His ambiguous fate—trapped alive behind molten glass—haunts Veyra and represents the ultimate failure of "no one left behind."

## The Catastrophe
His wild magic surge harmonized with the cult's ritual instead of disrupting it, causing a massive detonation that sealed the party's fate. Standing at ground-zero with "flames wreathing him like a crown of regret," he desperately tried to undo what he had caused.

## Final Moments
Last seen alive but trapped as the canyon collapsed, his desperate plea "Scout, find another path—live—" was among the last words Veyra heard. The "I" stone represents not just his memory but the uncertainty of his fate.

## Unresolved Mystery
- Was he transformed by the magic?
- Did he survive in some altered state?

- Connection to the Shadow Watcher in Veyra's dreams?

## Legacy
- Name inscribed in Hall of Remembrance (despite uncertain fate)
- The "I" stone carried as a token
- His fate drives Veyra's "never left" vow
- Represents the Company's mission to find even the impossible to reach
