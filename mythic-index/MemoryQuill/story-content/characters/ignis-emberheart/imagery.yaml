slug: "ignis-emberheart"
appearance: "Ignis Emberheart is a striking, fire-touched humanoid whose appearance immediately betrays his arcane heritage. His skin possesses a textured, ruddy orange hue, akin to heated clay, and his pointed ears frame a face defined by an intense, almost manic grin. His most arresting feature is his hair, which is not organic matter but a perpetual, upward-flickering corona of bright orange and yellow flames. His eyes are equally brilliant, glowing as solid orbs of molten gold without visible pupils or sclera. A long, dark tail curls distinctively over his right shoulder, blending into the shadows of his attire. He wears a dark, heavy, textured jacket, perhaps of thick leather, with a high collar and a diagonal strap secured by a metal buckle across his chest. In his left hand, he manifests a swirling, volatile plume of magical fire, highlighting his dangerous power."
