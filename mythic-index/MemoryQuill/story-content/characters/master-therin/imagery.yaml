appearance: "Master Therin Goldweave is a robust, elderly human male whose face bears the deep lines and weathered texture of a long life spent near the forge. He is balding, with coarse grey-white hair remaining on the sides of his head, matched by a full, thick beard and mustache. His dark, hooded eyes are fixed with a critical, focused gaze upon a small metal component he examines in his gnarled right hand. He is clad in a heavy, dark brown leather smith’s apron, worn and stained with use, worn over a thick, dark long-sleeved shirt. His powerful, calloused hands rest amidst a scattered array of iron hardware hinges and brackets on a wooden workbench. The warm, orange glow of a forge fire illuminates his side, highlighting the intense concentration of a seasoned artisan master deeply engaged in his craft."
