appearance: "Quierk is a mature aarakocra whose avian frame carries the quiet confidence of long experience. His plumage is a functional blend of earth tones suited to the Thornwood edge, featuring mottled browns, muted tans, and deep forest greens that allow him to blend into his surroundings. His most striking feature is his pair of keen, intelligent eyes, which possess a piercing quality that seems to assess newcomers with a single, all-encompassing glance. Despite his aerial nature, his attire is grounded and practical, consisting of simple innkeeper clothes such as a sturdy tunic or apron modified with reinforced slits to accommodate his large wingspan. He moves with an economical stillness, rarely wasting energy on unnecessary gestures, projecting an aura of competence and watchful silence."
