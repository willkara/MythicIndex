appearance: "Marcus Heartbridge is a mature human male with a poised, confident bearing, captured seated in a dimly lit study. He has dark brown, wavy hair that recedes slightly at the temples, accompanied by a neatly trimmed mustache and a small goatee that frames his mouth. His dark brown eyes hold a calm, sophisticated gaze as he rests one hand on the hilt of an ornate rapier at his hip and holds a glass of amber liquor in the other. He is dressed in heavy, well-tailored dark garments, featuring a thick wool coat worn over a closely buttoned doublet, with a crisp white shirt collar visible underneath. A prominent ring set with a dark stone adorns the pinky finger of his right hand, catching the low light. His overall presence projects an air of intelligent, cultivated authority and comfortable wealth."
