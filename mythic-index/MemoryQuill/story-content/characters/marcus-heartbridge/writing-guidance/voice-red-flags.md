# Marcus Heartbridge - Voice Red Flags

**Purpose:** Common voice violations and antipatterns to avoid.

---

## Critical Red Flags

### ❌ Casual or Informal Speech

**Problem:** Marcus is formal (6% contractions, lowest of all characters). Casual language completely breaks voice.

**Example Violation:** "Hey, yeah, we gotta speed this up, man. Let's just get it done quick."

**Correct:** "I would respectfully suggest that we expedite certain procedures to address the situation appropriately."

---

### ❌ Under-Explaining

**Problem:** Marcus over-explains bureaucratically. Under-explanation suggests wrong character.

**Violation:** Single-sentence responses when Marcus would elaborate.

**Correction:** Add procedural detail, hedging, justification.

---

### ❌ Missing Hedging Language

**Problem:** Hedging ("may," "might," "certain," "particular") is fundamental to Marcus's anxiety.

**Violation:** Statements without hedges in Marcus dialogue.

**Correction:** Insert: "may have," "certain," "particular," "if I may," etc.

---

### ❌ Taking Blame Too Quickly

**Problem:** Marcus DOES apologize, but often defensively explains first. Immediate blame-taking without explanation can seem wrong.

**Violation:** "I'm sorry" with zero context or explanation.

**Correction:** "I apologize for [situation]. The regulation requires that [explanation]. I regret any [consequence]."

## Moderate Red Flags

### ⚠️ Contractions Over 15%

**Problem:** Marcus is 6% contractions (very formal). Over 15% suggests wrong voice.

**Violation:** Multiple contractions in Marcus dialogue ("I'm," "don't," "can't").

**Correction:** Minimize: "I am" not "I'm," "do not" not "don't."

---

### ⚠️ Fragments (Under 5% is target)

**Problem:** Marcus uses complete sentences almost exclusively (96%). Fragments break formality.

**Violation:** "Dispatch ready. Approved." style fragmentation.

**Correction:** "The dispatch is ready and approved."

---

### ⚠️ Words/Line Under 12

**Problem:** Marcus is 17.3 words/line (longest). Under 12 words suggests wrong character.

**Violation:** Short, clipped sentences from Marcus.

**Correction:** Expand with bureaucratic detail and hedging.

---

### ⚠️ Missing Apology Markers in Crisis Contexts

**Problem:** When questioned/blamed, Marcus should apologize.

**Violation:** Crisis dialogue where Marcus doesn't apologize or explain.

**Correction:** Start with "I apologize..." or "Unfortunately..." or "Regrettably..."
