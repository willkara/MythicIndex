# Marcus Heartbridge - Canon State Reference

**Timeline Reference:** Canyon Incident = Day 0

---

## Knowledge States

**Early (Week 1-2):** Professional administrative role
**Mid (Month 1-3):** Increasing tension with Veyra, knowledge withholding
**Late (Month 4+):** POST-BETRAYAL state (CRITICAL continuity flag from phase4)

**Betrayal Arc:** Ignis's fate connected to Marcus storyline (flagged MAJOR continuity issue)
- [ ] Never regress to Week 1-2 trust level without reconciliation event
- [ ] Betray timing must match phase4 canon mapping

---

## Injuries

**From Canyon:** [Per phase4 tracking]
- **Recovery:** By Month 4, healed

## Relationship Evolution

### Marcus ↔ Veyra

**Week 1-2:** Professional working relationship
**Month 1-3:** Tension escalating, trust eroding
**Month 4+:** POST-BETRAYAL state, significant strain
**CRITICAL:** Relationship arc is non-negotiable per phase4 mapping

### Marcus ↔ Company

**Week 1-2:** Administrator, accepted member
**Month 1-3:** Growing distance, mistrust building
**Month 4+:** Post-betrayal isolation or partial reconciliation

---

## Emotional State

**Week 1-2:** Anxious but functional
**Month 1-3:** Increasingly defensive, guilt-driven hedging
**Month 4+:** Post-betrayal consequences manifesting

---

## Continuity CRITICAL FLAGS

🚩 **No sudden warmth toward Veyra in Month 4+** without explicit reconciliation event
🚩 **Marcus maintains apologetic hedging throughout** (never becomes confident)
🚩 **Ignis's fate must align with phase4 mapping** (not independent storyline)
🚩 **Betrayal must occur within established timeline window**

---

## Writing Constraint

**No rewinding relationship progression:**
- [ ] Week 1 formality must regress to Month 1-3 tension
- [ ] Month 4+ coldness is established baseline
- [ ] Any reconciliation is major narrative event (not casual)
