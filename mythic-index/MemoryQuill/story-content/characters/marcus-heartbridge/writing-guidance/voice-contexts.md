- **Tone:** Anxious, defensive, overly explanatory

### Characteristics

- **Apology lead** - statements begin with "I apologize for..."
- **Over-explanation** - too much detail to cover all bases

- **Contractions:** 8% (still formal but less rigid)
- **Hedging:** Drops to 15% (unusual for Marcus)
- **Tone:** Resolute but still careful

### Characteristics

- **Statement instead of hedging** - "This must be done" (vs "I believe this should perhaps be considered...")
- **Decisions instead of questions** - prescriptive rather than suggestive
- **Still formal** - doesn't become casual
- **Rare but decisive** - contradiction to character makes it memorable

### Example

**Example 1:** "Commander, with respect, this decision is not negotiable. We proceed as planned."
- 12 words, direct statement
- Unusual confidence for Marcus
- Still formal but clear
