## Personal Details

- **Habits**: Maintaining meticulous records in his enchanted journal
- **Hobbies**: TBD
- **Personal Quarters**: A luxurious, two-room suite in a quiet wing of the Establishment building, soundproofed with heavy tapestries. The antechamber is a comfortable salon with several plush armchairs, a low table, and a well-stocked bar cart featuring rare wines and spirits. The inner room contains a large, canopied bed and a handsome mahogany writing desk. The walls are hung with rich, sound-dampening tapestries depicting historical negotiations and trade agreements. This suite is a tool of his trade. The salon is his "soft" office, where he builds rapport with contacts over a glass of fine brandy, extracting information through casual conversation. The inner room is his private sanctum. The desk is for his official correspondence, but a cleverly hidden panel in the desk reveals a smaller, more discreet set of tools: invisible inks, coded ledgers, and a collection of wax seals from various noble houses and guilds. He uses this space to be the man the Company needs him to be, balancing the public face with the private machinations.

- **Hidden Arsenal**: Sleeve-mounted hand crossbow, cufflink lockpicks, signet ring with hidden compartment, belt buckle listening device
- **Armor**: Formal attire with subtle reinforcements woven into rich fabrics - protection that looks like fashion
- **Fighting Style**: Misdirection duelist - uses flourishes, conversation, and psychology to confuse opponents while striking. He is not a frontline combatant and avoids direct battle where possible, preferring to act as an observer or support role from a safe distance.
- **Signature Move**: "Diplomatic Immunity" - talks his way out of combat entirely, making opponents question why they wanted to fight
- **Combat Philosophy**: "A fight avoided is a victory achieved, but if combat is unavoidable, make it brief and profitable"
- **Tactical Role**: Social infiltrator and negotiator who opens doors with words that others would need crowbars for

## Psychological Response Matrix
- **In Crisis**: Immediately identifies all stakeholders, their motivations, and potential leverage points - treats every crisis like a negotiation
- **During Negotiation**: Already knows what everyone wants before they speak, three moves ahead in the conversation
- **During Interrogation**: Transforms into a cold predator who finds psychological weak points and applies precise pressure until resistance collapses
- **Moral Dilemma**: Reframes ethical problems as negotiation puzzles with win-win solutions, comfortable with morally gray methods when necessary
- **Team Conflict**: Mediates by making each side believe they've won while serving the mission
- **Under Personal Attack**: Deflects with charm and humor while mentally filing information for future leverage
- **In Victory**: Networks with defeated opponents, turning enemies into future assets
- **Persona Shifting**: Can seamlessly transition between charming diplomat and psychological manipulator, with teammates unsure which is his "true" face

## Voice & Dialogue Patterns
- **Speech Style**: Adjusts vocabulary, accent, and mannerisms to perfectly match his audience - chameleon-like adaptation
- **Signature Phrases**: 
  - "Let's find our mutual advantage"
  - "Hypothetically speaking..." (maintains plausible deniability)
  - "I'm sure we can reach an understanding"
  - "It's always a pleasure to have a good, honest chat" (with predatory undertones during interrogations)
  - "He believed I would. That's the only part of it that has to be true." (on psychological manipulation)
- **Diplomatic Edge**: Speaks in hypotheticals, implies without stating, makes everything sound reasonable
- **Interrogation Voice**: Shifts to soft, conversational murmurs with intimate, threatening undertones - "whisper the right words into the cracks until the whole thing collapses"
- **Example Dialogue**: "Hypothetically, if one were to need passage through the Duke's checkpoint, one might mention the Duchess's birthday gala... purely as conversation, of course."
- **Perfect Partnership**: Completes Kaida's sentences, communicates through meaningful glances - "The Lock and The Key"
- **Emotional Tells**: Smile becomes more genuine when truly pleased, fingers drum when calculating, adjusts cuffs when transitioning between personas

## Notes

- Approaches rescues like complex trade negotiations, analyzing all parties involved and finding leverage points
- Creates tension with Thorne due to their different approaches (by-the-book military vs. "whatever works")
- Partners effectively with Kaida on intelligence-gathering missions
- Sees bribes and unorthodox methods as practical tools to prevent bloodshed
- Maintains his regular diplomatic duties alongside his work with the Company
- Views hostage negotiations and trade agreements as fundamentally similar, just with different stakes
- First encountered the Company at the Wayward Compass while on an independent operation
- **Interrogation Philosophy**: "Physical torture is crude, unreliable, and quite illegal. But the mind... the mind can be its own torturer with the right encouragement. All perfectly legal, I assure you."
- **Psychological Techniques**: Uses detailed pre-operational intelligence gathering, family leverage, financial pressure, and intimate psychological dominance to break resistance without violence
- **Persona Complexity**: Seamlessly transitions between charming diplomat and cold predator - teammates may never know which is his "true" face or if he even has one
- **Professional Authorization**: Lady Blackwater grants him "considerable flexibility" in interpreting prisoner treatment codes, suggesting his reputation for results is well-known in intelligence circles
