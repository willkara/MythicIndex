## Psychological Profile
*   **Marcus Heartbridge (The Fixer):** Marcus is a pragmatist who views the world as a complex web of leverage points and relationships. He is not immoral, but he is amoral in his methods; the ends (a successful rescue, a peaceful resolution) absolutely justify the means (bribery, manipulation, blackmail). He is a master of masks, equally comfortable in a noble's court and a criminal's den. His core belief is that the most elegant solution is the one that avoids bloodshed, and he sees his work as a form of high-stakes art.
