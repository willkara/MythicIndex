# Marcus "The Voice" Heartbridge — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Smooth, persuasive, and urbane. A trained diplomat and broker who moves social levers with charm and a calculating calm.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public: eloquent, richly phrased when it suits advantage; uses rhetorical questions and polished cadence.
- Negotiation: adaptive—mirrors the other party's tone, then steers toward a soft, inevitable agreement.
- Under pressure: remains composed, layers distraction or humor to buy time while he recalibrates.
- Humor: worldly, slightly theatrical; uses wit to disarm or reframe tense moments.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Hands: small, graceful gestures—palms open when sincere, fingers steepled when calculating.
- Smile: practiced and warm, can mask negotiation posture; a genuine smile is rare and thus meaningful.
- Voice: smooth, variable tempo; he slows to emphasize bargains and speeds up to lighten a mood.
- Eye contact lingers when testing sincerity.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Avoids crude or cruel jokes; prefers irony or urbane barbs.
- Will never publicly admit panic or genuine uncertainty—deflects with plans or flattery.
- Keeps secrets close; jokes may be a cover for truth-testing.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Marcus to broker deals, supply political cover, or introduce plausible diversionary plans.
- Let him speak longer than others—his sentences can be a rhythm others respond to.
- When adding dialogue, give him the role of smoothing conflict: pose a rhetorical question, then offer a small concession that secures leverage.

## Drop-in sample lines
- Negotiation opener: "Gentlemen, consider not the wound but the healing—what will it cost you to be remembered kindly?"
- Reassurance/plan: "Leave the politics to me; you do what you do best and I'll make sure the doors stay open."
- Dry aside: "A little discretion and a well-placed smile solve more problems than a locked gate."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Introduced as the polished broker; increasingly reveals a practical, loyal side to the Company—still urbane, but with clearer personal stakes.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- In meetings: longer, persuasive speeches that reframe risk as opportunity.
- Before a mission: private pep-talks that combine practical logistics with morale-boosting polish.
- In public-facing interactions: the face that turns hostility into manageable friction.

## Notes for editors
- Keep Marcus artful but never obfuscatory—his words should clarify incentives.
- Avoid making him a caricature of charm; anchor his speech with concrete offers and small reveals of genuine concern.
