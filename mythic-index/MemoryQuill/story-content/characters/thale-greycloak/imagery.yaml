appearance: "Captain Thale Greycloak is a powerfully built human male appearing to be in his late forties or fifties, possessing a rugged, heavily weathered complexion and a severe, scowling facial expression. His short, dark brown hair is kept in a practical, receding military cut, complemented by a full, thick beard and mustache of the same dark shade. Intense, shadowed dark eyes gaze out steadily from beneath a deeply furrowed brow, observing his surroundings with predatory focus. He is enveloped in a voluminous, heavy dark brown wool cloak that drapes over a buttoned, olive-drab military-style tunic outfitted with tarnished brass fasteners. A thick leather utility belt with a rectangular metal buckle clinches his waist beneath a diagonal leather strap, and a distinctive six-pointed bronze star badge is pinned prominently to his left breast. His overall presence is one of imposing, disciplined menace, radiating the air of an experienced and ruthless commander amidst the warm glow of the room."
