## Notes

**Role at Veridian**: Captain Greycloak serves as Head of Security for Veridian Agronomics, responsible for protecting both the legitimate research operations and the hidden trafficking facility. He manages security personnel including Sergeant Dalton Crowsight and oversees threat assessment of visitors and staff.

**Tactical Competence**: During the gala, he immediately identified multiple threat indicators: Cid's magical spark from her prosthetic hand, Dr. Mourngrave's "glacial stillness" signaling alarm, and the overall pattern of the Last Light Company's reconnaissance activities. He moves with "quiet purpose" like "a wolf cutting a sheep from the flock."

**Attempted Isolation**: When he identified the Company as a threat, he immediately moved to isolate one of the investors (Lord Thann) for a "private consultation regarding investment security" - likely intending to remove a potential witness or information source. This tactical move was countered by Marcus Heartbridge's social maneuvering.

**Professional Frustration**: His confrontation with Marcus demonstrated his professionalism - when outmaneuvered socially, he chose to withdraw rather than cause a scene that would reveal his true purpose. However, his locked gaze with Marcus showed he understood he'd been beaten and marked Marcus as a dangerous opponent.

**Relationship with Dalton Crowsight**: Works alongside Sergeant Crowsight, with Greycloak handling physical security and tactical operations while Crowsight focuses on counter-intelligence and interrogation. Together they form Veridian's security apparatus.

**Military Background**: His title of "Captain" and professional military bearing suggest formal military training, possibly with Waterdeep's City Watch or military forces. He brings that discipline and tactical thinking to his criminal security operations.
