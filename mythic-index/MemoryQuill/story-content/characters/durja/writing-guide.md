# Durja - Comedy Writing Guide

## Comedy Archetype: The No-Nonsense Proprietor

### Core Comedy Style
**Monosyllabic management / Grunt-based communication / Economic words**

Durja is funny because she runs The Wayward Compass with maximum efficiency and minimum words. Grunts constitute 40% of her dialogue. She values two things: payment and peace. Violate either, face consequences.

### What Makes Her Funny

- **Communicates in grunts** - Full conversations without words
- **Payment obsession** - Coin first, questions never
- **Economical speech** - Why use many words when few do?
- **Intimidating efficiency** - Solves problems FAST
- **Sees everything** - Notices all, says nothing (unless you owe money)
- **Unexpected softness** - Rare moments of actual care (immediately denied)

### Example Comedy Moments

Patron: "Excuse me, could I perhaps inquire about the availability of—"
Durja: "Two silver."
Patron: "I haven't said what I—"

Patron: "Actually I was wondering—"
Durja: [grunt]
Patron: "...I'll take both." [hands over coins]
Durja: [grunt of approval] "Upstairs. Left."
```

- She remembers everything
- Tabs are SACRED
- Regulars get minimal preference (still pay)

**With Troublemakers:** Swift justice

- Ban list is long and permanent
- She's surprisingly strong
- Nobody argues twice

**With The Company:** Grudging tolerance
- They pay on time (acceptable)
- They bring interesting news (valuable)
- She might like them (would never admit)
- Grunts are slightly less harsh

### Signature Communication

- Affirmative grunt: "Hnn."
- Negative grunt: "Nnh."
- Questioning grunt: "Hn?"

- Satisfied grunt: "Hnnnn."
- Payment grunt: [extends hand]

**Verbal Economy:**
- "Out."
- "Pay."

### Running Gags

- **The Grunt Language** - Team learns to interpret
- **Payment First** - Even for questions
- **The Stare** - Solves most problems
- **Unexpected Strength** - Throws out large men easily
- **Secret Softness** - Denied immediately when noticed
- **"No Tab"** - Absolute rule (except...)

### Quick Reference

**Funny when:** Grunt conversations, immediate problem-solving, payment obsession, economic speech
**NOT funny when:** Rare moments of actual care, protecting vulnerable patrons, her backstory

### The Golden Rule

Durja is funniest when she solves complex social situations with maximum efficiency and minimum words. Grunts are a complete language. Payment is sacred. Peace is mandatory. She's intimidating but surprisingly fair.

### Special Notes

**The Grunt System:**
- Team gradually learns it
- Finn eventually becomes fluent
- She approves (won't say so)
- Grunts are faster than Common
- More efficient = better

**Payment Philosophy:**
- Coin first, always
- Fair prices, no negotiation
- Tabs are temporary loans (suspicious)
- She remembers every debt
- Collection is inevitable

**Secret Soft Side:**
- Extra stew for struggling families (added to others' tabs)
- Protects vulnerable patrons silently
- Remembers people's preferences (won't mention)
- If caught being nice: immediate denial via grunt
