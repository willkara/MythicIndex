slug: "durja"
appearance: "Durja is a formidable, mature female orc with a powerfully built frame and thick, muscular arms evident beneath her sleeves. Her textured skin is a deep mossy green, set in a stern, almost challenging expression with prominent lower tusks protruding from her jaw. Dark, shadowed eyes gaze intensely from beneath a heavy brow ridge marked with faint scarring, and her dark hair is pulled tightly back from her face. She is dressed in practical, rustic attire suitable for her trade, wearing a heavy, reddish-brown leather apron cinched at the waist by a wide leather belt with a simple metal buckle over a rough, short-sleeved grey-brown shirt. Standing with her arms crossed defiantly in the warm, dim light of the inn, she projects an unmistakable air of gruff authority and capable strength."
