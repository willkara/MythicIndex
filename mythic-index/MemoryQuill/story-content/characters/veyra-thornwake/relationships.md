## Professional Relationships
- **Captain Thorne Brightward**: 
  - *Nature of Relationship*: Comrades-in-arms; the "band of brothers" epitomized.
  - *Hierarchy*: Veyra is his Commander, and he is her unwavering Deputy. The trust is absolute.
  - *Dynamics*: Their bond is the foundational pillar of the Company, forged in tragedy and cemented by unspoken, mutual respect. They are two sides of the same coin. Veyra is the hardened idealist, fully aware she can't save everyone but honor-bound to try. Thorne is the pragmatist who makes her attempts possible. Their disagreements are purely tactical and always respectful, the debates of two commanders seeking the best path to an agreed-upon goal. Their bond is further deepened by shared strategic planning and mutual support in the face of new threats like the Silent Hand.
  - *History*: Thorne, then a city guard, was part of the patrol that discovered the aftermath of the Undershade canyon ambush. He found Veyra, the sole survivor, refusing to leave her fallen comrades. He stood vigil with her for two days as she buried them, and in that shared silence, he swore to follow her and help build her vision.
  - *Current Status*: Unshakably loyal. He is her most trusted confidant and tactical sounding board, especially in strategic matters.

  - *Nature of Relationship*: Commander and Medic; Confidant
  - *Hierarchy*: Commander to specialist, but with a deep, almost spiritual, equality.
  - *Dynamics*: Aldwin is the only one who truly understands the immense weight Veyra carries. He acts as her unofficial confessor and quiet counsel. His tea ceremonies are a private ritual for them, a way for him to "heal the healer" and provide her with moments of peace she would never ask for herself. Their bond is one of shared witness to suffering and a mutual, unspoken understanding of the cost of their work.
  - *History*: Witnessed Veyra's dedication during a plague outbreak, which inspired him to join.

  - *Dynamics*: Veyra trusts Marcus's loyalty to the Company's mission, second only to Thorne's. She understands the necessity of his diplomatic maneuvering but is often impatient with its inherent subtlety and moral compromises. She wishes he could be more direct, but respects that his methods are effective in a world she has little taste for.
