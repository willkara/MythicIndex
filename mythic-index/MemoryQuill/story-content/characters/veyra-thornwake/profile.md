## Personal Details
- **Habits**: Collecting tokens from those she's saved or buried
- **Hobbies**: Maintaining her "record of weight" tattoo
- **Personal Quarters**: A circular room with a high, vaulted ceiling at the base of the Keep. The walls are bare, honey-colored stone, cool to the touch. The only furniture is a narrow cot with a single grey wool blanket, a heavy wooden chest, and a tall, imposing armor stand. There are no windows, only the steady, unwavering light of a single magical lantern that casts long shadows. This room is less a bedroom and more a monk's cell dedicated to a single purpose. It is silent, save for the faint, distant hum of the Bastion. The dominant feature is a massive wall covered in maps, not just of the Sword Coast, but of specific, dangerous regions: the Spine of the World, the Underdark, the Shadowfell. Red threads connect active missions, while black threads trace the paths of failures. She uses this space not just for rest, but for a nightly vigil, mentally walking the paths of her people, anticipating dangers, and mourning the lost. The small, worn wooden box on the chest contains dozens of tokens—a splinter of a shield, a single steel feather, a dried flower—each a tangible memory of a life she touched.

- **Secondary Weapon**: Composite longbow with salvaged strings from fallen comrades' instruments
- **Armor**: Weatherworn leather coat reinforced with old, mismatched armor plates—each a remnant of someone else's gear
- **Special Items**: Battered metal lantern that glows with soft gold light, said to reveal itself only to the lost

### Fighting Style Evolution
- **Past Style (Pre-Incident)**: Whirlwind fighter - constant movement, aggressive dual-blade dancing, relying on speed and momentum
- **Current Style (Post-Trauma)**: Tactical defender - precise, calculated strikes from defensive positions. Each movement deliberate and meaningful, no wasted motion.
- **Philosophy Shift**: From "strike fast, strike often" to "every cut must count"
- **Signature Move**: "Guardian's Stand" - defensive position that protects rescue targets while delivering precise counterstrikes
- **Combat Role**: Battlefield controller who positions herself for maximum situational awareness, prioritizing protection over aggression

## Psychological Response Matrix
- **In Crisis**: Becomes hypervigilant, compartmentalizes emotion, speaks in clipped commands. Counts everything—people, exits, threats, time.
- **During Negotiation**: Lets others talk while she reads body language for threats. Rarely speaks but when she does, it's definitive.
- **Moral Dilemma**: Weighs lives mathematically - will sacrifice principle for people. "The math is simple—more alive is better."
- **Team Conflict**: Mediates through action rather than words. "We move forward" ends most arguments.
- **Under Personal Attack**: Deflects to mission focus - personal pain is irrelevant to the objective.
- **In Victory**: Immediately shifts to casualty assessment. No celebration until all are safe and accounted for.

## Voice & Dialogue Patterns
- **Speech Style**: Short, declarative sentences. Rarely uses "I think" or "maybe" - speaks in certainties
- **Signature Phrases**: 
  - "Clock's running" (her urgency phrase)
  - "Hope is a tool. Use it."
  - Never says "leave them" - will find alternatives
- **Vocabulary**: Military efficiency mixed with medical precision. Counts constantly in speech.
- **Example Dialogue**: "Three exits. Two guards. Sixty seconds. Vera, take high. Thorne, with me."
- **Emotional Tells**: Voice gets quieter when more dangerous, never louder
- **Combat Commands**: Brief and clear - "Mercy for the fallen, Judgment for the standing"

## Notes
- A trail of ink winds up her left side, starting at her hand and vanishing beneath her armor—names written in old dialects of fallen friends, rescuees, even enemies. She calls it her "record of weight."
- Philosophy: "Hope is a tool. Use it."
- Speaks in low, deliberate tones and leads with calm gravity even in chaos
- Demonstrated her pragmatic leadership during the Stonebridge investigation by navigating the team's moral conflict, allowing them to bend the law but not break their principles. She is adept at adapting plans when new intelligence comes to light (Chapter 13).

### Public Perception
- Widely known for her "record of weight" tattoo, a rumor that is true and reinforces her personal commitment to every life.
- Rumored to have survived a dragon's fire, which explains the prominent burn scar on her face and adds to her legendary toughness.
- Respected in political circles for her direct, no-nonsense approach, which is seen as both refreshing and unnerving.
