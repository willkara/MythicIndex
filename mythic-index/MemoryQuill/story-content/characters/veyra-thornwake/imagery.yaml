appearance: "Veyra Thornwake is a battle-hardened half-elf with a stoic presence and a wiry, strong build. Her warm brown skin is dominated by a significant, textured burn scar covering the left side of her face from jaw to temple, contrasting with her intense, unwavering dark eyes. She wears her dark brown hair in a striking practical style featuring a spiky mohawk with shaved sides, and longer braids adorned with feathers falling past her shoulder. Distinctive blue swirling tattoos curl across her neck and down her left arm. Her attire is practical and worn, consisting of layered dark leather armor, a heavy cowl wrapped around her neck, reinforced shoulder pauldrons, and sturdy bracers. Hanging from her utility belt is a battered metal lantern, glowing with a warm, steady orange light against the dark leather of her gear."
