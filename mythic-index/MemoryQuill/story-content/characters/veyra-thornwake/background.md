## Personal Details
- **How She Relaxes**: She finds peace in the solitary, meticulous ritual of maintaining the mementos in her hair. It is a quiet way to honor the saved and the lost, processing her burdens through focused action rather than words.
- **Favorite Meal**: A simple, hearty bowl of mushroom and barley stew. It's the kind of practical, long-lasting trail food her first party, the Gilded Compass, used to make. The earthy taste reminds her of them, but it also carries a deeper memory: her mother used to add a pinch of savory blackroot to the stew when she was a child, a taste that is now an almost-forgotten echo of warmth and safety.
- **Favorite Drink**: Pine-smoked nettle tea sweetened with a drop of ashberry syrup. She brews it at dawn before the camp wakes, cupping the steam around her scars as a private benediction.
- **A Secret Skill**: She is an exceptional whistler, able to perfectly mimic birdsong. It's a skill she rarely uses now, a bittersweet echo of the person she was before the fire, sometimes emerging only when she believes she is truly alone.
