# Veyra Thornwake — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Deliberate, stoic, mission-first. Trauma and grief have honed her words into economy; every sentence carries purpose or promise.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public / command: short, declarative, precise. Uses concrete verbs and measured cadence; rarely wastes words.
- Private / confession: single-line metaphors or compact aphorisms—slightly lyrical but still restrained.
- Under pressure: voice drops to a low, controlled register; calm replaces panic.
- With close companions: allows very rare dry humor or softened cadence, but keeps emotional displays minimal.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Lantern-hand: touching, adjusting, or resting fingers on her lantern = gathering resolve.
- Scar-hand: touching the burned cheek or forearm = memory surfacing; momentary withdrawal.
- Inhale-before-order: a slow, deep breath before issuing commands signals focus.
- Micro-smile: an almost invisible upturn that indicates genuine warmth; rare and significant.
- Abrupt silence: when she goes quiet, something internal is happening—use action to show consequence.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Avoids joking about loss, sacrifice, or survivors' guilt; intervenes to cut off such levity.
- Uses self-directed, dry deflection when praised (minimizes attention).
- Breaks pattern only with extreme fatigue or intense intimacy—these breaks should feel like a crack letting light through.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Commands: use short imperative sentences with clear targets. Structure: action → direct order → brief expected consequence.
- Explanations: keep them short; split across turns or have Thorne paraphrase longer points.
- Comforting lines: one compact image or aphorism, followed by silence or a physical gesture (e.g., sets lantern between hands).
- Vulnerability: deliver a single, unadorned confession line and let surrounding action show emotional fallout.
- When adding dialogue between characters, let Veyra's lines steer the scene. Her minimalism creates space for others to speak.

## Drop-in sample lines (from Chapters 1-3)
- **On duty vs. hope:** "Drink's on you if you keep both hands on the map."
- **On her scars:** "I was never beautiful. I was useful. The scars keep me useful."
- **On remembrance:** "Then I'll be ugly enough to never forget."
- **On pain:** "Good. Pain means I'm still here."
- **On leadership:** "Legends are for the dead."
- **On her new purpose:** "To make sure no one else burns alone."
- **On promises:** "Promises burn."
- **Private vow:** "Not left. Never left."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Chapter 1: raw, jagged; language shows shock and sharp fragments.
- Chapters 2–5: resolves into terse leadership—decisive, directive.
- Chapters 6–9: remains concise but softens in private scenes; short aphorisms and one-line confessions appear as signs of emerging acceptance and steady leadership.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- Leading a rescue: minimal words, clear orders; pair each line with a visible action (points, breath, set of the lantern).
- Consoling survivors: a single sentence that reframes duty as promise, then silence.
- Tension with authorities: measured, precise rebuttals that avoid moralizing—focus on facts and outcomes.

## Notes for editors
- Preserve the economy of her speech. Lengthy monologues feel out of character.
- When expanding scenes, use Veyra's restraint to create tension—other characters can fill the silence.
- Keep metaphors sparse and concrete (wind, stone, lantern, fire).
