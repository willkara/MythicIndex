- Mottled burn scar from jawline to temple on left side
- Sharp, clear dark eyes with unwavering gaze
- Intricate swirling tattoos on neck and arms (names in old dialects)
- Several simple ring piercings in ears
- Weatherworn leather coat with mismatched armor plates (remnants from others)
- Battered metal lantern at hip (glows gold, reveals itself to the lost)
- Dual scimitars: "Mercy" (silver-edged) and "Judgment" (cold iron)
- Calm, deliberate movements even in chaos
- Voice gets quieter when more dangerous
