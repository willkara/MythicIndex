## Psychological Profile
*   **Veyra Thornwake (The Survivor):** Her psychology is defined by trauma and purpose. The "record of weight" tattoo is a literal manifestation of her survivor's guilt; she carries the names of the lost so she doesn't have to carry their ghosts. Her calm, grave demeanor is a carefully constructed shield against the chaos she's witnessed. She leads not through charisma, but through an unshakeable, almost grim, determination. Her greatest fear is not her own death, but failing those who depend on her, which would be a repeat of her past trauma.
