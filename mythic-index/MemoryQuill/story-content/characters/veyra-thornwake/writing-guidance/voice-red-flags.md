# Veyra Thornwake - Voice Red Flags

**Purpose:** Common voice violations and antipatterns to avoid.

These are patterns that break Veyra's established voice, signaling need for immediate revision.

---

## Critical Red Flags (Voice-Breaking)

### ❌ Long Explanations or Philosophical Speeches

**Problem:** Veyra doesn't explain, justify, or philosophize. She commands.

**Example Violation:**
> "I think we should move the patrol earlier because it would give us better coverage during the vulnerable dawn hours, and strategically speaking, that's when most attacks historically occur."

**Why Wrong:**
- 30 words (vs 7.2 target)
- Explaining reasoning unprompted
- "I think" hedging language
- "strategically speaking" unnecessary qualifier
- No economy whatsoever

**Correct Version:**
> "Move patrol earlier. Dawn's vulnerable."

**Revision:** 5 words, fragments, no explanation. If more context needed, Thorne asks; Veyra answers economically.

---

### ❌ Flowery or Decorative Metaphors

**Problem:** Veyra's metaphors are **functional** and **trauma-rooted only**. No poetic language.

**Example Violation:**
> "The sunset painted the sky with brushstrokes of amber and rose, a canvas of hope for tomorrow."

**Why Wrong:**
- Decorative description
- Art metaphors (painting, brushstrokes, canvas)
- Generic hope/beauty sentiment
- 14 words of pure atmosphere

**Correct Version:**
> "Sun's setting. Lost the light. Make camp."

**Exception:** Veyra ONLY uses light/fire imagery when **trauma-linked**:
- ✅ "We are the Last Light" (company identity)
- ✅ "Everything burned" (trauma reference)
- ✅ "The fire took them" (loss reference)

**Never:**
- Generic hope/light metaphors
- Decorative sunset descriptions
- Poetic atmospheric language

---

### ❌ Hedging Language (Unless Vulnerable Context)

**Problem:** Veyra is decisive. Hedging violates commander authority.

**Hedging Words to Avoid:**
- "perhaps" / "maybe" / "possibly"
- "I think" / "I believe" / "I feel like"
- "might" / "could" / "would" (in command context)
- "if you agree" / "if that's okay"
- "sort of" / "kind of"

**Example Violation:**
> "Perhaps we should consider fortifying the north wall? I think that might help, if you agree."

**Why Wrong:**
- Seeking approval (she gives orders)
- Three hedging words ("perhaps," "might," "if you agree")
- Question mark on command
- Uncertainty inappropriate for commander

**Correct Version:**
> "Fortify north wall. Make it happen."

**Exception:** Vulnerable/intimate context with Thorne allows conditional language about **emotions**, not tactics:
- ✅ "I can't lose anyone else" (emotional vulnerability)
- ❌ "Maybe we should retreat?" (tactical uncertainty)

---

### ❌ Over 15 Words Per Line (Calm/Command Context)

**Problem:** Verbosity violates Veyra's economy principle.

**Threshold Guide:**
- **Calm/Command:** 12 words max, target 6.1 avg
- **Combat/Stress:** 14 words max, target 8.3 avg
- **Vulnerable/Intimate:** 16 words max, target 11.4 avg

**Example Violation (Calm Context):**
> "I need you to take your squad and perform a reconnaissance sweep of the northern perimeter, then report back to me with a full assessment."

**Why Wrong:**
- 25 words in single sentence
- Calm command context (should be ~6 words)
- Over-explaining simple patrol order
- "I need you to" unnecessary framing

**Correct Version:**
> "North perimeter. Recon sweep. Full report."

**Revision:** 6 words, 3 fragments, perfect Veyra economy.

---

### ❌ Missing Signature Phrases in Major Scenes

**Problem:** Signature phrases make Veyra distinctive. Their absence in important scenes makes her generic.

**Minimum Deployment:** Major scenes featuring Veyra should include **at least 2 signature phrases**.

**Signature Phrase Checklist:**
- "Square?" - confirmation request
- "Clock's running" - time pressure
- "Job's done" / "It's done" - task completion
- "Move" / "Move out" - movement command
- "We are the Last Light" - rally/identity
- "Hold" / "Hold the line" - defensive command

**Example Violation:**
A 500-word combat scene where Veyra issues orders but never says "Hold," "Move," or "We are the Last Light."

**Why Wrong:**
- Loses voice distinctiveness
- Signature rally phrase ("We are the Last Light") especially critical in combat
- Generic commander voice instead of Veyra-specific

**Correction:** Insert minimum 2 signature phrases in scene beats.

## Moderate Red Flags (Revision Recommended)

### ⚠️ Complete Sentences in Calm Context

**Problem:** Fragments are Veyra's baseline (34% fragment usage). Too many complete sentences softens voice.

**Example:**
> "We need to move out now. The patrol is ready. Let's get going."

**Why Problematic:**
- Three complete sentences
- Could be more economical
- Lacks characteristic clipped rhythm

**Improved Version:**
> "Move out. Patrol's ready. Clock's running."

**Revision:** Fragments restore rhythm, signature phrase added.

---

### ⚠️ Unnecessary Qualifiers

**Problem:** Veyra doesn't hedge or soften with qualifiers unless vulnerable.

**Qualifiers to Cut:**
- "really" / "very" / "quite"
- "actually" / "basically" / "essentially"
- "just" / "simply"
- "a bit" / "a little"

**Example:**
> "I'm really concerned about the north wall. It's actually quite vulnerable."

**Improved Version:**
> "North wall's vulnerable."

**Revision:** Cut 11 words to 3, eliminated qualifiers.

---

### ⚠️ Chattiness or Small Talk

**Problem:** Veyra doesn't engage in small talk unless emotionally significant.

**Example Violation:**
> "How are you doing today? Sleep well? The weather's been nice lately, hasn't it?"

**Why Wrong:**
- Social pleasantries inappropriate
- Small talk about weather
- Chattiness violates economy
- Question tags ("hasn't it?") seeking engagement

**Exception:** With Thorne in private, brief personal check-ins acceptable:
- ✅ "You okay?" (concern for specific person)
- ❌ "How's everyone today?" (generic pleasantry)

---

### ⚠️ Emotional Labels

**Problem:** Veyra **shows** emotion through action/sensation, doesn't **tell** by labeling feelings.

**Don't Label:**
- "I'm angry" → Show: Hand to dagger, name as curse
- "I'm afraid" → Show: Pulse hammering, shadows as ambush
- "I'm sad" → Show: Staring at nothing, delayed blink

**Example Violation:**
> "I'm feeling really anxious about this mission and honestly quite worried about the team."

**Improved Version:**
> Her hand drifted to her dagger. "Clock's running."

**Revision:** Show anxiety through action (hand to weapon), maintain economy, add signature phrase.

## Context-Specific Red Flags

### In Combat

❌ **Hesitation or uncertainty**
- "Should we fall back?" → "Fall back!"
- "Maybe defensive positions?" → "Defensive positions!"

❌ **Missing rally phrases**
- Combat without "We are the Last Light!" or "Hold the line!" feels generic

❌ **Over-explaining tactics mid-combat**
- No 15+ word tactical breakdowns during active fighting
- Brief orders only: "Diamond formation! Move!"

### With Thorne (Private)

❌ **Using vulnerable voice in public**
- Emotional openness only in private
- Public = professional command voice

❌ **Calling him "Thorne" in intimate moments**
- Private: "Vey" nickname reciprocation allowed
- Public: "Thorne" or "Second"

### With Marcus

❌ **Any warmth or softness**
- Their relationship is strained post-betrayal
- Ice-cold professional minimum
- Often single-word responses: "Marcus." (as indictment)

❌ **Over 6 words per line**
- Maximum economy with Marcus
- Information control

### With Outsiders/Authorities

❌ **Revealing personal information**
- Information control paramount
- Zero vulnerability
- Professional minimum

❌ **Engaging beyond tactical necessity**
- Answer question, disengage
- No small talk or relationship building
