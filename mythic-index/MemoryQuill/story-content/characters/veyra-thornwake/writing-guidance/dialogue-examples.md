## Acceptable But Needs Revision (75-84)

### Example 7: Slightly Verbose
**Dialogue:** "I need you to check the northern perimeter and report back to me within the hour."

**Score:** 78/100

**Analysis:**
- **Vocabulary (20/25):** Appropriate lexicon ("northern perimeter"), no signature phrases
- **Syntax (15/25):** 15 words in single sentence - at upper limit for calm Veyra
- **Rhythm (18/25):** Complete sentence with clauses, lacks characteristic economy
- **Content (20/25):** Valid command but verbose for Veyra

**Issues:** Too wordy - violates economy principle. Should be: "North perimeter. Check it. Report in one hour."

**Revision:** "North perimeter. Check and report. One hour."
- Reduces to 7 words (hitting 7.2 avg)
- Fragments restore rhythm
- Maintains meaning with economy

## Voice Violations (Below 75)

### Example 8: Out-of-Character Hedging
**Dialogue:** "Perhaps we should consider moving the patrol schedule earlier? I think that might help, if you agree."

**Score:** 42/100

**Analysis:**
- **Vocabulary (8/25):** Hedging language violates voice ("perhaps," "I think," "might," "if you agree")
- **Syntax (10/25):** 16 words, question format inappropriate for commander
- **Rhythm (12/25):** Meandering, uncertain pacing
- **Content (12/25):** Seeking approval - violates commander authority

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ Hedging language (Veyra is decisive)
- ❌ Seeking approval (she gives orders, doesn't ask permission)
- ❌ Too many words (16 vs 7.2 target)
- ❌ No fragments or economy

**Correct Version:** "Move patrol earlier. Make it happen."
- 6 words (on target)
- Decisive command
- No hedging
- Economy restored

### Example 9: Flowery Metaphor
**Dialogue:** "The dawn breaks like a promise of hope across the horizon, reminding us that even in darkness, light will find its way."

**Score:** 35/100

**Analysis:**
- **Vocabulary (5/25):** Poetic language completely wrong for Veyra
- **Syntax (10/25):** 19 words, complex sentence, verbose
- **Rhythm (8/25):** Flowery, meandering, philosophical
- **Content (12/25):** Generic inspirational speech, not character-specific

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ Flowery metaphors (Veyra uses functional language only)
- ❌ Philosophical musing (not her style)
- ❌ Far too verbose (19 words vs 7.2)
- ❌ Zero signature phrases

**Context Note:** Veyra ONLY uses light/fire imagery when trauma-linked ("We are the Last Light," "burned," "ash"). Generic hope metaphors violate voice.
