---

## Calm/Command Context (60% - Baseline Voice)

**When:** Standard operations, routine commands, patrol orders, tactical discussions

**Statistical Profile:**
- **Words/line:** 6.1 avg (vs 7.2 overall) - **more economical** than average
- **Fragment usage:** 38% (higher than 34% overall)
- **Tone:** Professional, clipped, directive

### Characteristics

- **Maximum economy** - strips language to bare minimum
- **Imperative mood dominant** - orders, not explanations
- **Single-word commands frequent** - "Move." "Hold." "Report."
- **Minimal personal pronouns** - focuses on mission, not self
- **Signature phrases deployed casually** - "Square?" as routine confirmation

### Authentic Examples

**Example 1:** "Move out. Eyes sharp. Report anything unusual."
- 8 words, 3 sentences (2.7 words/sentence)
- All fragments/imperatives
- Zero pronouns
- Signature phrase: "Move out"

**Example 2:** "North perimeter needs checking. Thorne, you're on it. Hourly reports."
- 11 words, 3 sentences
- Fragments for directives
- Minimal words for task assignment

**Example 3:** "Clock's running. Move."
- 3 words, perfect economy
- Peak calm/command efficiency

### Writing Guidance

**Do:**
- Strip every unnecessary word
- Use fragments liberally (38%+)
- Deploy signature phrases naturally ("Square?" "Move out")
- Keep sentences under 8 words

**Don't:**
- Explain reasoning unless asked
- Use complete sentences when fragments work
- Include personal feelings or doubts
- Over 12 words per line

---

## Stressed/Combat Context (25% - Clarity Mode)

**When:** Active combat, crisis response, defensive situations, time-critical decisions

**Statistical Profile:**
- **Words/line:** 8.3 avg (vs 7.2 overall) - **slightly longer for clarity**
- **Fragment usage:** 28% (lower than 34% overall) - more complete sentences
- **Tone:** Urgent but controlled, loud (caps acceptable), repetitive for emphasis

### Characteristics

- **Clarity over economy** - adds words to prevent misunderstanding
- **Repetition for emphasis** - "HOLD" said twice, reinforcement
- **Signature rally phrases** - "We are the Last Light!" in crisis
- **Capitalization for volume** - "HOLD THE LINE!"
- **Complete sentences increase** - ensures orders understood in chaos
- **Morale + tactical combined** - identity invocation + directive

### Authentic Examples

**Example 1:** "Hold the line! We are the Last Light! We HOLD!"
- 9 words, 3 sentences
- Repetition of "hold" for emphasis
- Signature rally phrase deployed
- Caps for emphasis/volume

**Example 2:** "Perimeter's breached. North side. All units, defensive formation."
- 9 words, 3 sentences
- Assessment → Location → Order sequence
- Slightly longer for tactical clarity

**Example 3:** "FALL BACK! Controlled retreat to secondary position! NOW!"
- 9 words, 3 sentences
- Caps for urgency
- Tactical clarity ("controlled retreat," "secondary position")
- Temporal urgency ("NOW!")

### Writing Guidance

**Do:**
- Allow 8-10 words per line for tactical clarity
- Use caps for shouted orders in chaos
- Deploy rally phrases ("We are the Last Light!")
- Repeat key commands for emphasis
- Complete sentences when clarity critical

**Don't:**
- Go over 12 words per line (even in combat)
- Lose economy entirely - still clipped
- Skip signature phrases in major combat
- Hesitate or show uncertainty

### Combat-Specific Patterns

**Opening Engagement:**
"Contact! North wall! Defensive positions!"
- Announcement → Location → Order

**Rally/Morale:**
"We are the Last Light! We HOLD!"
- Identity → Command

**Retreat:**
"Fall back! Controlled withdrawal! Regroup at [location]!"
- Command → Qualification → Destination

## Vulnerable/Intimate Context (15% - Rare Openness)

**When:** Alone with Thorne, traumatic flashbacks, deep trust moments, emotional breaking points

**Statistical Profile:**
- **Words/line:** 11.4 avg (vs 7.2 overall) - **significantly longer**
- **Fragment usage:** 18% (much lower than 34% overall)
- **Tone:** Personal, haunted, unguarded

### Characteristics

- **Personal pronouns emerge** - "I lost them," "I can't"
- **Complete sentences dominant** - vulnerability expressed fully
- **Emotional content explicit** - "The fire took everything"
- **Past trauma referenced** - fire, loss, failure
- **Longer constructions** - allows processing emotion
- **Conditional/hypothetical language** - "I can't lose anyone else" (rare future fear)

### Authentic Examples

**Example 1:** "I lost them all. The fire took everything. I can't lose anyone else."
- 14 words, 3 sentences (4.7 words/sentence)
- Personal pronouns: "I" appears 3 times
- Trauma references: "lost," "fire," "took everything"
- Emotional content: grief, fear of repetition

**Example 2:** "Sometimes I still smell the smoke. It's not real, but it's there. Always there."
- 16 words, 3 sentences
- Sensory trauma detail
- Present tense vulnerability
- Repetition: "there" twice for emotional weight

**Example 3:** "You're the only one who knows. About the fire. About who I was before."
- 15 words, 3 sentences
- Trust acknowledgment (to Thorne)
- Past identity reference
- Fragments return at end (some economy maintained)

### Writing Guidance

**Do:**
- Allow 11-16 words per line
- Use personal pronouns ("I," "me")
- Reference past trauma explicitly
- Show emotional weight through longer constructions
- Deploy complete sentences for emotional processing
- **ONLY deploy in appropriate intimate contexts**

**Don't:**
- Use in public or with anyone except Thorne/closest allies
- Make her chatty or verbose beyond 16 words
- Remove all economy - she's vulnerable, not transformed
- Use with enemies, strangers, or formal settings
- Deploy without earned emotional context

### Critical Context Requirement

**⚠️ VULNERABILITY IS RARE AND EARNED**

This voice mode should appear in:
- Private moments with Thorne
- Trauma flashback sequences
- Life-or-death confessions
- Deep trust moments with core company members

**DO NOT use for:**
- Tactical discussions (even with Thorne)
- Public speeches or rallies
- Standard interactions
- Conversations with Marcus, leadership, or strangers

Overusing vulnerable voice **dilutes her character strength**.

## Relationship-Specific Variations

### With Thorne (Most Intimate)

**Professional (public):** Same as Calm/Command
- "Your call, Second." (defers to his expertise)
- "Thorne, assessment?" (seeks tactical input)

**Private (intimate):** Vulnerable voice activated
- Uses "Vey" nickname allowance
- Longer sentences (11+ words)
- Emotional content permitted
- Past trauma references

### With Marcus (Strained)

- **Shorter even than baseline** (under 6 words avg)
- **No warmth markers**
- **Increased coldness** - often single word responses
- **Minimal pronouns** - depersonalized
- Example: "Marcus." (just his name as indictment)

### With Company Members (Protective)

- **Baseline Calm/Command voice**
- **Signature phrases frequent** ("Square?" for confirmation)
- **Maternal undertones rare** but present in praise
- Example: "Good work. Squad's proud." (acknowledgment + unit pride)

### With Outsiders/Authorities

- **Maximum economy** (under 6 words)
- **Information control** - reveals nothing unnecessary
- **Cold professionalism**
- **Zero vulnerability**
- Example: "Understood. We'll handle it." (dismissive compliance)
