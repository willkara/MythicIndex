# Veyra Thornwake - Canon State Reference

**Purpose:** Track Veyra's knowledge states, active injuries, emotional state, and relationship evolution across timeline for continuity checking.

**Timeline Reference:** Canyon Incident = Day 0

---

## Knowledge States by Timeline Position

### Early Timeline (Week 1-2, Days 0-14)

**What Veyra Knows:**
- Canyon Incident details (her core trauma trigger)
- Company roster and capabilities
- Westwall Watchpost assignment
- Basic threat assessment of region

**What Veyra Doesn't Know:**
- Ignis's true fate (MAJOR continuity issue - flagged in phase4)
- Extent of enemy forces in region
- Full scope of canyon corruption
- Location of Echo (Vera Moonwhisper's brother)

### Mid Timeline (Month 1-3)

**What Veyra Knows:**
- Company operational status and losses
- Westwall defensive capabilities
- Regional political landscape
- Active threats and patterns

**What Veyra Doesn't Know:**
- Specific knowledge of Oakhaven abandonment details (happened while company was focused on Westwall)
- Full picture of enemy coordination (partially known)
- Extent of Echo's integration with company

### Late Timeline (Month 4+)

**What Veyra Knows:**
- Complete operational history of current deployment
- All major character evolutions and relationships
- Regional power structure
- Canyon incident aftermath details

**Knowledge Gate Rule:** If Veyra references something that contradicts her knowledge state at that timeline position, flag for revision.

## Active Injuries & Recovery Timeline

### Canyon Incident Injuries

**Primary:** [Check phase4 for specific Veyra injuries]
- **Recovery Status:** By Month 4, should be healed/scarred
- **Limitation:** None post-recovery

### Ongoing Strain (Transformation-Related)

**Vera's Wild Shape Strain (if co-scenes):**
- **Timeline:** Ongoing through narrative
- **Manifestation:** Exhaustion after extensive Wild Shape use
- **Recovery Period Needed:** 1-2 days rest between heavy transformations
- **Continuity Check:** If Vera uses Wild Shape on consecutive days in Months 2-3, flag for revision

### Writing Constraint

When writing Veyra scenes in Month 3+:
- [ ] No lingering canyon-incident injuries (should be healed)
- [ ] If recent combat damage: verify recovery timeline matches
- [ ] If Vera just wild-shaped: check Vera's recovery needs noted somewhere

## Relationship Evolution States

### Veyra ↔ Thorne

**Week 1-2:** Professional military partnership, tested trust
**Month 1-3:** Deepening trust, private intimacy emerging
**Month 4+:** Established intimate partnership, full trust
**Timeline Constraint:** Never regress to Week 1 formality in Month 3+ without specific cause

### Veyra ↔ Marcus

**Week 1-2:** Professional working relationship
**Month 1-3:** Tension increasing, trust eroding
**Month 4+:** Post-betrayal state (per phase4 flagged continuity issue - Ignis's fate connected)
**Timeline Constraint:** Relationship deteriorates; don't show sudden warmth without major reconciliation event

### Veyra ↔ Company

**Week 1-2:** Commander establishing authority
**Month 1-3:** Consolidated leadership, earned respect
**Month 4+:** Veteran commander, deep responsibility
**Timeline Constraint:** Her relationship with company deepens; younger members trust her more

### Veyra ↔ Vera

**Week 1:** First meeting context
**Month 1-2:** Integration into company
**Month 3+:** Established working relationship, protective dynamic
**Timeline Constraint:** Vera's obsession with Echo doesn't change; Veyra's protective nature toward her deepens

## Emotional State Progression

### Post-Canyon Trauma Recovery

**Week 1-2:** Raw, hypervigilant, protective overwhelm
**Week 3-4:** Functional but controlled
**Month 1+:** Managing trauma, focused on mission
**Month 4+:** Integrated trauma response, fewer flashbacks

**Writing Guideline:** Flashback frequency should decrease as timeline progresses (unless specific trauma trigger present)

## Continuity Checkpoints

### Pre-Writing Validation

Before writing Veyra scene, verify:
- [ ] Timeline position known (relative to Canyon Incident)
- [ ] Knowledge state consistent with timeline
- [ ] No impossible information (she can't know things that haven't happened yet)
- [ ] Injury status matches recovery timeline
- [ ] Relationship tone matches relationship evolution stage
- [ ] Emotional state plausible given timeline position

### Red Flag Triggers

🚩 **Veyra references something about Ignis** - Check phase4 flagged continuity issue
🚩 **Veyra suddenly warm toward Marcus** - Verify post-betrayal context (Month 4+)
🚩 **Vera just used Wild Shape yesterday, appears again today in major scene** - Check recovery timeline
🚩 **Veyra shows non-trauma-linked vulnerable moment early timeline** - Verify timeline position (rare Week 1-2)
