appearance: "Lily Blackwood is a petite young human woman of eighteen with a graceful build, captured in a moment of quiet focus. Her thick, golden-blonde hair is pulled back and woven into a long, heavy braid that rests over her left shoulder, catching the warm light. Her fair skin shows a soft, healthy flush on her cheeks, and her gaze remains downcast, intent on the task in her hands, obscuring her blue eyes. She wears a simple, textured bodice of dark greenish-brown wool with long sleeves over a gathered cream-colored chemise visible at the neckline. Her delicate hands are actively engaged in needlework, holding a needle and fine thread over a piece of white fabric. The overall impression is one of domestic serenity, warmth, and gentle concentration."
