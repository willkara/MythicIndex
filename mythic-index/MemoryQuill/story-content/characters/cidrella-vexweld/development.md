## Psychological Profile
*   **Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld (The Magical-Technical Innovator):** Born with wild sorcerous power, Cid's mind is a whirlwind of magical energy patterns, arcane-engineering schematics, and "impossible" fusion problems waiting to be solved. She is driven by the pure joy of discovering new ways to marry her innate chaotic magic with precise engineering. She joined the Company because rescuing people from "impossible" magical-technical situations presents the ultimate innovation challenges for someone born with magic but trained in engineering. Her confidence comes from her unique ability to channel inborn wild sorcerous power through technical genius to create solutions others consider impossible.
