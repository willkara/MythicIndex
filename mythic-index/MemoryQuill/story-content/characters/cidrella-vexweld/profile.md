# Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld - Profile

## Basic Information
- **Full Name**: Cidrella Vexweld
- **Aliases/Nicknames**: Cid
- **Race**: Rock Gnome
- **Class**: Sorcerer/Artificer (Magical-Technical Hybrid)
- **Role in Story**: Magical Engineer for the Last Light Company, combining innate sorcerous power with technical innovation
- **First Appearance**: Chapter 22 - Roots and Reconnaissance (warehouse visit)
- **Status**: Active (Last Light Company specialist in magical-technical fusion)

## Physical Description
- **Height/Build**: Short and sturdy, as is typical for a Rock Gnome, with a compact, muscular build from hauling metal and machinery.
- **Hair**: Unruly, short-cropped copper-red hair with a distinct blue streak, often pushed back by a pair of tinkerer's goggles perched on her forehead.
- **Eyes**: Sharp, intelligent brown eyes that sparkle with curiosity and focus. Her gaze is direct and misses nothing.
- **Distinguishing Features**: A light dusting of freckles across her nose and cheeks, often smudged with grease or soot. Simple ring piercings adorn her large, expressive gnomish ears. Her left arm is a masterwork of articulated brass and glowing conduits—a prosthetic she designed and built herself after her original was vaporized in a workshop accident.
- **Typical Clothing**: She prioritizes function over fashion. She typically wears a dark, oil-stained leather tunic and a heavy leather apron or cuirass over it, complete with numerous pockets and loops for tools. A bandolier holding large power cells or cartridges is always slung across her chest.

## Visual Summary
Cid is a rock gnome with a sturdy, compact build and a perpetually energetic appearance. Her short, unruly copper-red hair is accented by a bold blue streak, and she's rarely seen without her tinkerer's goggles. Her face, often smudged with grease, is dotted with freckles, and her large ears are adorned with simple ring piercings. Her most striking feature is the masterwork prosthetic left arm she engineered herself—a complex construction of brass and glowing conduits. She dresses for the workshop, wearing a functional, tool-laden leather cuirass and a bandolier of power cells.

  - Precision magical-mechanical engineering and fusion device fabrication
  - Pressure regulation systems enhanced with magical stability fields
  - Ventilation and structural systems incorporating protective enchantments
  - Complex magical-technical problem-solving and innovative hybrid designs

  - Creating magical-technical solutions that exceed purely mundane or magical approaches
  - Building devices that channel and focus raw magical energy safely
  - Engineering solutions for magical anomalies and extreme magical environments
- **Education Level**: Self-taught magical-technical fusion specialist with extensive experimental knowledge
- **Languages**: Common, Gnomish, some Draconic (for magical theory)
- **Combat Style**: Magical-technical fusion through custom-built channeling devices

## Personal Details
- **Habits**: Constantly tinkering with gadgets and improving equipment
- **Hobbies**: Creating and testing new inventions, solving complex technical puzzles
- **Personal Quarters**: A chaotic, two-story space known as "The Annex," connected to her main workshop by a clanking metal door. The ground floor is a secondary workbench, even more cluttered than her main one, dedicated to her most dangerous and experimental personal projects. A rickety, oil-stained spiral staircase leads up to a small loft, which is just big enough for a mattress and a chaotic pile of clothes. The room smells perpetually of ozone, soldering flux, and strange chemical reagents. Wires and arcane conduits run like vines along the walls, powering various half-finished contraptions that hum, click, and occasionally spark at all hours. Blueprints are tacked to every available surface, often overlapping in multiple layers. She uses this space for feverish, late-night invention, often grabbing a few hours of sleep on the mattress only when she physically collapses from exhaustion.
- **Likes**: Interesting technical challenges, elegant solutions to complex problems
- **Dislikes**: Mundane work, repetitive tasks, inefficiency
- **Fears**: TBD
- **Motivations**: The ultimate engineering challenge - finding new ways to marry chaotic magical power with precise technical control, solving "impossible" magical-technical problems

## Combat & Tactics
- **Primary Weapon System**: "Flitzragger" - multi-function magical-technical fusion device she's constantly upgrading. Channels her sorcerous power through engineered precision for effects like force bolts, arcane welding, reality-cutting beams, and "let's see what mode seven does!"
- **Power Source**: Back-mounted magical regulation array that stores and channels her own sorcerous energy through technical control systems - hums with barely-contained magical potential
- **Augmented Arm**: Magical-mechanical hybrid limb designed to regulate her power surges. Features rotating tool attachments, spell-focus crystals, and experimental magical-technical interfaces
- **Secondary Arsenal**: Belt of experimental magical-technical devices - some are smoke bombs, others are "probability manipulators" (she's constantly discovering what they actually do)
- **Armor**: Reinforced leather cuirass with built-in magical regulation circuits, covered in tool loops, component pouches, and attachment points for her endless gadgets
- **Fighting Style**: A dynamic process of engineering and improvisation. She doesn't "cast spells" but channels raw sorcerous power through her custom-built devices. Her magic is a collaborative, often argumentative, process between her innate power and her meticulously crafted tech. For example, instead of just casting 'Web,' she might slam a cartridge into her prosthetic arm, causing the arcane conduits to flare before erupting in a sticky, impassable net.
- **Signature Move**: "Chaos Protocol" - When deliberate plans fail, Cid can flip a guarded switch and allow her wild magic to surge through her technical systems. The results are spectacular and unpredictable, ranging from an enemy's sword turning into a bouquet of daisies to a nearby torch spontaneously singing a jaunty sea shanty.
- **Combat Philosophy**: "Magic plus engineering equals possibilities! If it explodes, that's just energetic data collection!"
- **Tactical Role**: Magical problem solver who creates impossible solutions by fusing raw sorcerous power with technical precision

## Psychological Response Matrix
- **In Crisis**: Gets MORE excited as danger increases - "Oh, this is INTERESTING!" - immediately starts designing magical-technical solutions that shouldn't be possible
- **During Negotiation**: Fidgets with Flitzragger settings while magical energy visibly courses through her arm's conduits, making everyone nervous
- **Moral Dilemma**: "But what if we tried..." - always has a third option involving experimental magical-technical fusion that's never been attempted
- **Team Conflict**: Builds magical gadgets to solve interpersonal problems ("I made a mood-stabilizing harmony generator!")
- **Under Personal Attack**: Takes notes for magical-technical improvements while her augmented arm shifts into defensive configurations
- **In Victory**: Immediately starts analyzing any magical phenomena present, testing interactions with her technical systems
- **Creative Surge Mode**: Jumps between magical experiments and technical projects simultaneously, often discovering unexpected magical-technical combinations

## Voice & Dialogue Patterns
- **Speech Style**: Rapid-fire technical explanations interrupted by new ideas, often mid-sentence
- **Signature Phrases**: 
  - "Oh, this is wonderful! Just wonderful!"
  - "I love the technical challenges!" 
  - "Each project is like a puzzle"
  - "You all have such an interesting energy. Very... purposeful."
  - "I just can't resist a good challenge!"
  - "Magically impossible, technically simple!"
- **Technical Tangents**: Explains while building with Flitzragger, forgetting others can't follow her mental leaps
- **Example Dialogue**: "Pass the spell-crystal—no the BLUE one that resonates at 847 arcane hertz—Flitzragger needs magical recalibration—OH! What if we routed my sorcerous energy through the secondary coils AND added a chaos-dampener? Never mind, trying it!"
- **Emotional Tells**: Talks faster when excited, magical energy pack hums louder when she's thinking hard, Flitzragger sparks with wild magic when she's frustrated, her augmented arm's conduits pulse brighter with strong emotions
- **Interruption Pattern**: Frequently interrupts herself with new ideas before finishing sentences
