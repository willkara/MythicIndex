# Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld - Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: Waterdeep
- **Birth Date**: TBD
- **Social Class**: Respected artisan/inventor class.
- **Cultural Background**: Rock Gnome culture with a strong emphasis on invention, practical magic, and intellectual curiosity.

## Family
- **Family Name**: Vexweld
- **Family Trade**: A respected line of jewelers and clockmakers known for their intricate, reliable, and predictable creations.
- **Family Dynamics**: Cid is the family's brilliant, exasperating black sheep. While they crafted beautiful, delicate mechanisms, she was trying to strap rockets to them. Her family loves her genius but is terrified by her methods. Her decision to leave and open her own shop was a mutual, loving relief for all involved.

## History
- **Education/Training**: 
  - Extensive education in arcane engineering and magical artifice, likely through a combination of formal schooling and apprenticeships.
- **Professional Career**:
  - **"Cid's Solutions & Salvage":** After leaving home, she founded a legendary shop in Waterdeep known for solving problems that conventional engineering couldn't touch. It catered to adventurers, wizards, and mercenary captains, earning her a reputation as a "battlefield inventor" not by contract, but by delivering custom, unconventional gear that worked—usually.
  - **The Arm Incident:** The loss of her arm was a landmark event. During an ambitious attempt to create a miniature, self-powering forge using a contained fire portal, a moment of impatience led her to skip a final diagnostic. The containment field flared, and a jet of pure elemental energy erupted, vaporizing her left arm in an instant of searing, agonizing pain. The initial aftermath was not one of cool analysis, but of shock and agony. However, during her recovery, the true Cid emerged. The horror of the event quickly gave way to the most fascinating engineering problem of her life, and she began sketching designs for an improved replacement. Her current prosthetic is a masterwork of articulated brass and glowing conduits.
- **The Turning Point (The "Silent Hand" Compound):**
  - During a high-stakes rescue mission, Korrath Threnx, a stoic Dragonborn engineer and frequent client, contacted Cid to inform her that a security system they had designed together was being used by the "Silent Hand" slaver ring to imprison children.
- **Joining the Company**:
  - Cid and Korrath took the lead on the infiltration of the "Silent Hand" compound, systematically dismantling their own creation. 
  - In the aftermath, Cid had a revelation. While Korrath found redemption, she found the most interesting, complex, and rewarding technical challenge of her life. She joined the Last Light Company not for moral reasons, but because she realized that rescue operations presented a constant stream of fascinating, "impossible" problems that no other line of work could offer.

## Personal Details
- **How She Relaxes**: She doesn't relax; she "optimizes." Her downtime is spent creating incredibly complex, Rube Goldberg-esque contraptions to perform simple tasks, purely for the joy of seeing a ridiculously complicated system she designed actually work.
- **Favorite Meal**: A "Tinker's Plate"—a chaotic assortment of small, flavorful foods she can eat with one hand while working with the other (pickled vegetables, smoked sausages, hard cheeses, nuts, etc.).
- **Favorite Drink**: Fizzy lightning-lime soda brewed in her workshop, complete with edible copper flakes. She swears the crackle on her tongue jump-starts her best ideas.
- **A Secret Hobby**: She is an avid participant in "Cog-Fighting," an underground gnomish sport where participants build and battle small, clockwork automatons. It's a perfect outlet for her competitive, inventive, and slightly chaotic nature.
- **Working with Korrath**: She genuinely enjoys her working relationship with Korrath Threnx. She sees his stubborn insistence on proven, methodical engineering as the ultimate, irresistible challenge. His rigid frameworks are the perfect "cage" for her chaotic genius to break out of. While his constant warnings about safety protocols can be exasperating, she secretly appreciates that his solid foundations give her a stable platform from which to launch her most outlandish and brilliant ideas.
