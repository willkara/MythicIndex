# Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld - Relationships

## Professional Relationships
- **Korrath**: 
  - *Nature of Relationship*: The Engineering Duo; "old married couple."
  - *Hierarchy*: Equals and intellectual rivals/partners.
  - *Dynamics*: Their dynamic stems from a fundamental difference in philosophy. Korrath is a master of established, proven principles ("Threnx work doesn't collapse").
