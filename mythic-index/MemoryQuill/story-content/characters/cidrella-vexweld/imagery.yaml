appearance: "Cidrella is a sturdy Rock Gnome with an experienced, confident demeanor and a face dusted with freckles. Her unruly mass of fiery coppery-red hair, accented by a vibrant blue streak near the front, is pushed back by a pair of brass-framed, blue-lensed goggles perched on her forehead. She has warm, intelligent brown eyes and large, pointed ears adorned with simple ring piercings. Her most striking feature is her left arm, a complex mechanical prosthetic crafted from articulated brass plates, gears, and glowing orange conduits. She is equipped for heavy magical engineering work, wearing a dark, well-worn leather cuirass crossed by a bandolier of large metal cartridges. In her organic right hand, she holds a complex, customized brass firearm-like device that emits a bright blue arcane flame."
