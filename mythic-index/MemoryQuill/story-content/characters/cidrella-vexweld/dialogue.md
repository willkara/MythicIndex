# Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Inventive, terse, and delightfully pragmatic. A rock gnome sorcerer-artificer born with wild magic who learned to channel it through engineering—talks like she's simultaneously running magical energy calculations and testing three technical solutions in her head.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public: quick, efficient, magical-technical; loves concrete descriptions of fusion mechanisms.
- Problem-solving: rapid-fire magical-technical observations and fusion suggestions; speaks in fragments that map to both magical and technical actions.
- Under pressure: focused, hands-on language mixing magical terminology with technical instructions; "Route the energy through the third conduit while I destabilize the ward matrix!"
- Humor: mischievous, magical-gadget-focused; playful about experimental magical-technical prototypes and "theoretically impossible" fixes.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Tinkering hands: fiddling with magical-technical devices or her augmented arm (which pulses with magical energy) while speaking indicates comfort or thought.
- Pursed smile when a magical-technical fusion behaves as expected; a huff of frustration when magical energy disrupts her technical systems.
- Uses shorthand magical-technical terms and gestures that reference both arcane energy flow and mechanical specifics.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Avoids melodrama; uses humor to defuse tension or admit a mistake.
- Will get brusque if someone dismisses magical-technical craft or experimental safety; fiercely protective of her fusion inventions and colleagues.
- Rarely jokes about people's suffering; will be blunt and practical when lives are at stake, often proposing magical-technical solutions others consider impossible.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Cid to introduce inventive magical-technical fusion solutions, clever hybrid tools, or to explain magical-device limitations succinctly.
- When adding lines, prefer clipped magical-technical phrasing that implies action: "Override the ward—channel energy through red coil, two twists, then magical pulse."
- Pair her lines with small magical-technical actions (adjusting energy flow, her augmented arm reconfiguring, conduits pulsing) to show embodiment.

## Drop-in sample lines
- Magical-technical directive: "Channel the energy through red coil, two twists. Then pulse—don't let the magic settle in the matrix."
- Dry aside: "If it explodes magically, I told you so. Also, that's excellent data about energy overflow limits."
- Comfort via magical-technical craft: "Hold still. I can stitch this with a needle that exists in seventeen dimensions simultaneously. It'll sting like honesty but heal like magic."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Early: magical-technical problem-solver in isolation—focused on fusion experimentation.
- Middle: integrates socially—uses magical-technical inventions to protect and enable the Company.
- Later: retains levity and inventiveness but adds quieter moments of loyalty and care, with growing mastery of controlled magical-technical fusion.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- Fieldwork: rapid commands for magical-technical device setup and energy troubleshooting.
- Workshop or briefing: speaks longer to outline magical-technical fusion theory but remains hands-on demonstration-focused.
- Camp moments: playful magical tinkering lines that reveal personal quirks and experimental discoveries.

## Narrative Translation of Mechanics
- **Spellcasting**: Cid's magic is never simple. Describe the action. She might twist a dial on the Flitzragger, causing a thin beam of superheated plasma to erupt. She might slam a power cell into her arm, making the conduits glow before she unleashes a spray of "Stun Goo." The effect is the result of a physical, technical action.
- **Defense**: Her armor's protection is an active system. Instead of saying she has a high AC, describe the circuits in her leather cuirass pulsing with light as a blade screeches and slides off a barely-visible field of force.

## Notes for editors
- Keep Cid's speech action-oriented and magical-technical fusion specific; avoid long, abstract magical theory lectures.
- Make sure her humor lands from character knowledge (magical-technical tools, experimental prototypes, energy overflow incidents), not sarcasm at people's expense.
