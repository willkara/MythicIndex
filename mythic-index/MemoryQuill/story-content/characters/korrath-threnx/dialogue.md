# Korrath "Wallbreaker" Threnx — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Practical, proud, and analytical. A military engineer who values precision, structure, and duty—speaks with the confidence of someone who has built and broken things for a living.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public: crisp and technical; often frames problems in terms of load, leverage, and angles.
- Instructional: calm, methodical—lays out step-by-step orders with clear rationale.
- Under pressure: steady, precise commands; less likely to shout, more likely to issue exact measurements and contingencies.
- Humor: dry, sometimes grim, often related to old engineering anecdotes or military irony.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Fingers sketching invisible lines in the air or tapping a surface to feel vibrations when thinking.
- Slight head-tilt when calculating; a short laugh is rare but warm.
- Uses tactile metaphors—bridges, keystones, joints—to describe people and plans.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Dislikes talk without plan; will push back on speculation without data.
- Uses humor to point out absurdity in plans that ignore fundamentals.
- Avoids mockery of sacrifice; respects practical courage.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Korrath to translate structural problems into clear actions—he provides the "how" for breaching, shoring, and structural improvisation.
- When adding lines, favor technical clarity: "Two wedges, staggered; drive the third at a forty-five degree angle."
- Pair short technical lines with small actions (measuring, tapping) to show embodiment of thought.

## Drop-in sample lines
- Technical directive: "Stagger the braces—left post two feet, right post three. Tighten until the hairline stops moving."
- Dry aside: "You can pry a lock or pry a problem—both take the right leverage."
- Encouraging: "Hold your end. A steady pull, not a frantic yank."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Introduced as a tactical specialist from a military engineering family.
- Grows more collaborative—teaches the Company to think structurally and to respect careful demolition and repair.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- Breaching planning: concise, numbered instructions that others can execute.
- Teaching moments: short, illustrated metaphors about building and failing safely.
- Quiet confidence: one-liners showing trust in team competence.

## Narrative Translation of Mechanics
- **Attacks**: Korrath's attacks are tactical. Instead of saying he uses a 'Trip Attack,' describe him shattering the flagstone in front of an enemy's leading foot, using his knowledge of physics to destroy their balance. A standard attack is a controlled arc designed to test the integrity of a shield or find the seam in a plate of armor.
- **Defense**: His resilience is a matter of control and discipline. Instead of saying he uses 'Second Wind,' describe him staggering back, taking a single, measured breath to assert control over the pain and slow the bleeding, his grip on 'Breacher' becoming firm once more.
- **Breath Weapon**: His dragonborn nature is a tool, not a wild power. Describe his lightning breath as a focused, sweeping beam, not a chaotic blast, used with the precision of an engineering tool.

## Notes for editors
- Keep Korrath concise and technically grounded. Avoid turning him into a walking lecture—let demonstrations and short commands carry the technical weight.
