## Basic Information
- **Full Name**: Korrath Threnx
- **Aliases/Nicknames**: Wallbreaker
- **Race**: Dragonborn (Bronze)
- **Class**: Fighter
- **Role in Story**: Master Siege Engineer, partner to Cidrella Vexweld, and future member of the Last Light Company
- **First Appearance**: TBD
- **Status**: Active

## Physical Description
- **Height/Build**: Tall and broad with the functional strength of someone who's hauled stone blocks and operated siege engines for decades
- **Scales**: Burnished bronze scales that darken to deep bronze around the edges, scarred from years of forge work and construction
- **Eyes**: A deep scar runs diagonally across his left eye from a construction accident - the eye still functions but serves as a permanent reminder of his profession's dangers
- **Distinguishing Features**: 
  - Massive but surprisingly dexterous hands, marked with fine scars from precision work with sharp tools
  - Family engineering guild crest worn on a heavy bronze chain - three interlocked gears beneath a hammer
- **Typical Clothing**: 
  - Well-maintained leather work clothes reinforced with metal plates at shoulders, forearms, and shins
  - Practical protection rather than decorative armor
  - Tool belt organized with geometric precision
- **Physical Condition**: Strong and functional, built for practical engineering work rather than show

## Visual References
- **Associated Images**: See [Image Descriptions](images/image_descriptions.md) for detailed visual descriptions of Korrath Threnx.

## Personality
- **Archetype**: The Engineer/Builder
- **Temperament**: Methodical, precise, professional
- **Positive Traits**: Meticulous, knowledgeable, committed to quality, honorable
- **Negative Traits**: Can be rigid in his methods, uncompromising on quality, can appear aloof due to intense focus.
- **Moral Alignment**: Lawful Good - focused on order, structure, and upholding the honor of his craft.

## Skills & Abilities
- **Expertise**: 
  - Military engineering
  - Siege weapons design and operation
  - Fortification construction and analysis
  - Structural integrity assessment
  - Security system design and neutralization
- **Special Abilities**: 
  - Can identify structural weaknesses with methodical precision
  - Capable of systematically dismantling his own security systems
  - Deep understanding of architectural integrity and design principles
- **Education Level**: Highly trained in family tradition of engineering excellence
- **Languages**: TBD
- **Combat Style**: Likely utilizes engineering knowledge in combat, possibly using tools as weapons

## Personal Details
- **Habits**: Checking and rechecking work, maintaining tools with exacting precision
- **Hobbies**: Breeding ornamental lizards, studying landscape art and architecture.
- **Personal Quarters**: A perfectly square room near the Siege-Works, built with exposed structural beams and precisely joined stonework. The furniture is heavy, functional, and made of dark, unadorned wood, all arranged at perfect right angles. The room is immaculately clean and organized. This room is a space of order and study. He uses it to draft and refine his blueprints, which are stored in meticulously labeled tubes on a large rack. The walls are decorated not with art, but with framed, hand-drawn architectural diagrams of famous fortresses and his own structural designs for the Bastion. A small section of one wall has been intentionally left as rough-hewn stone, which he uses as a personal testing ground for new mortar compounds and to study the effects of stress on different types of rock.
- **Likes**: Proper structural integrity, respect for craft, attention to safety protocols
- **Dislikes**: Shoddy workmanship, disrespect for proper procedure, cutting corners
- **Fears**: His work being used to cause harm; a stain on his family's honor.
- **Motivations**: Upholding his family's centuries-long tradition of engineering excellence and honor.

## Combat & Tactics
- **Primary Weapon**: "Breacher" - military siege maul with engineering modifications, counterweighted for both demolition and combat
- **Secondary Weapon**: Bronze dragon breath weapon (lightning) - used sparingly as last resort
- **Tools as Weapons**: Precision engineering tools repurposed for combat - measuring chains become restraints, calipers become pressure point weapons
- **Armor**: Reinforced leather work clothes with integrated metal plating - functional protection that allows for engineering work
- **Fighting Style**: A methodical application of force and physics. He analyzes the battlefield like a structure, identifying weaknesses in enemy formations or fortifications before applying precise force to dismantle them. He doesn't just hit things; he calculates and executes.
- **Signature Move**: "Structural Failure" - Korrath's signature move involves identifying a critical weak point—not in a person, but in their footing or formation. He might shatter a specific flagstone to unbalance a foe or strike a shield wall at the precise point to stagger the men on either side of the impact.
- **Combat Philosophy**: "Every structure has a weakness. A formation, a wall, an argument. I find the load-bearing point, and then I apply pressure."
- **Tactical Role**: Siege specialist who creates entry points and neutralizes fortifications

## Psychological Response Matrix
- **In Crisis**: Immediately identifies structural solutions and problems - sees everything as an engineering challenge
- **During Negotiation**: Silent, imposing presence like Thorne but analyzing room's exits and load-bearing walls
- **Moral Dilemma**: Considers long-term structural integrity of decisions - "Will this solution hold or collapse?"
- **Team Conflict**: Offers to rebuild relationships like structures - "Let me draft a solution"
- **Under Personal Attack**: Analyzes attacker's stance and movement for structural weaknesses
- **In Victory**: Inspects damage for future improvements, documents what worked and what didn't
- **Guilt Response**: When confronted with the misuse of his work, his focus will narrow to a single, intense objective: correction and restoration of honor.

## Voice & Dialogue Patterns
- **Speech Style**: Precise military engineering terminology, never approximates - exact measurements and specifications
- **Signature Phrases**: 
  - "Load-bearing" (his metaphor for important things/people)
  - "Threnx work doesn't collapse" (family pride)
  - "Seventeen degrees off vertical" (noting imperfections)
- **Military Formality**: Three-generation military tradition shows in formal address and proper protocol
- **Example Dialogue**: "The enemy's formation has three critical load-bearing points. Remove the sergeant at coordinates seven-three, structural collapse follows in forty seconds."
- **Professional Respect**: Like Thorne, maintains military bearing but defers to expertise - respects Cid's chaos because it works
- **Emotional Tells**: Touches family crest when discussing honor, breath weapon sparks slightly when truly angry

## Notes
- Third-generation military engineer whose family built siege weapons and fortifications for kingdoms.
- Went freelance as a contractor after wars ended, designing secure vaults and manor defenses.
- Operates with a strict code of honor: he builds what is commissioned, but his family's name is attached to the quality and integrity of the work, never its misuse.
- Takes immense pride in family engineering tradition - "Threnx work doesn't collapse."
- Has perfect working relationship with Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld.

### Public Perception
- Known as "Wallbreaker" for his ability to identify and dismantle structural weaknesses, a skill he demonstrated by predicting the collapse of the Yawning Portal's signpost.
- Highly respected for his meticulous engineering and commitment to quality, a testament to his family's long tradition.
- Works in a highly effective, if sometimes argumentative, partnership with Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld, building and repairing critical infrastructure.
