appearance: "Korrath Threnx is an imposing bronze dragonborn with a broad, powerful build carved by years of heavy labor. His scales are a burnished, deep bronze color, giving his weathered features the appearance of living metal, with prominent spiky frills sweeping back from his skull. His amber eyes hold a serious, steady gaze beneath heavy reptilian brow ridges. He is dressed for practical work in a dark, heavy leather tunic reinforced with functional metal pauldrons on his shoulders and thick straps across his chest. A massive, ornate bronze medallion displaying a relief of a fortified structure above a mechanical device hangs from a thick chain around his neck, signifying his trade. In his large, capable hands, he firmly grips the essential tools of a siege engineer: a heavy square-headed hammer in his right, and precision metal calipers in his left, projecting an aura of unwavering professional competence."
