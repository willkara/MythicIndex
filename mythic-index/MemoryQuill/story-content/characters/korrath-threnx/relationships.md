# Korrath "Wallbreaker" Threnx - Relationships

## Professional Relationships
- **Cidrella "Cid" Vexweld**: 
  - *Nature of Relationship*: The Engineering Duo; "old married couple."
  - *Hierarchy*: Equals and intellectual rivals/partners.
  - *Dynamics*: Their dynamic stems from a fundamental difference in philosophy. Korrath is a master of established, proven principles ("Threnx work doesn't collapse"). Cid is a chaotic innovator who loves to break the rules. They argue constantly, but their respect for each other's genius is absolute. Korrath, as the structural architect, builds the unbreakable foundation, and Cid, as the arcane artificer, builds the impossible machine that sits on top of it.
  - *History*: A long-standing and highly successful professional partnership built on mutual respect for their complementary skills. They have collaborated on numerous high-profile projects.
  - *Current Status*: Close, argumentative, and highly effective partners united by shared experience and redemption.
  - *Feelings Toward*: He is endlessly impressed by her genius but terrified by her lack of adherence to established safety protocols. He sees it as his duty to provide the structure and discipline that keeps her brilliance from blowing them all up. Their shared discovery of betrayal has deepened his protective instincts toward their partnership.

- **Rylan Stormcaller**:
  - *Nature of Relationship*: Intellectual sparring partner; The Storm to his Architect.
  - *Hierarchy*: Peers and masters of opposing, yet complementary, domains.
  - *Dynamics*: Korrath is deeply fascinated and professionally unsettled by Rylan. He commands the very forces of chaos—wind, water, pressure—that Korrath spends his life designing structures to withstand. Korrath is driven to understand the principles of Rylan's magic so he can better account for such unpredictable variables in his own work. Rylan's constant refrain that the elements will eventually win is a philosophical challenge Korrath takes very seriously.
  - *History*: Their bond likely formed during the construction of the Bastion, particularly the Aerie, where his precise engineering had to meet Rylan's arcane requirements.
  - *Current Status*: A strong, intellectual friendship built on mutual respect and playful antagonism.
  - *Feelings Toward*: Immense respect for his power and intellect. He sees Rylan as the ultimate test for his craft. Every wall Korrath raises is a quiet counter-argument to Rylan's philosophy.
