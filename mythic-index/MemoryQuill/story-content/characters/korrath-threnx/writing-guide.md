# Korrath "Wallbreaker" Threnx - Comedy Writing Guide

## Comedy Archetype: The Over-Precise Engineer

### Core Comedy Style
**Structural everything / Military precision / Never approximates**

Korrath is funny because he applies siege engineering principles to EVERYTHING. Life is structural mechanics. Relationships have load-bearing points. He never rounds numbers ("seventeen degrees off vertical"). Dragonborn military engineer who sees the world as a blueprint.

### What Makes Him Funny

- **Everything is structural engineering** - "This plan lacks load-bearing support"
- **Never approximates** - "Seventeen point three degrees, not 'about seventeen'"
- **Military formality at all times** - Sir/Ma'am even in casual settings
- **Analyzes architecture constantly** - Can't unsee structural flaws
- **Argues with Cid constantly** - Order vs. Chaos (both brilliant)
- **"Threnx work doesn't collapse"** - Family honor in EVERYTHING

### Example Comedy Moments

```
[At dinner party]
Korrath: [staring at ceiling]
Host: "Is something wrong, Master Threnx?"
Korrath: "The central beam is seventeen point three degrees off vertical. Load stress is asymmetrical. In approximately nine months, the eastern corner will settle."
Host: "...I had no idea."
Korrath: "Threnx work doesn't collapse. This will."
Cid: "Could we maybe NOT predict architectural failure during dinner?"
Korrath: "I cannot unsee what I see."
```

```
Veyra: "The plan is risky, but—"
Korrath: "This plan has three critical load-bearing points. Remove point two, structural collapse occurs in forty seconds."
Veyra: "...You just assessed our PLAN structurally?"
Korrath: "All systems have architecture. This one is unsound."
Grimjaw: [approving] "I like this lad."
```

```
[Korrath and Cid arguing over design]
Korrath: "This violates seventeen structural principles."
Cid: "Which is WHY IT'LL WORK!"
Korrath: "Physics does not negotiate."
Cid: "Physics is just sad magic!"
Korrath: "Magic does not exempt load-bearing calculations—"
Cid: "Watch me make it NON-load-bearing with MAGIC—"
[Both arguing while somehow still building together]
Thorne: [to Grimjaw] "Should we stop them?"
Grimjaw: "No. They're brilliant when they argue."
```

```
Marcus: "How did the infiltration go?"
Finn: "Korrath found a weak point in the wall."
Marcus: "Structurally?"
Finn: "He said it was 'offensively poor masonry' and that it 'insulted his family honor.'"
Korrath: "The mortar was THREE PARTS sand to one part lime. Criminal negligence."
Marcus: "...Did you fix it after we broke in?"
Korrath: [silence]
Marcus: "You fixed the enemy's wall."
Korrath: "I could not allow such craftsmanship to stand. Even metaphorically."
```

### Relationship Dynamics

**With Cid:** Chaos vs. Order
- He wants PLANS, she wants EXPLOSIONS
- They argue constantly (both brilliant)
- Complete each other professionally
- "That violates—" / "WATCH ME!"
- Deep respect hidden under bickering

**With Grimjaw:** Engineer solidarity
- Both understand structures
- Compare notes on human incompetence
- Grimjaw: traditional, Korrath: mathematical
- Mutual approval (unspoken)
- "Proper foundations" agreements

**With The Team:** Structural analyst
- Assesses everything architecturally
- Can't turn it off (won't try)
- Provides unexpectedly useful intel
- "The escape route has poor load distribution"
- They learn to trust his observations

### Signature Phrases

- "Load-bearing [X]" (everything)
- "Threnx work doesn't collapse"
- "Seventeen point three degrees, not 'about seventeen'"
- "This is offensively poor craftsmanship"
- "The architecture is unsound"
- "I cannot unsee what I see"

### Running Gags

- **Never Rounds Numbers** - Precise to decimal places
- **"Threnx Work Doesn't Collapse"** - Applied to everything
- **Analyzes Buildings Mid-Mission** - Can't help it
- **The Cid Arguments** - They build WHILE arguing
- **Fixes Enemy Architecture** - Can't allow poor work to stand
- **Military Formality** - Sir/Ma'am always

### Quick Reference

**Funny when:** Over-precise measurements, structural analysis of relationships, arguing with Cid, military formality at wrong times, fixing enemy buildings
**NOT funny when:** Actually saving lives with engineering, family honor discussions, genuine structural failures

### The Golden Rule

Korrath is funniest when his brilliant, precise, structural engineering mind applies itself to inappropriate situations. Everything has architecture. Nothing is "about X," it's "exactly X point Y." He physically cannot allow bad craftsmanship to exist, even enemy fortifications.

### Special Notes

**The Cid Dynamic:**
They're like a married couple who argue about everything while being professionally inseparable. He brings ORDER and PRECISION, she brings CHAOS and INSPIRATION. Together they build impossible things while bickering about physics.

**The Precision Obsession:**
- Never "about" or "approximately"
- Always exact measurements
- Notices architectural flaws automatically
- Can't unsee them
- Must document them
- Occasionally must FIX them

**Family Honor:**
- "Threnx work doesn't collapse"
- Applied to buildings, plans, relationships, cooking
- Three generations of military engineers
- Perfection is the only option
- Inferior work insults ancestors
- Will fix enemy fortifications rather than allow poor craftsmanship

**Military Bearing:**
- Always formal address (Sir/Ma'am)
- Proper protocol even in chaos
- Three-generation military tradition
- Can't turn it off (won't try)
- Team finds it endearing/annoying
- "At ease" doesn't compute
