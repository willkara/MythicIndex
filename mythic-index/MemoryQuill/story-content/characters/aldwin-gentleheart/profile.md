The air is thick with the comforting aroma of dried herbs, spices, and brewing tea. The curved walls are lined with floor-to-ceiling shelves, holding hundreds of meticulously labeled ceramic jars and wooden boxes. This is his personal laboratory and sanctuary. He finds peace in the quiet, methodical work of his craft. A large, comfortable armchair sits at the center of the room, facing a low table with a beautiful, well-used ceramic tea set. This is where he performs his personal tea ceremonies to center himself after a difficult healing session.
