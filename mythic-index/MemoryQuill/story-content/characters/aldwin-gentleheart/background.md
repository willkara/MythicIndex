- **Siblings**: TBD
- **Extended Family**: Comes from a long lineage of healers.
- **Family Dynamics**: His family taught him the foundations of healing, but he diverged from their path, pursuing formal academic training.

## History

  - *Notable Acquaintances*: During his studies, he occasionally attended cross-disciplinary lectures on arcane theory, where he was briefly acquainted with a brilliant, if eccentric, elven elementalist named Rylan Ashvale. He remembers being fascinated by his theories on how atmospheric pressure could affect somatic components, though he found his approach a bit too detached for his own tastes.
  
- **Adolescence/Young Adulthood**:
  - *Key Events*: Left his village to pursue higher education, a rare choice for a halfling of his community.
  - *Relationships*: Developed connections within the academic community of Waterdeep.
  - *Choices & Consequences*: His choice of a scholarly path over traditional healing created a respectful distance with his family, but provided him with the skills that would later save countless lives.
  
- **Major Life Events**:
  - *Event 1*: Outbreak of the Border Wars.
  - *Event 2*: Voluntarily enlisted as a field medic, motivated by a deep philosophical conviction to serve where the need was greatest.
  - *Event 3*: Earned the title "Brother" from the soldiers who, moved by his unwavering compassion, adopted him as their own family.
  - *Event 4*: Post-war return to village life, where he found himself dissatisfied with the quiet pace and lack of profound purpose.
  - *Event 5*: The Plague of the Gray Rot - A virulent plague swept through a remote, quarantined village that had been abandoned by official aid. Aldwin, feeling a pull of duty, traveled there to offer what help he could.
  - *Event 6*: The Joining - In the heart of the plague-stricken village, he met Veyra Thornwake and Thorne Brightward. He witnessed Veyra's unwavering dedication to not just healing the sick, but providing dignity to the dying and remembering the fallen. Recognizing a kindred spirit, he approached her and offered his skills, not as a hireling, but as a colleague, becoming the first crucial specialist to join the nascent Last Light Company.

## How They Got Here
- **Reason for Current Situation**: After the intensity of the Border Wars, Aldwin found himself unable to readjust to the quiet life of a village healer. He felt a deep sense of stagnation, his profound skills and philosophical convictions going unused. The Plague of the Gray Rot was the catalyst he needed, a call to a higher purpose. Witnessing Veyra's mission in action, he saw the perfect synthesis of his wartime experience and his innate compassion. He joined the Last Light Company because it was the only place where his unique blend of healing, philosophy, and unwavering presence in the face of suffering would be truly valued.

## Personal Details
- **How He Relaxes**: The meticulous, sensory process of preparing tea—selecting leaves, grinding herbs, heating water to a precise temperature—is a form of meditation for him. It is a quiet, grounding ritual that allows him to center himself and process the pain he witnesses daily.
- **Favorite Meal**: Honey-glazed river trout with a side of wild greens and toasted seeds. It's a dish that bridges the two halves of his life: the simple, wholesome ingredients are reminiscent of his halfling village, while the refined preparation speaks to the palate he developed during his academic years.
- **Favorite Drink**: Wildflower tisane steeped with clover honey and a sprig of lemon balm. He shares it with patients at twilight, letting the gentle sweetness ease them into rest.
- **Family Connection**: He carries a small, worn, leather-bound book filled with pressed flowers and herbs from the fields around his home village, a gift from his mother. On difficult nights, he opens it, the faint scent of home a silent connection to the family and the simpler form of healing he evolved from.
