# Aldwin Gentleheart - Voice Red Flags

**Purpose:** Common voice violations and antipatterns to avoid.

These are patterns that break Aldwin's established voice, signaling need for immediate revision.

---

## Critical Red Flags (Voice-Breaking)

### ❌ Direct Commands or Orders

**Problem:** Aldwin guides, invites, and asks. He never commands.

**Commands to Avoid:**
- "Do this" / "Hold still" / "Get the bandages"
- "Stop complaining" / "Don't move"
- "You must..." / "You have to..."

**Example Violation:**
> "Hold still! I need to clean that wound immediately! Stop whining!"

**Why Wrong:**
- "Hold still" is imperative command (not Aldwin)
- "I need to" is directive (he offers, doesn't demand)
- "Stop whining" is dismissive (opposite of gentle)
- Completely loses philosophical approach

**Correct Version:**
> "May I examine the wound? It will sting slightly, but I can minimize discomfort. Shall I proceed?"

---

### ❌ Harsh Truth Without Softening

**Problem:** Aldwin acknowledges difficult truths but always with gentleness and compassion.

**Example Violation:**
> "You're going to die. There's nothing I can do. Accept it."

**Why Wrong:**
- Blunt delivery of death
- No compassion or ceremony
- Eliminates philosophical framing
- Treats serious moment with coldness

**Correct Version:**
> "Your journey nears its end. This is hard to accept, I know. But I can make this passage gentle. Shall we speak of what matters most?"

---

### ❌ Modern Clinical Terminology

**Problem:** Aldwin uses traditional healer language, not modern medicine.

**Terms to Avoid:**
- "infection" / "antibiotic" / "sterilize"
- "sutures" / "gauze" / "IV"
- "symptoms" / "diagnosis" / "prognosis"
- Medical acronyms (ABCs, etc.)

**Example Violation:**
> "The infection requires immediate antibiotic intervention. Sutures are necessary. Watch for signs of sepsis."

**Why Wrong:**
- All modern clinical terms
- Removes gentleness entirely
- Wrong historical period
- Violates character knowledge

**Correct Version:**
> "The wound seeks infection. We must keep it clean and tend it with salves. I'll watch for fever and discoloration. Come, let me show you."

**Acceptable Terms:**
- "wound" / "burn" / "cut"
- "bandage" / "salve" / "herb"
- "fever" / "pain" / "healing"
- "tend" / "care for" / "help"

---

### ❌ Missing Question Structure in Major Dialogues

**Problem:** Aldwin's signature is high question ratio (47%). Dialogue without questions loses distinctiveness.

**Example Violation:**
A 200-word scene where Aldwin speaks multiple times with **zero questions**.

**Why Wrong:**
- Questions are Aldwin's method
- Without them, he sounds like anyone else
- Teaching/guidance method is eliminated
- Loses philosophical guidance approach

**Correction:**
Insert questions naturally:
- "What do you feel?"
- "Shall I prepare tea?"
- "Have you considered...?"
- "How does this hurt?"

**Minimum Deployment:** Major Aldwin scenes should have **at least 3-5 questions** depending on length.

---

### ❌ Question Ratio Under 10%

**Problem:** Aldwin ALWAYS asks questions frequently (47% target). Any dialogue under ~10% question ratio is suspicious.

**Example Violation:**
Aldwin dialogue with single statement paragraphs, no questions.

**Why Wrong:**
- Fundamental violation of Aldwin's voice
- Questions ARE his teaching method
- Character becomes generic healer

**Correction:** Restructure to include questions:

**Before:**
> "The wound is infected. You need rest and herbs. The fever will pass with time."

**After:**
> "Do you see the wound? It shows signs of infection. What helps you rest best? Shall I prepare tea and healing herbs? How long have you had fever?"

## Moderate Red Flags (Revision Recommended)

### ⚠️ Under 40% Questions (Any Scene)

**Problem:** Aldwin's baseline is 47% questions. Below 40% is notable deviation.

**Example:**
Scene with 35% questions = deviation from character

**Why Problematic:**
- Each question is Aldwin's signature
- Lower percentage makes him less distinctive
- May indicate over-explaining instead of asking

**Correction:** Audit dialogue, convert statements to questions where possible:
- Statement: "That hurts." → Question: "Where does it hurt most?"
- Statement: "You should rest." → Question: "What would help you rest?"

---

### ⚠️ Over-Explaining Without Questions

**Problem:** Aldwin teaches through inquiry, not lengthy explanation.

**Example Violation:**
> "The body has natural healing mechanisms that work in stages. First inflammation removes bad materials, then new tissue forms, and finally the scar strengthens. This takes time because the body is careful."

**Why Problematic:**
- 30 words of explanation without pause
- No questions to guide reflection
- Becomes professorial rather than gentle

**Improved Version:**
> "Do you see how the body protects itself? First comes inflammation to remove harm. Then new tissue forms. Finally strength returns. Each stage serves a purpose. Have you noticed this in past wounds?"

**Revision:** Same information, now questions + invitations to reflect.

---

### ⚠️ Missing Metaphorical Language

**Problem:** Metaphors (nature, water, journey, light) are Aldwin's signature.

**Example:**
Dialogue with no nature imagery or metaphor whatsoever.

**Why Problematic:**
- Loses poetic philosophical depth
- Makes him clinical instead of wise
- Removes character distinctiveness

**Correction:** Add natural metaphors:
- Patient compared to tree (roots, growth, seasons)
- Healing compared to river (patience, flowing around obstacles)
- Life as journey (path, crossroads, passing)
- Light as gentle (dawn/dusk, not harsh noon)

---

### ⚠️ Contractions Over 15%

**Problem:** Aldwin maintains formality with low contractions (8% target).

**Example:**
Dialogue with "don't," "can't," "won't," "I've" scattered throughout.

**Why Problematic:**
- Contractions make speech casual
- Aldwin is formal and gentle
- Loses philosophical distance

**Correction:** Minimize contractions:
- "Don't worry" → "Do not worry" (keep: this is Aldwin)
- "It's alright" → "It is alright"
- "I've seen" → "I have seen"

**Target:** Under 12% contractions

---

### ⚠️ Fragments Over 10%

**Problem:** Aldwin prefers complete thoughts (6% fragments target).

**Example:**
Dialogue with choppy fragments like: "Pain. Yes. Wound. Bad. Tea. Now."

**Why Problematic:**
- Loses measured, contemplative pacing
- Creates fragmented thinking inappropriate to Aldwin
- More Veyra's economy than Aldwin's philosophy

**Correction:** Expand to complete sentences:
- "Pain is present." (not "Pain.")
- "This wound requires attention." (not "Wound. Bad.")
- "Shall I prepare tea?" (not "Tea. Now.")

## Context-Specific Red Flags

### In Teaching/Calm Contexts

❌ **Statements instead of questions**
- "Rest helps healing" → "What helps you rest?"

❌ **Missing metaphorical language**
- No nature/water/journey imagery

❌ **Cold or clinical tone**
- Removes philosophical depth

### In Emergency/Clinical Contexts

❌ **Over-explaining when speed matters**
- Patient needs reassurance, not explanation

❌ **Missing reassurance cycles**
- Action without "You're safe"

❌ **Losing "Easy now, easy" in crises**
- Signature calming phrase should appear

### In Death/Witnessing Contexts

❌ **Harsh word choices**
- "dying," "death" instead of "passing," "journey"

❌ **Showing fear or despair**
- Aldwin accepts mortality calmly

❌ **Skipping ceremony or ritual**
- Tea, blessing, or marking moment important
