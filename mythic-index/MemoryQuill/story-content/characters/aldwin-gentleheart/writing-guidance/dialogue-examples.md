## Acceptable But Needs Revision (75-84)

### Example 7: Over-Complex Philosophy
**Dialogue:** "The epistemological framework of suffering comprises both physical manifestation and psychological constituent elements that interact in complex ways with our phenomenological experience."

**Score:** 68/100

**Analysis:**
- **Vocabulary (12/25):** Modern academic language completely wrong for Aldwin
- **Syntax (14/25):** 22 words but overly complex, jargon-heavy
- **Rhythm (16/25):** Ponderous, intellectualized, loses gentleness
- **Content (10/25):** Philosophy exists but hidden in academic language

**Issues:** Academic jargon violates Aldwin's gentle, accessible philosophy

**Revision:** "What is this suffering composed of? Physical pain is one thread. Emotional weight is another. Do they weave together?"
- Becomes 16 words
- Uses simple language
- Maintains philosophical inquiry
- Restores gentleness

### Example 8: Harsh Medical Directive
**Dialogue:** "Get the infected wound cleaned. Use carbolic acid. Stop whining and hold still."

**Score:** 35/100

**Analysis:**
