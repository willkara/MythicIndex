His healing is not just medicinal; it's philosophical. The tea ceremony is a ritual to impose calm and order on the chaos of suffering. He carries the weight of every difficult decision, every life he couldn't save, but he bears it with quiet dignity. He is the Company's moral and spiritual anchor.
