## How They Got Here
- **Reason for Current Situation**: For fifteen years, Thorne had dedicated his life to the City Guard, finding immense satisfaction in its structure and the clear-cut pursuit of justice. However, witnessing Veyra's raw, unyielding commitment to "no one left behind"—a commitment that transcended laws and procedures—shattered his comfortable worldview. He saw the limitations of the Guard's bureaucracy, its inability to pursue cases beyond its jurisdiction, or to dedicate resources to those deemed "lost causes." He wasn't disillusioned with the Guard itself, but with its inherent constraints. Veyra's vision offered a path to a higher, more direct form of service—one where the mission was paramount.
- **Path to Current Location**: Thorne leveraged his long-standing relationships and impeccable record to ensure his departure was on excellent terms. He framed his new endeavor as a specialized, independent asset that could *complement* the City Watch's efforts. He transitioned directly from his captaincy to becoming Veyra's second-in-command, his initial role being crucial in establishing the Company's operational procedures, training protocols, and logistical networks, transforming Veyra's raw vow into a functional, professional organization.
- **Goals Prior to Story Start**: 
  - Successfully transitioned from city guard to Last Light Company.
  - Established effective operational procedures for the company.

## Personal Details
- **How He Relaxes**: His relaxation is a form of disciplined maintenance. He spends his downtime meticulously caring for his gear—polishing his shield until it gleams, sharpening his longsword with a whetstone, and oiling the leather straps of his armor. This quiet, repetitive ritual is a form of meditation for him, a way to create order and readiness in a chaotic world.
- **Favorite Meal**: A simple but perfectly cooked steak and a baked potato. It's the kind of honest, unpretentious meal he likely ate in the officer's mess for years. It's not about fancy flavors, but about quality and reliability—two virtues he values above all others.

His quarters contain a small, carefully curated collection of books on famous battles, legendary commanders, and tactical theory.
