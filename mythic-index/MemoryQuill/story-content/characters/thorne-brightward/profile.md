- **Personal Quarters**: A perfectly rectangular room located in the Establishment terrace, with a window overlooking the main training grounds of the Great Courtyard. The design is one of pure, unadorned functionality. The floor is bare, scrubbed wood. The bed is a simple timber frame with a coarse but clean linen sheet, folded with geometric precision. This is the room of a soldier, not a commander. It is his personal barracks, a space to maintain the discipline he believes keeps him and others alive. Every morning, he rises before the sun to watch the guards begin their drills from his window. His armor and weapons are meticulously displayed on a custom-made stand, not as trophies, but as tools laid out for inspection. A small, perfectly organized desk holds his journals, filled with neat, precise script detailing after-action reports and personal reflections. The only decoration is a framed writ on the wall—his former commission as a Captain of the Waterdeep City Guard, a reminder of a different kind of service.

- His horn signal is a widely recognized promise of professional help, signifying the arrival of the Last Light Company.
- Seen as the "rock" and "shield" of the Company, ensuring solid plans and the safe return of everyone.
