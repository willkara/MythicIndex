## Psychological Profile
*   **Thorne Brightward (The Bulwark):** He is a man of structure and duty, finding comfort and meaning in order and procedure. His past as a City Guard Captain wasn't just a job; it was his identity. He is loyal to Veyra not just as a commander, but because her mission gives his tactical mind a higher purpose than just "enforcing laws." He is the pragmatist who makes Veyra's idealism possible. His internal conflict arises when the "right thing" (the mission) conflicts with the "right way" (the rules).
