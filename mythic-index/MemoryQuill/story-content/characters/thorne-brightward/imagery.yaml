appearance: "Thorne Brightward is a broad-shouldered human male with the weathered, deeply lined face of a seasoned veteran in his late middle age. His steel-grey hair is cropped short in a disciplined military fashion, accompanied by a thick, prominent grey mustache over a stern mouth. His deep-set dark brown eyes gaze out with a watchful, stoic intensity beneath heavy brows. He is encased in dark, functional plate armor worn over chainmail, partially covered by a heavy, textured blue wool cloak that is clasped at the throat with a round metal brooch. A distinct golden sunburst sigil within a shield emblem is emblazoned on the cloak's left shoulder, marking his allegiance. In his right gauntleted hand, he holds a brass lantern that casts a warm light on his armor, while his left hand grips the top edge of a large shield. He projects an aura of unwavering stability and experienced command."
