## Acceptable But Needs Revision (75-84)

### Example 7: Over-Explained Order
**Dialogue:** "I think we might want to consider implementing a defensive perimeter because it would provide us better tactical advantages if the enemies decide to attack from multiple directions simultaneously."

**Score:** 71/100

**Analysis:**
- **Vocabulary (18/25):** Professional but hedging ("might want to consider")
- **Syntax (12/25):** 27 words in single sentence - far exceeds 11.4 target
- **Rhythm (16/25):** Meandering, over-structured
- **Content (15/25):** Valid tactical point but over-explained

**Issues:** Too much hedging, too verbose, loses military precision

**Revision:** "Defensive perimeter. Better tactical positioning against multi-directional assault."
- Reduces to 11 words (on target)
- Removes hedging
- Maintains tactical accuracy

## Voice Violations (Below 75)

### Example 8: Casual Slang
**Dialogue:** "Hey, looks like we gotta set up a defensive thing. It'd be pretty cool if we could get higher ground, right? What do you think, boss?"

**Score:** 38/100

**Analysis:**
- **Vocabulary (8/25):** Casual slang ("gotta," "thing," "cool," "boss") completely wrong for Thorne
- **Syntax (12/25):** Casual structure, question tag ("right?"), seeking consensus
- **Rhythm (10/25):** Conversational, unprofessional
- **Content (8/25):** Treats Veyra as peer, not commander

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ "gotta" (contracted informal - not Thorne)
- ❌ "thing" (vague, unprofessional)
- ❌ "cool" (casual, young)
- ❌ "right?" (seeking agreement inappropriately)
- ❌ "boss" (camaraderie tone, wrong hierarchy)

**Correct Version:** "Defensive perimeter established. Request higher ground for tactical advantage. Awaiting orders."

### Example 9: Emotional Without Structure
**Dialogue:** "I'm feeling really worried about this and honestly I'm scared we're going to fail and I don't know what to do."

**Score:** 32/100

**Analysis:**
- **Vocabulary (5/25):** Emotional labels, no military language, no signature phrases
- **Syntax (8/25):** 20 words, rambling emotional outpouring
- **Rhythm (8/25):** Anxious, scattered pacing
- **Content (5/25):** Completely out-of-character emotional dump

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ Emotional labels ("scared," "worried")
- ❌ Rambling structure (no tactical framework)
- ❌ Seeks reassurance (not his role)
- ❌ Zero professionalism

**Context:** Even in private with Veyra, Thorne would structure emotion through situation assessment, not raw feelings.
