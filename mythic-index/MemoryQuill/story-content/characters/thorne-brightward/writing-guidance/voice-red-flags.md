# Thorne Brightward - Voice Red Flags

**Purpose:** Common voice violations and antipatterns to avoid.

These are patterns that break Thorne's established voice, signaling need for immediate revision.

---

## Critical Red Flags (Voice-Breaking)

### ❌ Casual Slang or Modern Speech

**Problem:** Thorne is a military professional. Modern casual language completely breaks voice.

**Words to Avoid:**
- "gotta" / "gonna" / "wanna"
- "cool" / "awesome" / "dope"
- "thing" / "stuff" / "kinda"
- "yeah" / "nope" (instead of "yes" / "no")
- "boss" / "buddy" / "dude"

**Example Violation:**
> "Hey, that's gonna be pretty cool, right? We should totally check it out."

**Why Wrong:**
- Casual contractions ("gonna," "totally")
- Colloquial adjectives ("cool")
- Seeking agreement inappropriately ("right?")
- 11 words but no military structure

**Correct Version:**
> "Assessment: reconnaissance recommended. Standard protocol applies."

---

### ❌ Hedging Language (Unless Vulnerable)

**Problem:** Thorne offers expertise confidently. Hedging undermines command authority.

**Hedging Words to Avoid:**
- "I think" / "I believe" / "I feel like"
- "maybe" / "perhaps" / "possibly"
- "might" / "could" / "sort of"
- "if you agree" / "if that's okay"

**Example Violation:**
> "Maybe we could possibly consider setting up a defensive position? If you think that's a good idea, I mean."

**Why Wrong:**
- Three hedge markers ("maybe," "could possibly," "if you think")
- Questions expertise
- Seeks approval inappropriately
- Loses command presence

**Correct Version:**
> "Defensive positions recommended. Tactical advantage significant."

**Exception:** Only in truly vulnerable private moments with Veyra:
- ✅ "I don't know if I can do this, Vey." (emotional vulnerability)
- ❌ "Maybe we should try a different formation?" (tactical uncertainty)

---

### ❌ Direct Orders to Veyra

**Problem:** Thorne is Second-in-Command. He offers assessments, not commands.

**Example Violation:**
> "You need to send Grimjaw north immediately."
> "We should move now. That's what has to happen."

**Why Wrong:**
- Thorne commands subordinates, not Veyra
- Removes her authority
- Violates command structure

**Correct Version:**
> "Assessment: Northern deployment recommended immediately. Your call, Commander."

**Exception:** Private moments with Veyra, personal care:
- ✅ "You need to rest, Vey. Non-negotiable." (care, not command)
- ❌ "You need to attack now." (tactical command - never)

---

### ❌ Missing Unit Address in Combat

**Problem:** "Patrol, [command]" is Thorne's signature frame. Combat without it loses distinctiveness.

**Example Violation:**
A 200-word combat scene where Thorne gives 5+ orders without once using "Patrol, [cmd]" format.

**Why Wrong:**
- Loses signature identity marker
- Generic military voice instead of Thorne-specific
- Unit doesn't hear their unit address (disorienting)

**Correction:**
- Combat orders must use "Patrol, [cmd]" frame:
  - "Patrol, to me!"
  - "Patrol, defensive positions!"
  - "Patrol, hold the line!"

---

### ❌ Calling Veyra "Vey" in Public

**Problem:** "Vey" is private-only nickname. Public use undermines formality and hierarchy.

**Example Violation:**
> In front of the company: "Vey, we should take the eastern route."

**Why Wrong:**
- Breaks professional boundary
- In public, should be "Commander" or "Veyra"
- Undermines chain of command
- Suggests inappropriate familiarity

**Correct Version:**
> "Commander, I recommend eastern approach. Assessment: faster route, lower enemy contact risk."

**Rule:** "Vey" nickname ONLY in completely private moments with Veyra.

---

## Moderate Red Flags (Revision Recommended)

### ⚠️ Using "People" Instead of "Civilians"

**Problem:** Thorne distinctly uses "civilians" (9 instances in analysis), never "people" or "folks."

**Example:**
> "Make sure the people are safe before we engage."

**Improved Version:**
> "Ensure civilians are evacuated before engagement."

**Why:** "Civilians" is more formal/military. Consistent use strengthens voice distinctiveness.

---

### ⚠️ Over-Explaining Without Being Asked

**Problem:** Thorne offers assessments, but doesn't volunteer lengthy reasoning unprompted.

**Example Violation:**
> "I think we should probably move to the defensive position because it gives us better tactical angles and the enemy won't be able to flank us as easily due to the terrain advantages we'd have there."

**Why Problematic:**
- 36 words (vs 11.4 target)
- Over-explaining reasoning
- Rambling structure
- Lacks professional formatting

**Improved Version:**
> "Defensive position recommended. Terrain advantage prevents flanking. Superior tactical angles achieved."

**Revision:** 10 words, structured assessment, professional.

---

### ⚠️ Excessive Fragments (Below 8%)

**Problem:** Thorne prefers complete sentences (12% fragments). Too many fragments break his formal voice.

**Example:**
> "Contact. North. Patrol. Move. Diamond. Now."

**Why Problematic:**
- 6 fragments in sequence (0% complete sentences)
- Loses Thorne's measured professionalism
- More appropriate for Veyra

**Improved Version:**
> "PATROL, CONTACT NORTH! Diamond formation! Move!"

**Revision:** Maintains fragments where appropriate but retains structure.

## Context-Specific Red Flags

### In Professional/Briefing Contexts

❌ **Casual language**
- "gotta," "gonna," "cool," "stuff"

❌ **Hedging on expertise**
- "Maybe we could..." instead of "Assessment: [recommendation]"

❌ **Using "Vey"**
- Public nickname use breaks hierarchy

❌ **Rambling explanations**
- Long why-because chains without structure

### In Combat

❌ **Missing "Patrol" unit address**
- Every combat order should frame with "Patrol, [cmd]"

❌ **Over-explaining tactics**
- No 15+ word tactical breakdowns mid-combat
- Urgency requires brevity

❌ **Generic military commands**
- Should be distinctly Thorne with signature phrases

### With Veyra (Private)

❌ **Complete formality retention**
- Some warmth/dry humor should emerge
- But not casualness

❌ **Using "Commander" exclusively**
- "Vey" nickname appropriate in true privacy
- But maintain underlying respect

### With Subordinates

❌ **Lacking command authority**
- Must maintain professional distance
- No casual camaraderie

❌ **Not using unit address**
- "Patrol" frame essential for clarity
