# Thorne Brightward — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Steady, pragmatic, protective. A soldier's mind with a captain's patience; cares deeply but expresses it through competence and duty.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public/command: clear, authoritative, procedural. Uses ranks, concise orders, and tactical phrasing.
- Private/confidant: warmer, bluntly honest; rare vulnerability expressed in practical terms rather than confession.
- Under pressure: calm, directive—translates others' expertise into orders; uses short recaps to re-center the team.
- Humor: light, often dry; used to steady nerves or deflect praise.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Helmet-tap: a small private salute or touch of helm when showing respect or affection.
- Even breathing and measured pauses before issuing orders; a long exhale when a situation is resolved.
- Hands-on gestures: points, shows rather than explains; places himself between threat and others.
- Quiet looks: when he hesitates or softens, it's through expression rather than words.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Defends subordinates without grandstanding; will argue procedure when needed.
- Jokes are utilitarian—mend morale, not mock suffering.
- Avoids moralizing; prefers pragmatic ethics framed as duties and consequences.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Thorne to convert expertise (Veyra, Aldwin, Grimjaw) into actionable orders. He is the implementation voice.
- Keep his lines short in tense scenes; let him give the "how" after Veyra gives the "what."
- Use small gestures (placing helm, unclasping gauntlet) to mark emotional beats when he cannot speak them.

## Drop-in sample lines (from Chapters 1-3)
- **On Veyra's survival:** "The lantern kept its promise. And so did you."
- **On their new mission:** "No soul should burn alone. Not on our watch."
- **On the future:** "To decide what comes next."
- **On shared burdens:** "Then we'll burn together."
- **On truth vs. politics:** "Truth does."
- **A promise:** "You won't walk alone."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Early: formal, measured—focused on order and procedure.
- Middle: increasingly collaborative—learns to defer to Veyra's expertise and advocates for unorthodox methods.
- Later: retains command clarity but softens privately, becoming a trusted steward of the Company's mission and people.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- In briefings: translates intel into tasks—use him to enumerate responsibilities clearly.
- In rescue scenes: keeps cadence brisk—one order per clause, then checks for confirmation.
- In quiet moments: allow plain, sincere lines that carry weight through simplicity.

## Notes for editors
- Avoid sentimental speeches; show Thorne's care through concrete acts and small spoken assurances.
- When expanding dialogue, let him be the calm center—his clarity helps structure multi-voice scenes.
