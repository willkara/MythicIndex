# Captain Thorne Brightward - Relationships

## Professional Relationships
- **Veyra Thornwake**: 
  - *Nature of Relationship*: His Commander and sister-in-arms. The other half of the Company's soul.
  - *Hierarchy*: He is her Deputy, and their trust is absolute and unspoken.
  - *Dynamics*: Their bond is the foundational pillar of the Company, forged in tragedy and cemented by unspoken, mutual respect. They are two sides of the same coin. Veyra is the hardened idealist, fully aware she can't save everyone but honor-bound to try. Thorne is the pragmatist who makes her attempts possible. Their disagreements are tactical, never personal, and are born from a deep mutual respect. He knows she's aware of the costs, and his role is to help her mitigate them. Their bond is further deepened by shared strategic planning and mutual support in the face of new threats like the Silent Hand.
  - *History*: The defining moment of his life was finding Veyra in Undershade canyon. He saw in her refusal to leave her fallen comrades a purity of purpose that his years in the city guard had lacked. Standing vigil with her as she buried her friends was a silent oath; he wasn't just joining a cause, he was dedicating his life to a person.
  - *Current Status*: Unshakably loyal. He is her most trusted confidant and tactical sounding board, especially in strategic matters.
  - *Feelings Toward*: Absolute loyalty. He trusts her completely and would follow her into any fire, his only concern being to ensure they have enough buckets of water to get back out.

  - *Hierarchy*: Peers on the command team.
  - *Dynamics*: Like a career general and a career diplomat, Thorne and Marcus share a mutual respect for the necessity of the other's role, even if they don't fully agree with the methods. Thorne sees the world as a series of direct threats requiring tactical solutions, while Marcus sees a web of influence requiring leverage. They are the sword and the shield of the Company's external policy. Their friction is professional, not personal, born from their different but equally valid experiences of the "real world."
  - *History*: They met when Marcus approached Veyra to help form the Company. Thorne was initially wary, but came to respect the undeniable results of Marcus's work in establishing the Bastion.
  - *Current Status*: A functional, respectful, but not warm, working relationship. They are allies, not friends.

He may not like her past, but he cannot deny her skill. He is the one who will formally request her expertise, relying on her analysis of security systems and infiltration routes. This professional respect from a man like Thorne is a new and perhaps unsettling experience for Kaida, forming the basis of a unique, unspoken alliance.
