appearance: "Master Korwin Ironwall is a stocky, broad-shouldered dwarf whose weathered physique reflects a lifetime of heavy craftsmanship. His elderly, heavily lined face is dominated by a massive, wavy white beard that creams slightly near the ends, beneath thick white eyebrows and deep-set, knowing brown eyes that suggest a mischievous professionalism. He is outfitted specifically for his trade in a dark blue woolen tunic with rolled sleeves under a heavy, well-worn brown leather apron, buckled with brass and emblazoned on the chest with a metal shield insignia of a hammer and pickaxe. A matching metal emblem is affixed to the front of his soft brown cap, while a heavy dark hooded cloak drapes over his back. With large, calloused hands, he confidently rests against the tools of his master rank: a heavy wooden-handled sledgehammer planted on the ground and a metal trowel balanced on a cut stone block beside him."
