appearance: "Rill Vossari is a powerful water genasi with an athletic, capable build and a serious, weathered expression that suggests profound experience. Her deep turquoise skin is illuminated from within by swirling, glowing currents of lighter blue arcane energy that seem to flow beneath the surface, concentrating around her face and hands. Her eyes are striking, entirely devoid of pupils and glowing with a flat, pale blue luminosity. Her dark, rope-like dreadlocks are partially pulled back from a shaved side and adorned with copper wire wraps, framing pointed ears pierced with multiple small hoops and studs, alongside a simple nose ring. She is clad in a heavy, dark blue oilskin button-up coat belted at the waist with sturdy brown leather, from which hangs thick coils of rope and a corked glass flask holding glowing blue liquid. Holding a large, dark metal trident in one hand and manifesting swirling magical water in the other, she projects a formidable and elemental presence."
