## Rituals of Respect

Rill's daily practice involves constant small gestures of acknowledgment toward both Istishia and the waters she works with. Before any significant water-working, she dips her spear-tip and whispers the names carved on its shaft—a roll call of successful partnerships, followed by the formal Temple invocation: "By the grace of the Ever-Changing, may this water remember joy."

She tests ropes not with sharp tugs but with hummed notes—hymns from the Temple's tidal liturgy that resonate at frequencies water finds pleasing. After every successful rescue or intervention, she performs the Returning: wringing her coat hem and pouring a palmful of water back into itself while speaking the ritual words, "What was borrowed is returned, what was changed remains changed, blessed be the cycle."

When working with victims of cold water immersion, she has an unusual technique taught by the Temple elders: she talks to them about water in all its forms. Not just warmth, but transformation—how this same water was once cloud, once rain on summer stones, once steam rising from hot springs. She speaks to both the victim and the water clinging to them, reminding both that cold is temporary, that Istishia's nature is change, and change means this too shall pass.

Her morning ritual involves reading the water before reading anything else—a cup poured at dawn, observed as it settles, the patterns in its surface speaking of the day's mood. The Temple teaches that Istishia speaks most clearly in these liminal moments, when night becomes day, when stillness becomes motion.
