appearance: "Elara Whisperwind is an elven rogue with a lithe, agile build, instantly recognizable by the long, pointed ears emerging from the shadows of her hood. She possesses a pale complexion and an intense, focused gaze emanating from dark eyes, while wavy dark brown hair cascades loosely over her shoulders. She is outfitted for stealth in a heavy, dark blue-grey woolen cloak that partially covers her segmented dark leather armor, including a visible cuirass on her torso and sturdy gauntlets on her forearms. Tall, worn brown leather boots complete her practical gear, suited for navigating treacherous dungeons. In this portrait, she is captured mid-motion in a shadowy ruin, reaching cautiously toward a stone structure while avoiding a vicious, clawed metal trap set upon the ground near her feet."
