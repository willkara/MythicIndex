# Elara Whisperwind - Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: An elven community, likely one with a strong tradition of divination and mysticism.
- **Social Class**: Unknown.
- **Cultural Background**: Elven, with a personal inclination towards quiet observation and subtle arts.

## History
- **Professional Career**: The infiltrator and trap specialist for the Gilded Compass. Her skills in stealth and her keen senses made her an invaluable asset for navigating dangerous ruins and hostile territory.

## Personal Details
- **A Secret Talent**: Elara was a gifted tea-leaf reader. It was a skill she learned from her grandmother, and while she presented it as a bit of a party trick, she had a genuine, uncanny knack for seeing patterns and potential futures in the leaves. Her quiet pronouncements, often delivered with a wry smile, were a source of both comfort and gentle guidance for the party.
- **How She Relaxed**: She found peace in rooftop gardens and high, quiet places. She would often slip away from the noise of the city to sit on a high ledge or in a hidden garden, simply watching the world go by from a distance. It was in these moments of quiet observation that she felt most at ease.
- **Favorite Meal**: Spiced Lentil Soup with warm, crusty bread. It was a simple, quiet meal that she could eat slowly. She had incredibly sensitive hearing, and the loud, boisterous atmosphere of most taverns was often overwhelming for her. This was a meal she could enjoy in a quiet corner, a small island of peace in a noisy world.
- **Favorite Drink**: Whisper-leaf chamomile brewed with a slice of candied ginger. She strains it through a silk cloth and reads the remaining leaves in solitude before choosing her path for the night.
