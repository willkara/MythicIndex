appearance: "Venn is a mature Wood Elf with a sturdy, capable build and a weathered, ruddy complexion that bears the marks of an experienced outdoorswoman. Her dark brown hair is swept back tightly from her face, gathered into a thick, intricate braid pulled over her right shoulder which is secured by a distinctive tarnished silver clasp. Deep laugh lines frame her dark eyes and broad nose, emphasizing a wide, confident, and slightly smug grin that seems fixed on her face. She is encased in functional, heavy plate armor with a worn, oiled bronze finish, strapped over dark leather underlayers. In her left hand, she firmly grips a dark wood recurve bow, while a leather quiver packed with fletched arrows rises behind her right shoulder, completing the look of a battle-ready city guard archer."
