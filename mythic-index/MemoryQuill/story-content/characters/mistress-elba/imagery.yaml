appearance: "Mistress Elba is a sturdy, broad-shouldered dwarven matron whose weathered face is deeply lined with age and holds a stern, no-nonsense expression. Her thick hair is a distinct blend of iron-gray and residual copper streaks, pulled back into an intricate traditional braid that rests on her shoulder. Intense, deep amber eyes stare out sharply from beneath heavy, shadowed brows, observing everything with a critical gaze. She is clad in a dark, practical work dress with rolled-up sleeves underneath a thick, well-worn leather apron heavily stained with the grime of countless meals. A small hoop earring is visible in her left ear, and her formidable forearms suggest the strength of a lifetime of labor. Standing with hands planted firmly on her hips amidst a rustic kitchen filled with vegetables and copper pots, she projects an undeniable aura of fierce, maternal authority that demands respect."
