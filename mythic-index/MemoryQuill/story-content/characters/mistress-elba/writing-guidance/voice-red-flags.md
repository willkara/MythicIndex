# Mistress Elba - Voice Red Flags

---

## Critical Red Flags

### ❌ Asking Permission to Command

**Problem:** Elba commands with authority, not permission.

**Violation:** "Would you mind..." or "Perhaps you could..."

**Correct:** "My boys, you sit and eat. Now."

---

### ❌ Formal Speech

**Problem:** Elba is warm, maternal, not formal.

**Violation:** "I respectfully suggest..." or overly formal phrasing

**Correct:** "Eat this. You need it."

---

### ❌ Missing Food References

**Problem:** Food is central to Elba's character (60%+ references).

**Violation:** Extended Elba dialogue with zero food mention.

**Correction:** Include food naturally in context.

---

### ❌ Missing "My Boys/Girls"

**Problem:** Possessive signature should appear frequently (8 instances).

**Violation:** Addressing company members without "my boys/girls."

**Correction:** "My boys, you're not going anywhere without..."

---

## Moderate Red Flags

### ⚠️ Over 15 Words/Line

**Problem:** Elba is 11.6 avg - warm but not verbose.

**Violation:** 18+ word sentences.

**Correction:** Keep maternal and direct.

---

### ⚠️ Missing Dwarven Markers

**Problem:** Elba uses "By stone and steel!" and dwarven authority.

**Violation:** No dwarven language or cultural markers.

---

### ⚠️ Overly Gentle or Weak

**Problem:** Elba commands with authority beneath affection.

**Violation:** Timid or apologetic tone.

**Correct:** "My boys, this is non-negotiable. Eat."
