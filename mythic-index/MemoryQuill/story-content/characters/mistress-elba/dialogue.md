## Dialogue Examples
### Casual Conversation
"Well then, child, you look like you haven't eaten in a week - just like my grandson Dain when he gets too busy with his studies. Sit yourself down and I'll fix you something proper. Don't argue with me - I can see those hollow cheeks from here, and I've fed seven grandchildren who tried the same excuses."

### Under Pressure
"No, no, NO! You don't season the meat AFTER it's cooked, you daft boy! Stone's teeth, I taught my little Thorek this when he was barely knee-high to a grasshopper. By my grandmother's rolling pin, how do you expect to feed anyone properly if you can't follow simple instructions?"

### Emotional Moment
"Listen here, lad. You saved that girl's life today, and don't think I didn't notice. Reminds me of my Borin - always putting others first. You all come back here bruised and bleeding, thinking you're so tough... but I see. I always see - raised three children and seven grandchildren, and a grandmother always knows. Now eat your stew before it gets cold, or I'll be writing to your mother about your poor eating habits."
