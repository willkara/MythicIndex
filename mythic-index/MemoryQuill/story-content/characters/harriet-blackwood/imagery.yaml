appearance: "Harriet Blackwood is a stout, sturdy human woman in her late forties with a powerfully warm, open-armed presence. Her dark brown hair, heavily streaked with grey at the temples and hairline, is pulled back loosely from a ruddy, weathered face marked by deep smile lines and prominent crow's feet. Her warm, dark brown eyes crinkle with a welcoming expression above a prominent nose and a wide, open-mouthed smile showing her teeth. She wears a practical dark brown work dress with the sleeves pushed up, covered almost entirely by a large, textured beige canvas apron with deep pockets that is visibly stained and worn from constant use. Her large, work-roughened hands are held wide in an inviting gesture, and sturdy dark leather shoes are visible beneath the long hem of her dress. The overall impression is one of overwhelming maternal authority and bustling, practical efficiency, ready to take charge and care for anyone in her vicinity."
