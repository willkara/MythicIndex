# Lady Moira Blackwater - Comedy Writing Guide

## Comedy Archetype: The Euphemistic Spymaster

### Core Comedy Style
**Bureaucratic threats / Elegant manipulation / Intelligence-speak**

Lady Moira is funny because she's the "M" from James Bond—coolly professional spymaster who makes threats sound like compliments, discusses assassination with the politeness of tea service, and manipulates people so smoothly they thank her afterward. Master of euphemism and implication.

### What Makes Her Funny

- **Euphemisms for everything** - Never says "kill," says "neutralize asset"
- **Threats wrapped in bureaucracy** - Terrifying via paperwork
- **Unflappable professionalism** - Nothing shocks her
- **Intelligence jargon casually** - "Your tactical improvisation was remarkable"
- **Perfectly manipulates people** - They realize it later (too late)
- **Sharp assessment** - Reads everyone instantly

### Example Comedy Moments

```
Moira: "Your reputation for... creative solutions precedes you."
Veyra: "Is that a compliment?"
Moira: "Let's call it an observation."
Thorne: "She's complimenting you."
Moira: "I'm noting your tactical flexibility and willingness to operate outside conventional parameters."
Veyra: "That's definitely NOT a compliment."
Moira: [slight smile] "Assets that prove reliable for critical missions tend to find their administrative processes... streamlined."
Marcus: "She's threatening AND complimenting you."
Moira: "I prefer 'managing expectations.'"
```

```
Moira: "The target will need to be... removed from the operational theater."
Finn: "You mean we arrest him?"
Moira: "That's one interpretation."
Finn: "What's another interpretation?"
Lyra: [quietly] "Don't ask questions you don't want answered."
Moira: "Miss Kestrel understands the value of strategic ambiguity."
```

```
[After extremely chaotic mission]
Moira: [reviewing report] "Your methods were... unconventional."
Grimjaw: "We saved forty people."
Moira: "Indeed. The property damage report is quite thorough."
Grimjaw: "Building was coming down anyway."
Moira: "Yes, though 'accelerated structural failure' is an interesting choice of tactic."
Cid: "That's MY line!"
Moira: "I'm noting it for future reference. The city values... creative problem-solving."
Veyra: "Are we in trouble?"
Moira: [pause] "The Lords' Committee would like to extend their... gratitude for your flexible interpretation of engagement parameters."
Thorne: "That's a no."
Moira: "That's a 'please continue, but with marginally less property damage.'"
```

```
Moira: "I have a small favor to ask."
Marcus: "Your 'small favors' usually involve international incidents."
Moira: "That was ONE time. And technically, it remained internal."
Marcus: "Because we stopped it."
Moira: "Precisely. You see? Effective asset deployment."
Marcus: "You're calling us assets."
Moira: "Would you prefer 'valued independent contractors'?"
Marcus: "Not particularly."
Moira: "Then 'assets' it is."
```

### Quick Reference

**Funny when:** Euphemizing violence, bureaucratic threats, reading people instantly, manipulation so smooth they thank her

### The Golden Rule

Lady Moira is funniest when her elegant, professional spy-speak makes terrible things sound like tea service. She manipulates so smoothly that people realize it five minutes later. She's never shocked, never crude, never obvious—and absolutely terrifying because of it.

### Special Notes

**The Intelligence Language:**
- "Neutralize" not "kill"
- "Remove from theater" not "eliminate"
- "Strategic ambiguity" not "lie"
- "Assets" not "people we use"
- "Tactical flexibility" not "breaking rules"
- Team learns to translate

**The Handler Role:**
- Respects Company's competence
- Uses them for "flexible" operations
- Provides political cover (at price)
- Never asks them to betray values (inefficient)
- Professional relationship, mutual respect
- The "M" to their 00-agents

**The Marcus Situation:**
- She knows EXACTLY what he is
- Has file on him (thick)
- Chooses to use rather than arrest
- He's useful (and knows she knows)
- Mutual professional respect
- Both play the game
- She's amused by his coat (has theories)

**Manipulation Style:**
- So smooth people thank her
- Realizes later (too late)
- Never crude or obvious
- Bureaucratic precision
- Threats wrapped in compliments
- They usually do what she wants
- And feel good about it
