appearance: "Lady Moira Blackwater is a half-elf whose stern countenance and prominent pointed ears betray a lifetime of serious command. Appearing to be in her late forties or fifties, her face is marked with deep lines of experience, framing intense, very dark eyes that hold a direct, unwavering gaze beneath furrowed brows. Her hair is a practical mix of iron-gray and silver, pulled tightly back from her face in a severe, no-nonsense style. She wears functional, understated attire consisting of a heavy, well-worn dark brown jacket over a dark collared shirt, cinched at the waist with a plain leather belt. Her hands, veiny and weathered from years of active service, rest flat upon a desk covered in strategic maps and a heavy, wax-sealed ledger. Overall, she projects an intimidating aura of pragmatic authority and calculated intelligence."
