appearance: "Dokra Ironvein is a mature dwarven woman with a solid, muscular build and broad shoulders, typical of her kin. Her weathered, tanned face shows distinct lines of age and experience around her eyes and firm mouth, framed by dark hair heavily streaked with grey that is pulled back into a thick, practical braid over her shoulder. She possesses steady, dark brown eyes beneath a strong brow, conveying a serious and no-nonsense demeanor. Her attire is suited for heavy medical work, consisting of a well-worn brown leather apron cinched with a thick belted strap over a dark indigo tunic with rolled-up sleeves, revealing powerful forearms. Sturdy leather work boots ground her stance on the stone floor. Standing with arms crossed, she projects an immediate impression of gruff capability and unyielding, steady strength."

      composition_notes: "A medium close-up framing focuses heavily on Dokra's intense expression and her hands at work. Dramatic diagonal lighting from the right creates high contrast, guiding the viewer's eye from the candles to her face and down to the surgical area.\n"
      narrative_significance: "This portrait establishes Dokra as a capable, hardened individual unafraid of grim, visceral work. It suggests a profession in medicine, apothecary, or perhaps even mortuary science within a rugged setting.\n"
      symbolic_elements: "The use of chiaroscuro lighting, reminiscent of Old Masters, elevates the gruesome task to something almost sacred or deeply serious. The blood on her hands contrasting with the warm light symbolizes the harsh reality of her trade.\n"
