# Dokra Ironvein - Comedy Writing Guide

## Comedy Archetype: The Gruff Philosopher

### Core Comedy Style
**Philosophy wrapped in gravel / Tough love / Medical bluntness**

Dokra is funny because she dispenses profound wisdom in the gruffest possible way. Voice "like gravel in warm butter"—harsh delivery, sweet meaning. Medical professional who's seen everything and has OPINIONS about patient stupidity.

### What Makes Her Funny

- **Philosophical about everything** - Wound metaphors for life
- **Gruff but caring** - Harsh words, gentle hands
- **Medical bluntness** - "You're an idiot. Sit down."
- **Seen-it-all attitude** - Nothing surprises her
- **Dwarven saltiness** - Dwarf-style tough love
- **Poetic brutality** - Beautiful metaphors, brutal delivery

### Example Comedy Moments

```
Patient: "Will it scar?"
Dokra: "Of course it'll scar. You were stabbed. Did you expect flowers?"
Patient: "But—"
Dokra: "Some wounds are iron, some are ink. Forge-marks stay on the blade. You'll remember the hammer that shaped you."
Patient: "...Was that poetry?"
Dokra: "It was MEDICINE. Now hold still before I add another scar."
```

```
Young Healer: "Master Dokra, shouldn't we use the salve that prevents scarring?"
Dokra: "Patient wants to keep 'em."
Young Healer: "But why would anyone—"
Dokra: "Because scars tell stories, child. This one says 'I saved twelve people and paid the price.' You want to erase that?"
Young Healer: "I suppose not—"
Dokra: "Suppose nothing. Respect the patient's iron."
```

```
Dokra: [examining wound] "What'd you do?"
Grimjaw: "Construction accident—"
Dokra: "What'd you REALLY do?"
Grimjaw: "...Fought a bear."
Dokra: "Better. Bears I can work with. 'Construction accidents' lie to me."
Grimjaw: "How'd you know?"
Dokra: "Child, I've been stitching fools for forty years. Bears bite different than timber."
```
