# Dokra Ironvein - Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: A dwarven stronghold, likely Mirabar or a similar settlement known for its craftwork.
- **Social Class**: Respected artisan and professional class.
- **Cultural Background**: Traditional dwarven, with a strong emphasis on the value of craft, resilience, and pragmatism.

## History
- **Professional Career**: A highly experienced trauma surgeon at Brightstone Healers' Hall in Waterdeep. Her reputation is built on decades of practical, no-nonsense healing in one of the city's busiest wards.
- **Medical Philosophy**: She believes that scars, both physical and emotional, are not flaws to be erased, but marks of a survivor that tell a story. Her philosophy is encapsulated in her saying: "Some wounds are iron, some are ink. Forge-marks stay on the blade to remember the hammer that shaped it."

## Personal Details
- **How She Relaxes**: She is a master jeweler and gem-cutter. After a long day of the messy, imprecise work of healing flesh and bone, she finds a deep sense of peace in the clean, mathematical precision of faceting a gemstone. The absolute control and the creation of perfect, beautiful angles from a rough stone is the ultimate antidote to the chaos of the trauma ward.
- **Favorite Meal**: A simple, potent meal of blood sausage, sharp cheese, and a dark, bitter stout. It's a no-nonsense, iron-rich meal that she claims "keeps the blood strong." It's the kind of practical, fortifying food a busy surgeon with no time for frivolity would eat.
- **Favorite Drink**: A steaming mug of stonebrew kav, a dwarven chicory coffee cut with a ribbon of smoked honey. She savors it between shifts, letting the bite and burn clear her head before she steps back into the ward.
- **A Secret Soft Spot**: She has a hidden collection of miniature silver animal figurines. Each one was a gift from a former patient, usually a child, who she treated. She keeps them in a locked box in her quarters and, in her private moments, will take them out and polish them, each one a silent reminder of a life she saved.
