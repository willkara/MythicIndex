# Corporal Darric – Character Development

## Personality Core
- **Defining Traits**: Reliable, steady, unimpressed, dry sense of humor, deeply loyal to her unit.
- **Core Values**: Clan honor, tradition, duty, the importance of holding your ground.
- **Motivations**: To live up to her family name and to protect the comrades who have become her second family.
- **Fears**: Bringing dishonor to her clan, letting her team down in a critical moment.
- **Internal Conflicts**: The dwarven love of tradition versus the unprecedented, unconventional nature of the Last Light Company's mission.

## Character Arc
- **Starting Point**: A dependable, if somewhat cynical, Corporal in the City Watch, content with her role.
- **Catalyst Events**: Witnessing Veyra's dwarven-like grit and resilience in the face of unimaginable trauma.
- **Current State**: A steadfast member of the Company, providing a grounding, no-nonsense presence that balances the more eccentric specialists.
- **Intended Destination**: To become a respected veteran within the Company, a touchstone of common sense and reliability for the entire team.

## Key Relationships
- **Relationship to Thorne**: Thorne is "The Captain." She respects the rank and the man holding it. She trusts his judgment implicitly because he has never led them astray. She wouldn't call him a friend, but she'd die for him without hesitation.
- **Reaction to Veyra**:
    - **First Thought**: "Gods, look at her. She's got the grit of a quarry-master. Most would be screaming or catatonic. She's... working." Her initial thought is one of professional, almost grudging, respect for Veyra's sheer fortitude, recognizing a shared dwarven value of endurance over emotional display.
    - **Why She Followed**: Loyalty to her unit was the start. The turning point for her was Veyra's quiet, fierce dignity during her recovery. She wasn't broken, she was reforged. Her jest about "dwarven oil" was her way of acknowledging her incredible resilience, a quality highly prized in dwarven culture. She saw that this new path, while uncertain, had more substance and meaning than endless city patrols.
