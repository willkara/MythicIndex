appearance: "Corporal Darric is a formidable female Shield Dwarf with a stout, powerful build and broad shoulders. Her weathered face, marked by deep lines and wrinkles, is set in a perpetually stern, almost scowling expression that suggests years of demanding service. Her dark, grayish-brown hair is pulled back into thick, practical braids that frame her ruddy complexion and intense, dark eyes deeply set beneath heavy brows. She is clad in worn, robust dark metal plate armor with a dull bronze patina, secured by functional brown leather straps across her chest and featuring a faint star emblem. A heavy, round metal shield rests against her left side, ready for instant use. Her large, capable hands resting on her armored leg convey a sense of grounded reliability and combat readiness."
