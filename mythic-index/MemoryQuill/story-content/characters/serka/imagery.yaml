appearance: "Serka is an imposing female orc in her 30s, possessing a heavily muscular frame honed by years as a veteran warrior. Her face, marked visibly by the scars of past conflicts, is dominated by eyes that perpetually hold a look of murderous cruelty. She carries herself with an aggressive, confident posture that broadcasts her brutish nature to anyone nearby. Attired in the practical, rugged mercenary gear typical of the Black Hawks elite, she looks every bit a vicious combatant ready for violence. She is rarely seen without her signature twin fighting axes at her sides, weapons she wields with deadly expertise."
