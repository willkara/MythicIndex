appearance: "Silvan Oakshield is an ancient elf whose deeply lined and weathered face is framed by a cascade of long, flowing white hair and a full beard streaked with silver. His prominent, pointed ears are striking against his pale, aged skin, while his deep-set eyes hold a stern, intense gaze beneath heavy brows. He is enveloped in a thick, textured cloak of dark forest green that appears almost organic, resembling moss and bark with tattered, uneven edges. In his gnarled hands, he firmly grasps a tall, twisted wooden staff that is alive with vibrant green leaves and winding vines. A simple, worn leather pouch hangs at his waist, blending into the rough layers of his earthy attire. His overall presence projects an imposing aura of natural wisdom and rooted authority."
