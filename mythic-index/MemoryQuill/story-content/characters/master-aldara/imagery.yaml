appearance: "Master Aldara Greenthumb is an elderly halfling woman with a sturdy build and a face deeply etched with wrinkles and weathered skin from years of demanding work. Her intense, shadowed dark eyes gaze sternly from beneath the heavy folds of a textured dark brown woollen hood that partially obscures her greying dark hair. She possesses a prominent, somewhat bulbous nose and a determined set to her jaw, often seen gesturing authoritatively with her large, capable hands. Her practical attire consists of a quilted, dark teal under-tunic laced at the throat beneath her rough cloak, cinched by a wide leather belt featuring a large, square brass buckle. A substantial leather satchel is strapped to her hip, ever-present in the dimly lit field hospital environments she oversees. Despite her small stature, Aldara projects an undeniable aura of professional command and no-nonsense competence."
