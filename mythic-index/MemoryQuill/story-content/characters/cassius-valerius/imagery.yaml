appearance: "Master Cassius Valerius is a lean human male who appears to be in his late twenties or early thirties, possessing a serious, composed demeanor. He has thick, wavy dark brown hair that is slightly tousled, framing a face with a fair complexion, a strong jawline, and a faint shadow of stubble. His dark brown eyes hold an intense, steady gaze beneath pronounced eyebrows. Cassius is dressed in heavy, layered scholar's robes, wearing a textured charcoal grey woolen cloak with a hood pushed back over a warm rust-brown tunic, cinched at the waist by a dark leather belt with a brass buckle. He stands firmly in his library setting, holding a rolled parchment scroll in his right hand while his left rests upon a stack of large, leather-bound books on a side table. The overall impression he projects is one of quiet determination and deep intellectual focus."
