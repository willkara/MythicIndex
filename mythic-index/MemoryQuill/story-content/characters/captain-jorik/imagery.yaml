appearance: "Captain Jorik is a human male possessing the robust, broad-shouldered build befitting a \"grizzled veteran\" with decades of service. His face is deeply weathered and lined with heavy wrinkles around his eyes and forehead, betraying his advanced age and arduous life. He has thick, swept-back silver-gray hair and a dense, full beard and mustache of the same color. His dark, heavy-lidded eyes hold a weary but intense gaze, set within a tanned, leathery complexion that bears the marks of battle, most notably a prominent diagonal scar cutting across his right cheek. He is encased in functional, battle-worn steel plate armor secured by thick brown leather straps and brass buckles, with the dark, leather-wrapped hilt of a sword visible at his left shoulder. Jorik projects an air of stoic, experienced professionalism and the hardened resolve of a career soldier who commands respect."
