# Zephyr Song – Dialogue & Mannerisms

## Speech Patterns

- Vocabulary Level: Educated but practical; mixes courier slang with occasional philosophical observations
- Accent/Dialect: Slight purring roll on R's when excited, words blend together when thinking fast
- Formal/Informal: Informal by default; enters conversations sideways, interrupts with precision rather than rudeness, and has a talent for changing subjects by making connections others miss. She punctuates serious moments with unexpected levity and treats humor as another tool for redirecting momentum.
- Unique Phrases: "Edges are invitations," "The city's singing today," "Every corner is a door," "Time to dance with stone," "The road knows"
- Verbal Tics: Finishes others' sentences, answers questions before they're complete, speaks in run-on streams when excited or clipped fragments when focused

## Common Expressions

- Greetings: "Already running late!", "The wind brought me", "Perfect timing—as always", "You needed something? (before being asked)"
- Farewells: "The road calls", "Until the next sunrise", "I'll be there before you miss me", "Keep your feet light"
- Exclamations: "By the Couatl's scales!", "Dawn take it!", "Feathers and fortune!", "Sweet sunrise!"
- Curses/Oaths: "Broken wings", "Mud and molasses", "Stuck in tar", "Heavy as stone"

## Physical Mannerisms

- Nervous Habits: Traces route patterns on surfaces with one claw, ears flick independently scanning for exits, shifts weight foot to foot in a runner's rhythm
- Happy Gestures: Tail makes figure-eights, produces a sub-vocal purr that harmonizes with ambient sounds, bounces on her toe-pads
- Angry Reactions: Goes completely still (unnatural for her), tail tip twitches exactly once per second, claws extend just slightly
- Thinking Poses: Head tilts as if listening to something others can't hear, eyes unfocus while tracking invisible possibilities, one ear forward one back
- Social Behaviors: When forced to be still—during planning sessions, formal dinners, or standing watch—her tail betrays her inner restlessness, the tip counting heartbeats like a metronome. Those who know her well can gauge the urgency of a situation by the tempo of that unconscious motion.

## Daily Rituals & Habits

Every dawn, regardless of where she's slept (or if she's slept), Zephyr performs the same ritual. She draws Windcatch, runs the blade along the thumb ring until it sings a clear note, tests the quick-release mechanism twice, then kisses her left palm before touching stone, wood, and metal in sequence—asking the city's permission to dance through its spaces. During this ritual, she often experiences the strongest temporal awareness, sometimes glimpsing the day's critical moments in advance.

She maintains her equipment with religious dedication. After each use, Windcatch gets wiped with lamp oil while she whispers "Thank you for holding" to the blade. Her micro-line gets inspected for frays every evening, and she re-coils it using a pattern that lets her deploy exact lengths by feel alone.

## Conversational Habits

### Speaking Style Examples

**When Excited:** "Oh—oh you haven't heard? The bridge is out—well, will be out, construction starts tomorrow but everyone's routing through Market Street already because they know—or think they know—and the crowds are just impossible so I've been taking the Widow's Walk, you know the one with the thirteen chimneys? Only it's twelve now because—"

**When Focused:** "Left wall. Lamp post. Your awning. Move. Now."

**When Philosophical:** "Time isn't a river, it's more like... rainfall. All the drops falling at once, but we can only feel them one at a time. Unless you learn to dance between them."

**When Suspicious:** "That's interesting—you asked about the east route before I mentioned I took it. Planning something, or just good at reading patterns?"

### Temporal Awareness in Speech

Her accelerated mental processing manifests in conversation:
- Responds to the question someone is about to ask rather than what they just said
- Provides information before being asked for it
- Sometimes continues conversations from where they'll end up, not where they are
- Occasionally slips and mentions things that haven't happened yet, then has to backtrack

**Example Exchange:**
- Other: "I was wondering if you could—"
- Zephyr: "Tuesday, before noon, back entrance, wrapped in oilcloth to protect from the rain."
- Other: "...deliver this package. Wait, what rain?"
- Zephyr: "The rain that—never mind. Tuesday work for you?"

## Emotional Responses

- Under Stress: Words accelerate until she's speaking almost too fast to follow, tail coils tighter with each breath, starts narrating escape routes aloud
- When Lying: Can't—not won't, but literally cannot lie effectively. Her temporal awareness makes her stumble over false futures, and her tail goes completely rigid
- When Comfortable: Adds unnecessary flourishes to movement, plays with light and shadow, speaks in longer flowing sentences with poetic observations
- In Conflict: Becomes playfully mocking, uses opponent's words against them, narrates their movements before they make them (deeply unnerving)
