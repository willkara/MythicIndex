# Zephyr Song – Relationships

## Family Bonds

- Wind-Through-Rushes (father, deceased): Taught her to read the road's rhythm. She carries his route-marking chalk and still uses his shorthand for danger signs.
- Pearl-at-Dawn (mother, deceased): Source of her kindness and her name. Zephyr unconsciously mimics her mother's head-tilt when listening carefully.
- Swift-Current (younger brother, presumed dead): She refuses to believe he died in the massacre. Sometimes glimpses a tabaxi assassin in temporal shadows who moves like family.
- Tamsin Quickfoot (surrogate mother): Human woman, 67, who runs the Messenger's Guild. Treats Zephyr as the daughter she never had, worries about her transformation.

## Romantic Relationships

- Marcus Goldhand (mutual attraction, unconsummated): A merchant's son who appreciates her stillness as much as her speed. He gifts her interesting feathers he finds, not knowing their significance. She slows down around him—literally—and he's one of the few who can make her sit still for an entire meal.

## Friendships

- Three-Bells Jake (close friend): A human courier who works the night routes. They have an ongoing competition about who knows more secret paths through the city. He's noticed she's changing but hasn't asked questions.
- Whisper (trusted friend): A kenku messenger who speaks only in echoes of things they've heard. Somehow, Whisper's repetitions of future conversations don't surprise Zephyr anymore.
- Bright-Penny (childhood friend): A halfling who runs a tea shop that stays open all night for couriers. Knows Zephyr's real story and keeps her secrets.

## Professional Relationships

- Messenger's Guild: She's earned unusual respect from the Messenger's Guild despite technically operating outside their structure. The Guild's official stance is that she's a "consulting specialist," hired for packages that absolutely must arrive regardless of conditions.
- Lamplighters: Know her by the particular whistle that echoes off their ladder rungs. They've started leaving their ladders in specific positions when they know she's running night routes.
- Roof-runners: Recognize her signature—a small chalk mark that looks like a falling feather, indicating a route she's tested and found solid. There's an unspoken agreement: they don't use her routes during dawn hours.
- Kaida Shadowstep: A professional client who uses Zephyr for discreet delivery of "acquired packages." Their relationship is built on mutual respect and careful boundaries—neither asks questions they don't want answered.
- Brother Aldric (Temple of Lathander): A dawn priest who first noticed the celestial feathers. Provides spiritual guidance and suspects her connection to something divine. He's been documenting the feathers' appearances.
- The Dusk Runners: A loose collective of twilight couriers who've noticed similar blessed individuals. They meet monthly at sunset to share information about "the changing ones."

## Adversaries

- The Wheelwright (hidden nemesis): The crime lord who killed her parents, now running Waterdeep's underground. Wears her parents' claws as trophies. She knows who he is; he doesn't know she exists—yet.
- Rust (professional rival): A tabaxi courier who believes Zephyr's supernatural abilities are "cheating" and undermine honest runners. Actively tries to beat her to deliveries and spreads rumors about her being "touched."
- Magister Thrace (suspicious authority): A city official who's noticed the pattern of Zephyr arriving just before crimes are prevented. Suspects she's involved somehow and has started tracking her routes.
- The Shadowclock Guild (territorial conflict): A thieves' guild that objects to her using "their" rooftop highways without paying dues. They've set traps that she seems to mysteriously avoid.
