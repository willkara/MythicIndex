## History

### Childhood

Born on the move between cities, Zephyr's earliest memories are the sway of wagon wheels and her mother's voice teaching her the names of stars from the caravan's roof. Her parents were respected guides who knew every hidden water source, bandit ambush point, and safe harbor between Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep. They named her for the gentle morning wind that blessed her birth—a good omen, they said, for one born to the road.

Even as a kit, she displayed unusual temporal sensitivity. She'd wake moments before night attacks, find lost items by "remembering where they would be," and always knew when weather would turn. Her parents thought it clever intuition, the road's gift to those born upon it. Her father taught her to climb before she could properly walk, her mother showed her how to read the micro-expressions of horses and oxen that warned of danger ahead.

### Education & Training

After her parents' death when she was twelve, the Waterdeep Messenger's Guild took her in—not from charity, but because Tamsin Quickfoot, the guild's matron, recognized her potential. The guild became her school: older couriers taught her the city's vertical highways, how to read the flow of crowds, the art of memory palaces for message retention.

Her fighting style emerged from necessity and play. Urban architecture became an extended weapon system—doorframes as pivot points, hanging shop signs as pendulum anchors, even an opponent's own equipment as leverage. She developed techniques that blend acrobatics with tactical disruption: The Hitch-Step (using someone's belt to redirect their momentum), Lantern Snare (tangling pursuers in their own cloaks), and Belt-Frog Borrow (redistributing an opponent's carried weight mid-combat).

But beneath the acrobatic prowess was always that temporal gift—she moved not just through space but through possibility, unconsciously choosing the path that would arrive at the perfect moment.

### Formative Events

**The Caravan Massacre (Age 12)**: Her parents' caravan was ambushed by the Crimson Wheel bandits near Dragonspear Castle. She survived by hiding in a hidden compartment her father had shown her, emerging hours later to find everyone dead. The bandit leader, a man with a scarred throat who wore a necklace of tabaxi claws, would later become the crime lord known as "The Wheelwright" in Waterdeep's underground.

**First Impossible Delivery (Age 16)**: Tasked with delivering a healing potion across the city during a riot, she discovered she could run on walls for extended periods. The delivery took seven minutes through a route deemed impossible. The child lived. This was when she earned the nickname "Flashstep."

**The Dawn Bargain (Age 17)**: [Expanded below]

### Major Life Events

- Age 19: First courier job for someone she suspected was involved in illegal activities (proved correct)
- Age 20: Discovered one of the Wheelwright's lieutenants; chose to gather information rather than seek revenge
- Age 21: Began experiencing "temporal shadows"—glimpses of immediate future possibilities
- Age 22: First feather manifestation after saving a drowning child
- Age 23: Met Kaida Shadowstep; began occasional "special deliveries"
- Age 24: Current; the Couatl's gift growing stronger and stranger

## The Dawn Bargain

The bridge collapse wasn't random—the Couatl had been watching her for years.

At seventeen, Zephyr was running a routine delivery across the Grimwald Bridge when she felt it: a wrongness in the rhythm of stone and wood, a discordance in time itself. The supports gave way beneath her feet, but she'd already begun moving, her temporal sensitivity screaming warnings. As civilians plummeted around her, time seemed to crystallize. Between one heartbeat and the next, a presence filled the air—radiant, feathered, impossibly vast for the space it occupied.

The Couatl materialized from morning light itself, scales shimmering with dawn colors that had no names. Its wings spread to catch the falling, but its ancient eyes fixed on Zephyr alone. In that suspended instant, it spoke without words, directly into her mind: 

*I have watched you dance along time's edge since birth. You feel the rhythm others cannot hear. The road taught you to read possibility, but I offer you mastery. Become my wings in the waking world. Carry the dawn's promise to those who need it most. Be the arrival that changes endings.*

The agreement formed faster than thought—or perhaps it had always existed, waiting for this moment. The Couatl's power flooded through her, permanent as a scar, gentle as morning. She saved them all that day—not by moving between heartbeats, but by being exactly where each person needed her to be, exactly when they needed her. She caught hands, redirected falls, created chains of salvation where each rescued person could save another. 

The Couatl vanished with the last rescue, but its gift remained: her temporal sensitivity evolved into true temporal awareness.

## The Courier's Resonance

The Couatl didn't give Zephyr a mission or prophecy—it enhanced what was already there. Her gift manifests as supernatural intuition:

- **Moment Recognition**: She experiences sudden clarity about when things need to happen. A tingling at the base of her skull warns when someone nearby will need help. Her feet carry her toward problems she doesn't consciously know exist yet.

- **Route Prescience**: What feels like professional courier instinct is actually temporal awareness. She chooses the "inefficient" alley that avoids the accident that hasn't happened yet, arrives at addresses moments before emergencies, finds herself inexplicably delaying or rushing deliveries for reasons that only become clear later.

- **Temporal Rhythm**: She unconsciously speeds up or slows down to arrive at exactly the right moment. Others think she's lucky; she's actually surfing probability waves she can feel but not fully understand.

The gift is evolving. Lately, when moving at peak speed, she glimpses "temporal shadows"—ghost images of herself taking different routes, phantoms of what might happen if she chooses differently. She's beginning to suspect the Couatl didn't just enhance her speed, but partially unmoored her from linear time.

## Dealings with Kaida Shadowstep

Zephyr's reputation for speed and discretion has brought her into the orbit of many of the city's influential and clandestine figures, none more intriguing than Kaida Shadowstep. Theirs is a strictly professional relationship, built on a foundation of mutual respect for each other's skills. Kaida, a woman who moves through the city's hidden pathways, occasionally requires a package to move even faster and more elusively than she can. For these "acquisitions," she turns to Zephyr.

The arrangements are always the same: a dead drop, a pre-paid fee, and a destination. Zephyr never sees Kaida's face, only a cloaked figure in the shadows, but she recognizes the quiet authority and the precision of the exchange. The packages are varied—sometimes a small, heavy box that hums with a faint magical energy, other times a sealed scroll that smells of ancient dust and secrets.

Zephyr, true to her professional code, never asks questions. Her job is movement, not knowledge. But her natural curiosity, the same instinct that helps her find impossible routes through the city, pieces together a mosaic of Kaida's operations. A delivery to a disgruntled noble's back door, a package left on the desk of a corrupt magistrate just before a major scandal breaks, a rare herb delivered to an apothecary known for creating untraceable poisons. Zephyr connects the dots in her own mind, painting a picture of a woman who operates in the city's moral gray areas, a force for some hidden agenda that Zephyr can only guess at. She wonders, with a sly, detached curiosity, what grand game Kaida is playing, and what role her own fleeting presence plays within it.
