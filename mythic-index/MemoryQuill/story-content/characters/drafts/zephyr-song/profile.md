## Physical Description

Zephyr Song is a charcoal-furred tabaxi whose coat carries an unusual pattern—tiny flecks of silver-white scattered across her fur like stars against a night sky, though in direct sunlight they seem to shimmer with an opalescent quality, as if dusted with crushed pearls. Since the Couatl's blessing, some of these flecks have elongated into actual tiny feather patterns, barely visible except when light catches them at the right angle, creating the illusion of plumage hidden within fur. Her fur is short and sleek, practical for someone who spends their life in motion, with slightly longer tufts at her elbows and ankles that flutter when she moves at speed.

Her wind-bright amber eyes hold a perpetual spark of motion, the pupils constantly adjusting as if tracking invisible trajectories through the air. They catch light like a cat's but hold something else—rings of rose-gold around the pupils that glow faintly in dawn or dusk light, and occasional flickers that shift between gold and pearl, like sunrise reflected in crystal. Those who look closely swear they can see fleeting glimpses of what's about to happen reflected in them, like watching time flow backwards for just a heartbeat.

Standing at five feet eight inches with the characteristic feline grace of her people, she has a runner's build—lean muscle wrapped in fluid efficiency. Her shoulders are broader than typical for tabaxi women, developed from years of catching herself on walls and swinging from anchor points. Her hands are her most distinctive feature: long-fingered even by tabaxi standards, with retractable claws she keeps meticulously filed to precise points—not for combat, but for finding purchase on the smallest imperfections in stone and wood. Her paw pads are dark gray, almost black, with unusual hardness from years of wall-running.

Her tail is her emotional barometer—longer than her height and constantly in motion, it serves as both balance and communication. The tip has developed an iridescent quality since her transformation, shifting from charcoal to true black with hints of rainbow shimmer in morning light. When she's still (a rare occurrence), it counts time with metronomic precision. When she's preparing for something requiring intense focus, it coils tight around her waist like a spring under tension. At dawn, the iridescent tip leaves faint trails of pearl-gold light when she moves at supernatural speed.

Her ears are tall and alert, with small notches in the left one—not from battle, but from a childhood accident that she claims helps her "hear the wind better." The tips have gained the same iridescent quality as her tail since the Couatl's blessing, shifting between pearl and rainbow hues in dawn light. The insides are pale pink, almost translucent, and flush darker when she's exerted herself. She has a habit of flicking them independently when processing multiple streams of information—a visible sign of her accelerated mental processing.

## Appearance & Attire

Zephyr's clothing is a study in functional elegance. Her primary garment is a set of movement-cut leathers in deep burgundy, almost black in low light, with strategic panels of more flexible material at every joint. The leather itself is unusually thin—lamb or kid rather than cow—treated with oils that keep it supple and nearly silent when she moves. The cut is asymmetrical, with the left side featuring additional securing straps to keep everything in place during inverted movement.

Her courser's scarf is her most treasured non-weapon possession—a length of pearl-gray silk that seems to float rather than hang, embroidered with tiny dawn-feather motifs in thread-of-gold so fine they're only visible up close. She wears it wrapped twice around her neck with the ends trailing to mid-back, and it somehow never tangles no matter how she moves. Those who've seen her in action swear it responds to her movement, flowing out of the way of grappling hands or spreading like wings when she jumps.

Her boots deserve special mention—double-laced with both traditional grommets and a speed-lacing system that lets her adjust tension on the fly. The soles are an unusual hybrid: soft enough to feel texture through them, firm enough for edge work, with a subtle curve that lets her run on walls longer than physics should allow. The leather is dyed to match her fur, making it hard to tell where boot ends and leg begins. Hidden in the right boot is a slim throwing knife; the left conceals lockpicks.

She wears minimal armor—a reinforced vest under her leathers that protects vital organs without restricting flexibility. The vest has attachment points for her various equipment, distributed to maintain perfect balance. Her messenger's satchel rides at her lower back, specially designed to stay flat against her body with contents secured in individual pockets to prevent shifting during acrobatics.

Her jewelry is minimal but meaningful: the thumb-ring on her weapon hand is carved from a single piece of clouded jade, a focusing aid for blade work. Around her left wrist, she wears a bracelet of tiny silver bells that she can silence with a twist—when they ring, it means she's choosing to be heard. 

Her left ear bears a single piercing—a small silver ring shaped like a coiled serpent with outstretched wings, a gift that appeared in her belongings the morning after the Dawn Bargain. The metal is always warm to the touch and sometimes catches light that isn't there, creating brief rainbow refractions. She's never been able to remove it, not that she's tried very hard; it feels like part of her now, humming with the same frequency as her heartbeat at dawn. She sometimes weaves tiny feathers into the fur behind her ears—always real feathers she's found, never purchased, each one a memory of a particularly impressive maneuver.

## The Dawn Trail Effect

When Zephyr moves at supernatural speed, particularly during the liminal hours of dawn and dusk, witnesses describe a phenomenon that defies easy explanation. She doesn't simply move fast—she seems to pull fragments of morning light with her. 

At full speed, she leaves behind faint wisps of pearl-and-gold luminescence that fade after a few heartbeats, like catching glimpses of sunrise through moving silk. Tiny, translucent feathers of pure light drift in her wake, visible only for moments before dissolving into the air. During true dawn, her rapid movement stirs an opalescent mist that carries the scent of rain on distant mountains and jasmine blooming in first light.

Those who've witnessed her at peak velocity during sunrise describe what they call the "comet effect"—a streak of dawn light with a feathered tail, as if she's become a fragment of morning itself racing through the city. The effect is strongest when she's fulfilling the Couatl's purpose, suggesting the phenomenon is not merely cosmetic but a visible manifestation of celestial power flowing through her.

In her shadow during these moments, careful observers might glimpse something impossible: the faint outline of wings that aren't there, rainbow-feathered and vast, folding and unfolding with each leap and bound. Animals, particularly birds, will often follow the light trails she leaves, circling the fading wisps as if drawn to something holy.
