## History

- Childhood: Her grandmother, a lay member of the Temple of Tidal Courts, introduced her to the faith's practical theology when Rill was seven. While other children learned their letters, Rill learned to read currents and taste the difference between willing water and water under duress.
- Education/Training: The Temple recognized her gift early—not just her genasi heritage, but her unusual ability to hear what the water was really saying beneath its surface movements.

## The Philosophy of Negotiated Elements

Where others see water as a resource to be controlled or a force to be conquered, Rill understands it as a living expression of Istishia's ever-changing nature. Her approach to water management isn't about dominance but diplomacy, rooted in the Temple teaching that water is the physical manifestation of change itself—never created or destroyed, only transformed and traveling.

This isn't mysticism to Rill—it's observable fact blessed by divine truth. Rivers that are "asked" to change course cause less erosion. Harbors that receive proper offerings (usually returned water from their own body, poured with intention while invoking Istishia's aspects) suffer fewer rogue waves. Storm systems addressed with formal courtesy and recognition of their divine nature often shift their worst fury elsewhere. 

The Temple teaches that Istishia doesn't micromanage every drop of rain or wave in the ocean. Instead, the god imbued water with its own form of consciousness—not thought as humans understand it, but memory, preference, and will. Every body of water is both itself and part of Istishia's greater being, deserving respect not just as divine creation but as a neighbor with whom one must coexist.

## The Temple of Tidal Courts

Rill maintains standing in the Temple of Tidal Courts—a religious organization dedicated to Istishia, the Elemental Lord of Water, though their practice bears little resemblance to conventional worship. They don't build temples of stone but recognize sacred spaces where water changes form: estuaries where rivers meet seas, springs where groundwater emerges, cataracts where streams become mist.

The Tidal Courts teach that Istishia doesn't demand worship but rather partnership. Water is change incarnate—it flows, freezes, evaporates, condenses, always becoming something else while remaining essentially itself. The faithful of the Courts don't pray for intervention; they negotiate on behalf of both water and civilization, maintaining the ancient contracts that allow the two to coexist.

Members meet at irregular intervals determined by tidal calendars and rainfall patterns. They wear no unified vestments but carry similar tokens—smooth stones worn by water, vials of water from significant negotiations, copper coins green with verdigris from harbor offerings. Their ceremonies involve pouring water from one vessel to another while discussing the "mood" of local water bodies, sharing observations about which channels have grown "irritable," which harbors seem "pleased" with recent offerings, where new construction has created "arguments" between water bodies.

The Temple maintains the Ledger of Agreements—an ever-expanding record of successful negotiations between communities and their waters. Written on specially treated vellum that won't dissolve even when submerged, these documents record not laws but understandings: this river agrees to maintain its banks if its fish stocks are protected; that harbor will remain calm during loading if it receives a tithe of clean water from every ship.
