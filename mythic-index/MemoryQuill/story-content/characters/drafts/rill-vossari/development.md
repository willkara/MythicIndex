# Rill Vossari – Character Development

## Personality Core

- Defining Traits: Patient, measured, practical, absolute moral code regarding respect for water and nature.
- Core Values: Respect for water, belief in negotiation over dominance, honoring agreements.
- Motivations: Maintaining the balance between civilization and nature, upholding the contracts of the Tidal Courts.
- Fears: The possibility that the waters will stop listening and that humanity will push past a boundary of disrespect, leading to catastrophe.
- Internal Conflicts: Balancing her role as a mediator between the modern world and ancient natural forces.
- Alignment: Lawful Neutral

> **Alignment Rationale: Lawful Neutral**
>
> **1. Good vs. Neutral on the Moral Axis**
>
> Lawful Good characters are driven by moral imperatives: protect the weak, champion fairness, alleviate suffering. Their “law” is usually tied to kindness and justice.
>
> Lawful Neutral characters prioritize order, structure, and cosmic balance over compassion. They’re not cruel, but they aren’t primarily motivated by mercy either — they act according to rules, obligations, or natural law.
>
> 👉 Rill cares deeply about respect and balance, but not in a moralizing sense. She doesn’t protect humans because she believes they deserve it inherently — she negotiates because it keeps the balance between people and water intact. She’ll save a drowning person, yes, but because she sees it as part of maintaining harmony, not necessarily because “saving people is good.”
>
> **2. Her Relationship to “Law”**
>
> She clearly follows law, but not man’s law.
>
> She respects contracts with rivers, tides, and storms.
>
> She honors Istishia’s divine structure: change, memory, reciprocity.
>
> She upholds Temple traditions and rituals.
>
> When mortals disrespect water, she resists, not out of moral outrage, but because they broke the contract.
>
> This is very Lawful Neutral thinking: “These are the rules of existence. Break them, and there are consequences.”
>
> **3. Where She Deviates from Lawful Good**
>
> A Lawful Good character might argue: “We must reroute this canal to save lives, even if the river protests.”
>
> Rill would argue: “If the river isn’t consulted, the bargain is broken, and that will bring disaster.”
>
> Her loyalty is first to the laws of nature and Istishia, not to the moral imperative of human survival or comfort.
>
> That doesn’t make her uncaring — it makes her pragmatic and consistent with her chosen law.
>
> **4. Verdict**
>
> You’re right: Rill sits much closer to Lawful Neutral than Lawful Good.
>
> She isn’t selfish or cruel → not Evil.
>
> She isn’t motivated primarily by altruism → not purely Good.
>
> She is motivated by structure, balance, and obligation → Lawful Neutral.
>
> She’s the type of character who might let a plan fail if it violates the “contract” with water, even if it would save more people in the short term — because the long-term consequences of breaking natural law would be worse.
>
> ✨ Refined Alignment: Rill “Tidemender” Vossari is Lawful Neutral — an arbiter of elemental law, dedicated to balance and cosmic reciprocity above mortal definitions of good or evil.

## Current Concerns & Future Currents

Lately, Rill has noticed troubling patterns. Waters that have been calm for generations are growing restless. Rivers are "forgetting" agreements that have stood for centuries. The deep harbor waters whisper about something stirring in the far ocean, something that doesn't recognize the old contracts between civilization and sea.

She's been preparing—not for battle, but for what might be the negotiation of her lifetime. She's studying the oldest water-treaties, learning the formal forms of address used when the first cities made peace with their rivers. She's also training apprentices, teaching them that water-work isn't about power but about patience, respect, and the understanding that water has been here far longer than any of them and will remain long after they're gone.

There's a prophecy among the Tidal Courts about a Great Argument coming—a time when all waters will need to decide whether to continue cooperating with land-dwellers. Rill doesn't believe in prophecies as such, but she believes in preparation. She's been leaving more offerings, carving more names into her spear, building more trust. If the Great Argument comes, she intends to be ready with a compelling case for continued cooperation.
