## Physical Description

Rill Vossari's appearance immediately marks her as water-touched. Her skin has the quality of sea-glass—a pale, translucent blue-green that seems to shift in depth depending on the light. In shadow or moonlight, observers can see darker turquoise currents moving beneath her skin, swirling gently on her cheeks, jawline, and throat. When she's actively working with water, these currents quicken into mesmerizing patterns that flow toward her hands.

Standing at five feet ten inches with a strong, athletic swimmer's build, Rill has a solid, grounded posture. Her shoulders are broad from years of rope work, her arms corded with lean muscle. Her hands are a worker's—callused and scarred from dock work, yet they move with a fluid, hypnotic grace. Her expression is often one of calm, patient focus, but can sharpen into resolute intensity when she is observing the water or engaged in a negotiation.

Her hair is her most striking feature: thick, rope-like dreadlocks braided into practical tails. The color is a natural gradient, shifting from deep sea-green at the roots to a pale, sea-foam white at the tips. She binds these braids with tarnished copper wire that has developed a verdigris patina from constant water exposure, and adorns them with weathered wooden beads carved with the names of significant waters.

Her eyes are the soft, clouded gray of rain about to fall. The color shifts with weather and mood—slate before storms, silver in sunlight. In the right light, the irises seem to contain moving clouds, as if reflecting a sky that isn't there. When she is in deep communion with her element, her eyes flood entirely with gray, an unnerving effect that marks her focus.

## Appearance & Attire

Rill's clothing speaks to function over form, yet carries its own weathered elegance. Her primary garment is a weighted oilskin longcoat in deep harbor blue, treated to repel water. The coat reaches to mid-calf, its hem weighted to keep it from billowing in the wind. Bronze clasps, green with verdigris, run down the front.

Beneath the coat, she wears practical sailor's clothing: a soft linen shirt the color of sea foam and durable canvas trousers reinforced at the knees. The trousers end just below her knees, transitioning to wrapped leather gaiters that allow for flexibility while leaving her ankles bare—she claims she needs skin contact to properly feel water temperature and current. Her feet are usually bare, with soles as tough as leather from years of walking on wet stone and dock wood.

A masterwork sailor's harness of braided rope and leather is worn over her coat. Reinforced with iron rings, it serves as a tool belt, safety line attachment, and leverage point for hauling. From it hang marline spikes, a folding knife, coils of rope, and corked vials for water samples.

Around her neck on a simple cord hangs her only obvious religious symbol: a small vial of ever-moving water, blessed by the Temple of Tidal Courts. It emits a soft blue light in the presence of large bodies of water, and she touches it reflexively when beginning negotiations.
