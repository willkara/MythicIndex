## Professional Relationships

- **With Korrath & Grimjaw**: A collegial rivalry exists between her fluid dynamics and their structural engineering. Their arguments become blueprints, each pushing the other to find solutions that respect both stone and stream. She's taught them that water always wins eventually, but it can be convinced to win slowly.
- **With Rylan**: They share philosophical discussions about wild versus rightful weather. Rylan sees wind as freedom; Rill sees water as responsibility. Their debates during storms have become legendary—two elementalists standing in the rain, formally discussing whether this particular downpour has "legitimate grievances."
- **With Marcus**: They occupy parallel but separate spheres. He bargains with people using coin and favor; she bargains with rivers using respect and reciprocity. He's learned not to offer her gold for "making" water cooperate. She's learned not to judge his methods—people, unlike rivers, sometimes need to be bribed rather than reasoned with.
