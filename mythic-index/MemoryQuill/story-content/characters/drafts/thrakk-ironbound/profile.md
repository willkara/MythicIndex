## Physical Description

Thrakk Ironbound embodies the contradictions of his journey—a warrior's bearing softened by conscience, hobgoblin severity tempered by dwarven blessing. Standing at six feet three inches, he possesses the characteristic hobgoblin build: lean, corded muscle over a frame built for endurance rather than bulk. His posture remains military-perfect even in casual moments, shoulders squared and spine straight, though five years of protecting rather than conquering has added a watchful stillness to his bearing that replaces the predatory tension of his Legion days.

His skin is deep crimson, the color of dried blood or dark wine, with a texture like worn leather from decades of campaign life. A network of scars tells the story of his service—thin white lines from elven arrows, puckered marks from human spears, and one distinctive curved scar across his ribs where the Bloodsworn's blade nearly ended his life. These scars have become a kind of armor, proof of survival and transformation.

His face carries the sharp, angular features common to hobgoblins—high cheekbones, a strong jaw, and a prominent nose that's been broken and reset at least twice. Deep-set eyes the color of burnished amber hold an intensity that can shift from tactical assessment to unexpected warmth, particularly when speaking with Mira or the orphans of Stoneford Crossing. Crow's feet have begun to form at their corners, not from age alone but from five years of genuine smiles replacing twenty-three years of grimaces.

His black hair, once worn in the regulation Legion topknot, is now kept shorter and practical, streaked with premature iron-gray that began appearing after his transformation. He maintains a close-cropped beard in the hobgoblin military style, though he's adopted the dwarven practice of braiding small honor-beads into it—gifts from grateful families he's protected.

## The Stone Arm

Thrakk's left arm is his most distinctive feature—a divine transformation that serves as both blessing and reminder. From shoulder to fingertips, the limb appears carved from a single piece of granite, shot through with veins of silver that pulse with faint light when he acts in accordance with his oath of protection. The stone is not uniformly gray but contains subtle variations—darker bands that spiral around the bicep, lighter patches at the joints that allow for movement.

The arm moves with surprising fluidity despite its appearance, each finger articulating perfectly. The surface is smooth but not polished, maintaining the slight roughness of worked stone. In cold weather, the arm remains warm to the touch; in heat, it stays cool—a constant, comfortable temperature that seems to radiate from within. When he clenches his fist, the sound is like distant thunder in mountains.

The transformation extends slightly onto his chest, where veins of stone spread from his shoulder like roots, creating an organic pattern that resembles both tree branches and river deltas. These stone veins pulse with silver light when he fights to protect innocents, growing brighter the more desperate the defense.

## Appearance & Attire

Thrakk's attire reflects his transformed role—no longer the uniform of conquest but the practical gear of a protector. His primary armor is a customized breastplate of dwarven make, a gift from Stoneford Crossing's smiths. The steel is blued to a deep midnight color and bears the Iron Guard's symbol on the chest: a bridge formed from a hobgoblin spear and a dwarven hammer crossed. The armor is designed to accommodate his stone arm, with special articulation at the left shoulder.

Beneath the armor, he wears a gambeson of quilted gray wool, practical and warm for mountain patrols. The garment is well-maintained but shows signs of repeated mending—Thrakk insists on repairing rather than replacing gear that still serves its purpose, a philosophy he extends to people as well. The sleeves are different lengths—the right extends to his wrist, while the left is cut short at the shoulder to avoid interfering with his stone arm's movement.

His lower body is protected by reinforced leather pants in dark brown, with steel plates riveted to protect the thighs and shins. The style is a hybrid of hobgoblin military efficiency and dwarven craftsmanship—lighter than full plate but offering superior protection to standard leather. His boots are military issue from his Legion days, repeatedly resoled but maintained with almost religious devotion. Steel caps protect the toes, and the soles are hobnailed for grip on mountain stone.

Over all this, in weather or ceremony, he wears a cloak that tells two stories. One half is hobgoblin military red, taken from his old Legion captain's cloak; the other half is Stoneford Crossing blue, sewn from a banner gifted by the town. The two halves are joined with a seam of silver thread—Mira's work—that forms a pattern of small bridges down the center. The cloak is weighted and can be used to confuse opponents in combat or wrapped around his stone arm to conceal its nature when discretion is needed.

## Equipment & Weapons

His ancestral spear remains his primary weapon, though it now serves ceremonial purposes more often than martial ones. The weapon stands six feet in length, with a haft of black ironwood that's been in his family for seven generations. The spearhead is distinctive—forged in the old Dhakaani style with one edge serrated for catching and controlling enemy weapons, the other smooth for clean thrusts. Goblin script runs along the haft, recently joined by Dwarvish runes that Mira added with his permission: "Honor is the bridge between enemies."

For daily carry, he favors a more practical sword—a dwarven-forged longsword with a simple crossguard and a grip wrapped in worn leather. The blade bears no ornamentation save for quality; it's a tool, not a trophy. He wears it on his right hip, having trained himself to draw and fight right-handed since his transformation, though his stone arm serves as a devastating defensive tool.

Various pouches and containers hang from his belt: signal whistles in different tones for commanding the Iron Guard, a healer's kit he's learned to use with surprising skill, and a small leather journal where he records the names of those the Guard protects. A wooden tankard hangs from a hook—a gift from a grateful innkeeper, it's become his signature in taverns across the frontier.

## Personal Effects

Around his neck on a simple iron chain hangs an unusual talisman—a small piece of stone that exactly matches his transformed arm, carved into the shape of a hammer and spear crossed. It was Mira's gift on the first anniversary of the siege, blessed by both a priest of Moradin and, surprisingly, a hobgoblin shaman who had heard of Thrakk's transformation and traveled weeks to see it.

In his belt pouch, he carries three significant items: a handful of earth from his grandfather's grave (taken before his exile), a small vial of water from the well at Stoneford Crossing (renewed yearly), and one of Thane Brokk's beard-beads that Mira gave him—silver with the Granitevein family mark.

His quarters at Iron Guard Keep contain his most precious possession: a growing collection of children's drawings, gifts from the orphanage. He's had them carefully preserved and framed, hanging them opposite his ancestral spear. When asked why, he simply says, "To remember what we're fighting for."

## Physical Mannerisms

Thrakk's movement patterns reveal his dual nature. He retains the hobgoblin military gait—efficient, measured steps that eat ground without seeming hurried. But he's developed a habit of letting his stone hand trail along walls as he walks, feeling the texture of stone and wood, a meditative practice that keeps him connected to Moradin's blessing.

When thinking, he drums his stone fingers against his leg, creating a rhythm like rain on stone. The sound often helps calm frightened children—he's learned to vary the rhythm to create simple melodies. In combat, his fighting style has evolved to incorporate his arm's unique properties: using it to block blades that would shatter normal bone, crushing enemy weapons with grip strength no mortal could match, and creating unexpected percussion strikes that can stun opponents.

His voice carries the gravelly tones common to hobgoblins but has developed a warmth absent from his Legion days. He speaks Common with a slight accent that becomes pronounced when emotional. When speaking Dwarvish (which Mira has been teaching him), his stone arm resonates slightly, adding an unusual harmonic quality to the words—a phenomenon that dwarven priests find fascinating.

## Notable Features

- **Battle Breathing:** His lung injury, though healed, left him with slightly labored breathing during intense exertion. He's learned to control it, but observant individuals notice the slight wheeze during extended combat.

- **Stone Sense:** His transformed arm grants him an unusual ability to sense vibrations through stone—useful for detecting approaching enemies in mountain terrain or finding weaknesses in fortifications.

- **Temperature Resistance:** His stone arm is immune to temperature extremes, allowing him to handle hot forge metal or breaking ice with equal ease.

- **Divine Resonance:** In the presence of divine magic, particularly that of Moradin or other gods of protection and craft, his stone arm glows with soft silver light. The effect is involuntary and has occasionally revealed hidden shrines or blessed items.

- **Tactical Tells:** Years of military service have left him with unconscious habits—he automatically assesses defensive positions when entering new spaces, counts exits, and positions himself to protect others' flanks without thinking about it.

## Evolution & Growth

The Thrakk who leads the Iron Guard is markedly different from the Legion captain of five years ago, though the core of military discipline remains. He's learned to see strength in mercy, tactics in protection rather than conquest, and honor in building rather than destroying. His stone arm serves as a constant reminder of his transformation—not just physical, but spiritual.

He's developed an unexpected capacity for mentorship, taking young recruits from various races and teaching them not just combat but the philosophy of protective service. His teaching method combines hobgoblin tactical doctrine with dwarven steadfastness and human adaptability—creating warriors who think as well as fight.

Most remarkably, he's learned to be a father figure to Mira, though neither uses that word aloud. Their relationship—built on shared loss, mutual respect, and growing affection—has become the emotional cornerstone of his new life. Through her eyes, he's learned to see his transformation not as a curse or mere blessing, but as an opportunity to become the bridge between worlds that both their peoples desperately need.
