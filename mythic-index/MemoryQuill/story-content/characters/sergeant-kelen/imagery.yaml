appearance: "Sergeant Kelen Harwick cuts the figure of a steadfast veteran, his solid 5'10\" frame built with the functional strength of a career soldier. At 44 years old, his iron-gray hair is kept in a strict regulation cut, thinning slightly at the temples above weathered brown eyes framed by deep crow's feet. Years of service have left their physical mark in an old knife scar tracing his left jawline, while his hands are a scarred roadmap of callouses, burns, and nicks. He is typically clad in immaculately maintained City Guard plate armor, carrying a heavy shield used primarily for protecting others. Despite a barely noticeable limp from an old leg injury, he moves with economical precision and maintains perfect military posture, projecting an aura of quiet, enduring authority."
