# Sergeant Kelen – Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: Waterdeep's Dock Ward - specifically the Fishgut Court tenements
- **Birth Date**: Born during the harsh winter of the Year of the Broken Blade
- **Social Class**: Lower class - dockworker family living in overcrowded conditions
- **Cultural Background**: Urban poor, shaped by the harsh realities of Waterdeep's most dangerous district. Learned early that survival meant structure, loyalty, and watching out for your own.

## Family
- **Father**: Jorik Harwick - dockworker lost in a shipping accident when Kelen was 12. Taught Kelen the value of hard work and keeping your word. His death left the family destitute.
- **Mother**: Mara Harwick - seamstress who took in piecework to support the family. Died of lung fever two years after Jorik's death, worn down by poverty and grief.
- **Spouse**: Anya Harwick (née Millwright) - met her when she was a baker's assistant. Married young for love and stability. She died from red fever during an epidemic ten years ago, leaving Kelen to raise Elspeth alone.
- **Daughter**: Elspeth Harwick, now 22 - apprenticed to Master Bookbinder Aldric Thornton in the Trades Ward. Bright, independent, and skilled with her hands like her grandmother. 
- **Family Dynamics**: 
  - Lost his parents early, learned responsibility young
  - With Anya: Brief happiness interrupted by tragedy - her death taught him that love makes you vulnerable
  - With Elspeth: Protective but distant - sends most of his pay, writes weekly letters, visits rarely to keep her safe from his dangerous work
  - Fears that getting too close to people leads to loss, but can't stop himself from caring
