# Nireya Voss - Comedy Writing Guide

## Comedy Archetype: The Morbidly Cheerful Medium

### Core Comedy Style
**Death jokes with a smile / Liminal existence humor / Pickled quince obsession**

Nireya is funny because she's a half-living spirit medium who makes TERRIBLE jokes about death that only the team understands. She's casually morbid, exists between worlds, and has an inexplicable guilty obsession with pickled quince. Dark humor meets everyday absurdity.

### What Makes Her Funny

- **Terrible death jokes** - She thinks they're hilarious
- **Casual morbidity** - Discusses death like weather
- **Pickled quince obsession** - "Guilty gusto" when caught
- **Day/night split personality** - Literally changes with time
- **One-sided ghost conversations** - Pauses to listen to dead people
- **Weaponizing citrus** - Her words, somehow serious
- **"Those were names"** - Transforms into terrifying divine being

### Example Comedy Moments

```
Nireya: "The crossing here was clean. Nobody got lost in the in-between. Well, except Gerald, but he's always been bad with directions."
Veyra: "...Gerald?"
Nireya: "Dead merchant. Wandered into the wrong afterlife. I had to redirect him. He apologized profusely."
Finn: "The dead... apologize?"
Nireya: "The polite ones do. Gerald's very considerate for a confused spirit."
Grimjaw: "This is the strangest conversation I've had. And I've talked to Marcus."
```

```
[Team finds Nireya eating pickled quince at midnight]
Thorne: "What are you doing up?"
Nireya: [caught, mouth full] "...midnight watch?"
Thorne: "With pickled quince?"
Nireya: "They're... for spiritual communion?"
Thorne: "Really."
Nireya: [defeated] "I like them and I'm ashamed."
Thorne: "...Why ashamed?"
Nireya: "They're PICKLED QUINCE. Nobody should like them this much."
Aldwin: [passing by] "I've added them to your food requests."
Nireya: "DON'T ENABLE ME."
```

```
Nireya: [making flower crown for crying child]
Child: "Are you a ghost?"
Nireya: "Only half. The other half is regular person."
Child: "Which half?"
Nireya: [gesturing down her literal split] "Left is living, right is death. Try to step on both sides equally when you walk past me. It's good luck."
Child: "Does it hurt?"
Nireya: "Only when I stub my toe. Then the living side feels it and the death side judges me for poor spatial awareness."
Child: [giggles]
Mother: [to Thorne] "Is she... alright?"
Thorne: "She's our spiritual specialist."
Mother: "...Oh."
```

```
[During serious tactical briefing]
Marcus: "The target is heavily guarded—"
Nireya: [pauses, tilts head]
Marcus: "...Is she listening?"
Veyra: "She's listening to someone we can't hear."
Nireya: [to empty air] "Yes, I know. That's very interesting. No, I can't ask him that right now— [pause] Because we're PLANNING, Gerald—"
Grimjaw: "Is she arguing with a ghost?"
Nireya: [to team] "Gerald says the target has a weak heart. Literally. Left ventricle. He died of similar condition."
Marcus: "...That's useful intelligence."
Nireya: [to air] "See? HELPFUL. Now please let me focus."
```

```
[Someone makes easy death joke]
Nireya: "Oh! Like when the funeral director said business was 'dead' but I said it was actually 'lively' because of all the spirits? And then he asked me to leave?"
[Silence]
Nireya: "...I thought it was funny."
Vera: "It was terrible."
Nireya: "Thank you!"
Vera: "That wasn't a compliment."
Nireya: "I'm taking it as one. I'm 'dying' to make more jokes."
[Groans from everyone]
Nireya: [delighted]
```

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't make her actually scary all the time** - Save Banshee form for serious moments
❌ **Don't ignore her vulnerability** - Transformation drains her
❌ **Don't mock her earnestness** - She genuinely cares about the dead
❌ **Don't make death jokes AT her** - She makes them, others groan
❌ **Don't trivialize her purpose** - Guardian of souls is serious

### DO This Instead

✅ **Let her make terrible puns about death** - Team groans, she's delighted
✅ **Show day/night personality shift** - Literally changes with time
✅ **Pickled quince as guilty pleasure** - Embarrassed when caught
✅ **One-sided conversations with ghosts** - Gerald is regular contributor
✅ **Casual morbidity contrasts team's reactions** - "What's wrong? I just said—"
✅ **Her "Banshee form" terrifies even team** - Comedy stops when souls threatened

### Relationship Dynamics

**With Aldwin:** Kindred spirits (literally)
- Both understand liminal states
- He makes her tea after transformations
- She helps him with dying patients
- Mutual respect for boundaries

**With Finn:** Confuses the earnest one
- He's earnest about animals, she's earnest about death
- Both misunderstood by others
- She protects him (living are precious)
- He worries about her (is she okay?)

**With The Team:** Morbid family member
- They've accepted her death jokes (reluctantly)
- Know when to give her space (post-transformation)
- Aldwin keeps pickled quince stocked (enabler)
- They're used to one-sided ghost conversations

**With Vera & Echo:** Death meets wilderness
- Both exist between worlds
- Echo judges her jokes (harsh caws)
- Vera appreciates dark humor
- Both protective of the vulnerable

### Signature Comedy Beats

1. **Terrible Death Pun** → Team Groans → Nireya Delighted → "I'm 'dying' here"
2. **Pauses Mid-Conversation** → Listens to Ghost → Relays Information → "Gerald says—"
3. **Caught With Quince** → Defensive → Admits Shame → "Don't enable me"
4. **Day/Night Shift** → Personality Changes → Team Adjusts → New Time Reference
5. **Makes Flower Crown** → For Distressed Person → While Discussing Death Casually

### Voice Pattern Notes

**Speech Style:** Measured/formal when channeling, surprisingly playful normally
**Signature Phrases:**
- "The crossing here was clean"
- "Death is not the enemy - abandonment is"
- "Gerald says—" (their resident ghost)
- "Those were names" (warning before transformation)
- "I'm 'dying' to..." (puns)
- "Don't enable me" (about quince)

**Emotional Tells:**
- Tattoos pulse with spirit activity
- Right side more translucent when stressed
- Voice distant when channeling
- Guilty expression when caught with quince

### Running Gag Opportunities

- **"Gerald Says"** - Their resident ghost informant
- **Pickled Quince Obsession** - Hidden stashes, guilty eating
- **Terrible Death Puns** - Team groans, she's delighted
- **Day/Night Personality** - Time-based shift
- **One-Sided Conversations** - Pauses to hear ghosts
- **Flower Crowns** - Makes them from scraps for sad people
- **"Weaponizing Citrus"** - Her phrase, somehow serious

### Quick Reference

**Nireya is funny when:**
- Making terrible death puns
- Caught eating pickled quince guiltily
- Having one-sided ghost conversations
- Day/night personality shifts
- Casual morbidity vs. team reactions

**Nireya is NOT funny when:**

### The Golden Rule

Nireya is funniest when her cheerful, casual approach to death and the afterlife contrasts with normal people's discomfort. She makes puns, eats pickled quince guiltily, and has helpful conversations with ghosts named Gerald. But threaten souls and she becomes something ELSE entirely.

### Special Notes

**The Gerald Situation:**
- Recurring ghost informant
- Bad with directions (in afterlife)
- Polite and helpful
- Team accepts his existence
- "Gerald says—" becomes shorthand
- He has OPINIONS (helpful ones)

**Pickled Quince:**
- Guilty pleasure
- "Nobody should like them this much"
- Hidden stashes discovered
- Aldwin enables her (orders them)
- Embarrassed when caught
- "Guilty gusto" consumption
- Comfort food after transformations

**Day/Night Split:**
- Daylight: "living" side dominant, more present
- Darkness: "death" side awakens, more spiritual
- Midnight-dawn: peak spiritual connection
- Team learns her rhythms
- Different personality based on time
- Not Jekyll/Hyde, just... different emphases

**The Transformation:**
- "Those were names" = warning
- Goes from cheerful to TERRIFYING
- Divine aspect/Banshee form
- Team saw it once (Corsic Drell)
- Thorne: "Gods preserve us"
- Nireya: "Not gods. Just oaths."
- After: hypersensitive, emotionally raw
- Needs grounding (Aldwin's tea, pickled quince)
- Comedy STOPS during this

**The Death Jokes:**
- She thinks they're hilarious
- Team groans (affectionately)
- She's DELIGHTED by groans
- Makes them worse intentionally
- "I'm 'dying' to make more"
- Only SHE can make death jokes
- Others making them: not funny
- Her making them: endearing/annoying
