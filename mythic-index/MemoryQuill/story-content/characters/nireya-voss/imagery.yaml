appearance: "Nireya Voss is a Half-Elf Kalashtar spiritualist whose physical form is starkly divided down the center, a living embodiment of her dual existence between mortal and spirit realms. Her left side appears as a healthy living elf with warm tan skin, a piercing green almond-shaped eye, and long, wavy dark brown hair partially kept in a neat braid. In contrast, her right side is a spectral manifestation of glowing, pale blue-white energy, where her eye is a featureless orb of white light and her translucent skin is marked by branching, lightning-like fissures. Her hair on this spectral side dissolves into swirling blue smoke, matching the ethereal energy surrounding the rough wooden staff topped with a human skull that she holds in her glowing hand. Her attire reflects this dichotomy, featuring detailed embossed golden-brown leather armor with a green gem insert over a teal tunic on her living half, contrasted by dark indigo, smoke-like fabric draped over her spectral shoulder. With a composed yet intense expression, she stands as a literal bridge between worlds, her figure visually balanced between an autumn forest background and swirling spiritual energy."
