# Nireya Voss - Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: The Echoing Depths - a planar convergence point where the Material Plane touches Dolurrh (Realm of the Dead)
- **Birth Date**: Born during a rare triple eclipse when the boundaries between planes were thinnest
- **Social Class**: Temple-raised; her birth was prophesied and she was given to clerics at infancy
- **Cultural Background**: Kalashtar - a race of humans with a unique connection to spirits and the dream realm
- **Divine Marking**: At the instant of her first breath, three gods who rarely agree came to accord and marked her soul

## Family
- **Parents**: Mother was a temple healer who died in childbirth; father unknown (possibly touched by the divine)
- **Siblings**: None by blood; raised alongside other temple orphans
- **Extended Family**: The clerics of Kelemvor who raised her after the divine marking
- **Family Dynamics**: Treated with reverence and fear by her temple family; isolated but protected

## The Pact of Three
At her birth, three gods converged in unprecedented accord:

- **Kelemvor (God of the Dead)**: To ensure the final rest is honored and not twisted
- **Jergal (The Scribe of the Doomed)**: To record every death as it should be, not as mortals manipulate it
- **Silvanus (God of Nature)**: To protect the balance—the cycle of life and death without interference

Together, they marked her as:
- Mortal flesh, but anchored across realms
- Not a servant of one god, but a living clause in their shared covenant
- A correction to prevent dominion over the dead from falling into tyrants' hands

Her very existence is a safeguard—she is not wrathful, but inevitable. As the gods declared: "You are not our servant, Nireya Voss. You are our promise. And a promise must endure. Even when it weeps."

## History
- **Childhood**: 
  - First spoke to the dead at age seven when a temple acolyte died suddenly

## Personal Details
- **How She Relaxes**: She practices an art form known as "Silver-Seaming." It is the delicate process of repairing broken pottery or porcelain with a lacquer mixed with powdered silver. She finds a deep, philosophical peace in taking something shattered and making it whole again, not by hiding the cracks, but by highlighting them as a beautiful part of the object's history.
- **Favorite Meal**: A simple bowl of steamed rice with pickled quince and a single, perfectly poached egg. It's a meal of subtle, distinct flavors that requires mindful eating, helping to ground her senses. The pickled quince is so pungent that others joke about "weaponizing citrus" - but she genuinely loves it.
- **Favorite Drink**: Smokewood tea brewed with dried chrysanthemum petals and a single shard of sweet ice. She inhales the steam before each sip, listening for the faint echoes of those she guided that day.
- **Morning Ritual**: Takes bitter tea (forest and smoke flavors) before dawn, moving between soul-lanterns in the Sanctuary like a shrine the city forgot how to pray in
- **A Mundane Joy**: She finds a unique pleasure in the silence of a library or a scriptorium. The shared, unspoken respect for quiet is a sanctuary from the constant whispers of the spirit world.
- **A Love of Art**: She has a deep appreciation for sculpture and architecture. Because she can perceive the "echoes" of the past, she experiences art in a unique way. For her, a statue is not just a carved stone; she can faintly perceive the lingering emotions of the sculptor and the weight of the history it has witnessed.
- **Small Kindnesses**: Makes flower crowns for crying children, lights extra candles at shrines, tells mourners when their loved ones crossed cleanly
- **Private Habit**: Eats her pickled quince with "guilty gusto" when alone, knowing her oddness is part of her shape
