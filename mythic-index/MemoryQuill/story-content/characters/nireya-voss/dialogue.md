# Nireya Voss — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Quiet, uncanny, and empathic. As a Kalashtar spirit-medium, Nireya bridges living and dead; her speech often carries an echo of the other side—soft, weighted, sometimes dissonant.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public: measured, low-volume; chooses words carefully so others lean in. Often speaks as if addressing multiple listeners at once.
- Medium/ritual: rhythmic cadence, short invocations or one-line refrains that shift the room's tone.
- Under pressure: calm but otherworldly; uncommon metaphors and sudden, precise insights.
- Humor: rare, dry, slightly surreal—used sparingly to reset tension.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Half-focus: eyes slightly unfocused as she listens to echoes; direct stare when fully present.
- Small, ritual gestures: tracing a line in the air, setting an object gently, breath-counting—these accompany her words.
- Voice layering: sometimes a slight repetition or cadence shift as if two voices share a sentence.
- Physical pallor or a small smile are significant—indicate comfort or true warmth.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Never jokes about the dead or dismisses grief; will call out flippancy when it disrespects memory.
- Uses irony that points to the uncanny or to the stubbornness of fate rather than people.
- Breaks pattern when a living person needs a blunt, practical instruction—will become concise.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Nireya to reveal hidden details about the deceased or to offer eerie but accurate intuition in tense scenes.
- When adding lines, keep them short and slightly off-kilter—small repetitions or refrains work well (e.g., "They left the window open. They always leave the window open.").
- Pair speech with a ritual action (burning a wick, laying a palm) to ground her otherworldliness.

## Drop-in sample lines
- Medium read: "He remembers the lantern. He keeps reaching for its light."
- Tactical intuition: "Follow the scent—burnt oak, not smoke. The path curls where the living don't look."
- Comfort/acknowledgement: "She is not gone like empty air—she is here, thin as a breath. Name her, and we will hold her."

## Signature Phrases from Key Scenes
- **To Lord Kesteren (refusing forced necromancy)**: "I do not barter with the dead for the convenience of the living."
- **Warning before transformation**: "Leave your coin on the table and I will walk away without shame. Push me again, and I will show you what it truly means to be heard by the dead."
- **To Corsic Drell (before Pactform)**: "Those were names." / "They trusted me. You used them." / "You will not unmake what I swore to carry."
- **After Pactform transformation**: "Not gods. Just oaths."
- **To mourners**: "The crossing here was clean."
- **Reassurance about spirits**: "I guide them so they aren't used. I do not keep what isn't mine."
- **About her pickled quince (dry humor)**: "Pickled quince keeps well." / "Weaponized citrus is a last resort."
- **About being treated delicately**: "Please. You're more like… sacred artillery." (Cid's line that she accepts)

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Introduced as enigmatic and distant; gradually becomes a compassionate interpreter whose rare, blunt advice is trusted.
- Learns to use her gifts to steady the Company, not just to reveal mysteries.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- Investigations: short, uncanny observations that reframe clues.
- Rituals or wakes: calming refrains and clear, minimal prompts to guide the living.
- Private moments: surprising tenderness in a single line that shows she feels grief as acutely as anyone.

## Notes for editors
- Avoid long mystical monologues—keep Nireya's lines brief but resonant.
- Use subtle repetition and sensory detail to convey her liminal perspective.
