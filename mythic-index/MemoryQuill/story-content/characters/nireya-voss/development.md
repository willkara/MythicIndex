## Dream Sequences & Divine Visitation
After invoking the Pactform, her dreams take her to the place where the gods signed her soul:
- **The Setting**: A vast ink-black sea with a skeletal tree rising from the center. Names hang from its branches like glowing fruit
- **The Three Shadows**: Kelemvor, Jergal, and Silvanus wait at the tree's base
- **Kelemvor's Voice** (like a gavel on stone): "You honored the silence of the dead. That is justice."
- **Jergal's Record** (never raising his head): "Her ledger is heavy, but not out of balance. Continue."
- **Silvanus's Whisper** (breaking leaves and summer wind): "The forest weeps for every soul delayed. But you have made the soil whole again."
- **Their Unified Declaration**: "You are not our servant, Nireya Voss. You are our promise. And a promise must endure. Even when it weeps."

## The Company's Growing Understanding
From the daily life scenes, a clear arc emerges:
- **Initial Fear**: People are "unused to her" rather than afraid - they don't know how to interact
- **Growing Acceptance**: Team members find ways to care for her (Grimjaw's flask, Aldwin's food)
- **Full Integration**: "They didn't say we love you. They didn't need to. They had carried her through a day like a river carries a leaf"
- **The Revelation**: During the Corsic Drell incident, they finally understand what she truly is - not just a medium but a divine safeguard

## Psychological Profile
*   **Nireya Voss (The Bridge):** Nireya lives in a state of constant liminality, with one foot in the world of the living and one in the world of the dead. This has given her a unique, detached perspective on life and death. She is not morbid or frightening; she is serene. Her compassion is for the forgotten, and her mission is to ensure that every story gets an ending. She is likely the calmest person in any crisis, as the physical world's dangers often pale in comparison to the spiritual echoes she navigates daily.
