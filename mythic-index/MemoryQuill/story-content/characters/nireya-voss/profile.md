# Nireya Voss - Profile

## Basic Information
- **Full Name**: Nireya Voss
- **Aliases/Nicknames**: Death-Walker
- **Race**: Half-Elf Kalashtar
- **Class**: Spirit-Medium
- **Role in Story**: Spiritual specialist for the Last Light Company
- **First Appearance**: TBD
- **Status**: Active

## Physical Description
- **Height/Build**: Slender and poised, with a deliberate, graceful bearing.
- **Hair**: Long, dark hair that falls to her mid-back. Part of it is kept in a neat, thick braid, while the rest is left to hang loose, often seeming to merge with the shadows around her.
- **Eyes**: Her left eye is a warm, living brown. Her right eye is a luminous, multi-toned marvel, shifting between glowing chartreuse and a pale, spectral white, a clear indicator of her supernatural senses.
- **Distinguishing Features**: Nireya's appearance is a stark representation of her dual nature. The left side of her body is that of a living half-elf, with warm, sun-kissed skin that has a subtle silvery-blue undertone. The right side is a manifestation of her connection to the spirit world: her skin is a pale, spectral blue-gray, semi-translucent and marked with swirling quori glyphs and faint, shifting constellations that glow with a soft, internal light. Wisps of spirit-mist often curl around her form, converging at the split down her center.
- **Typical Clothing**: She wears layered robes that reflect her duality. The left side is made of a solid, warm brown earthly fabric with elegant, gold-embroidered star patterns. The right side is made of translucent, mist-like silks that seem to trail off into the surrounding air.
- **Body Language**: Calm, composed, and unnervingly still. She moves with a quiet purpose, and her gaze is often distant, as if she is perceiving things others cannot.

## Personality
- **Archetype**: The Medium/Bridge Between Worlds - A Living Covenant and Divine Safeguard
- **Temperament**: Measured and serene until souls are threatened, then becomes terrifyingly absolute
- **Positive Traits**: Compassionate toward the deceased, unafraid of darkness, dedicated to remembrance, fiercely protective of the natural order, surprisingly warm when comfortable
- **Negative Traits**: Potentially unsettling to others, inflexible about death rites, can become genuinely frightening when souls are desecrated
- **Moral Alignment**: Neutral Good - guardian of the natural cycle, but with an edge of divine judgment
- **Core Philosophy**: "Death is not the enemy - abandonment is" / "I do not barter with the dead for the convenience of the living"
- **Hidden Nature**: Not just a medium but a divine safeguard - when souls are weaponized or desecrated, she reveals herself as something far more powerful and terrifying than anyone suspected

## Skills & Abilities
- **Expertise**: 
  - Extracting information from the recently deceased
  - Navigating spectral landscapes
  - Mapping "death echoes" (as seen with the Wraithwood maps)
  - Spirit communication and interpretation
- **Kalashtar Abilities**:
  - Anchoring departing consciousness (as demonstrated saving Thorne)
  - Connection to a spirit guide that can stabilize fading life forces
- **Special Abilities**: 
  - Enhanced perception of the spirit realm
  - Ability to speak with and relay information from the dead
  - Creation of maps showing spiritual/death energy patterns
- **Time-of-Day Influence**:
  - During daylight: "Living" left side more prominent, more present in conversations
  - As darkness falls: "Death" side awakens, increasingly attuned to spiritual whispers
  - Between midnight and dawn: Peak spiritual connection when worlds overlap most strongly

## Personal Details
- **Habits**: 
  - Keeping watch during midnight to dawn hours when the worlds overlap most strongly
  - Carrying on quiet one-sided conversations with spirits only she can hear
  - Leaving tokens at recovery sites to remember the deceased
  - Moving between soul-lanterns at dawn like tending a forgotten shrine
  - Eating pickled quince with "guilty gusto" when alone
- **Hobbies**: 
  - Silver-Seaming: Repairing broken pottery with silver lacquer, finding peace in making things whole without hiding the cracks
  - Making flower crowns for distressed children from discarded stems
  - Cataloging sunrise/sunset times - the liminal moments when her nature is most balanced
- **Personal Quarters**: A quiet, isolated room in the Sanctuary terrace, with a single, high window that lets in the moonlight but not the direct sun. The room is starkly divided by a line of black sand on the floor. The "day" side has a simple wooden desk and chair. The "night" side is empty, save for shelves holding dozens of small, memorial tokens. This room is a physical representation of her liminal state. The air is unnaturally still and silent. She uses the desk on the "day" side for study and meditation. At night, she crosses the line of sand into the "night" side, where she communes with the spirits drawn to the tokens. She doesn't sleep in a traditional bed, but on a simple, padded mat placed directly on the line of sand, her body literally occupying the space between the two realms as she rests.
- **Likes**: Acknowledgment of spirits, respectful handling of the deceased, philosophical discussions, bitter tea (forest and smoke flavors), pickled quince
- **Dislikes**: Those who fear or vilify death, abandonment of the dead, witch hunters, forced necromancy, those who barter with the dead for convenience
- **Fears**: Becoming permanently stuck on the "death" side, failing to protect souls from desecration, the vulnerability after using her Pactform
- **Motivations**: Ensuring the dead are remembered, serving as a bridge between worlds, fulfilling her role as the gods' living covenant

## Combat & Tactics
- **Primary Tool**: Soul-staff topped with crystal skull that exists in both realms - channels and focuses her spiritual powers
- **Secondary Tools**: Soul-lanterns that contain and protect spirits, bone charms that resonate with the recently deceased
- **Armor**: Layered robes that shift between material and ethereal - no physical protection but spiritual warding
- **Fighting Style**: Living covenant - doesn't fight so much as impose the natural order, commanding spirits to return to their proper state
- **Signature Manifestation**: "Banshee Aspect/The Pactform" - when souls are desecrated, transforms into something divine and terrible
- **Combat Philosophy**: "I am not wrathful. I am inevitable. The personification of what happens when you desecrate the sacred."
- **Tactical Role**: Spiritual warfare specialist who handles undead, possessions, and soul-based threats
- **Trigger Points**: Souls being weaponized, forced necromancy, desecration of the dead
- **Key Combat Moments**: The Corsic Drell incident - when he shattered her soul-lantern and weaponized spirits, the Company saw her true nature for the first time

### The Banshee Aspect (When Unleashed)
- **Hair**: Billows skyward like spirit-smoke, silver and black strands separating into ghostly ribbons
- **Eyes**: Both glow - one searing white, the other an endless void
- **Form**: Body becomes silhouette of living shadow-script and blinding soulfire, bones glow like judgment
- **Presence**: Not possession but revelation of what she truly is - a safeguard, a boundary line between life and death
- **The Team's First Witness**: During the Corsic Drell fight, Thorne whispered "Gods preserve us" - their first understanding that she wasn't just a medium
- **Her Response**: "Not gods. Just oaths." - delivered exhausted but unshaken

## Psychological Response Matrix
- **In Crisis**: Becomes utterly still, then acts with divine certainty - "Return. This place is not your ending."
- **During Negotiation**: Listens for the subtle wrongness the newly dead leave when lies touch them (as with Marcus and the guild envoys)
- **Moral Dilemma**: Always chooses to preserve the natural cycle - "I do not barter with the dead for the convenience of the living"
- **Team Conflict**: Offers perspective from "the other side," mediates through shared mortality
- **Under Personal Attack**: Shows attacker their own spiritual wounds, makes them feel what they've inflicted
- **In Victory**: Performs rites for fallen enemies, ensures proper passage for all souls
- **Daily Life**: Moves between worlds constantly - pickled quince in morning, soul-guiding by night
- **When Souls Are Threatened**: Voice goes flat ("Those were names"), time seems to pause, transforms into the Pactform
- **After Using Pactform**: Becomes hypersensitive to all living sensations, emotionally raw, needs grounding through physical comforts (Aldwin's tea, food)

## Voice & Dialogue Patterns
- **Speech Style**: Measured, formal when channeling spirits, surprisingly dry humor when comfortable
- **Signature Phrases**: 
  - "The crossing here was clean" (reassuring mourners)
  - "Death is not the enemy - abandonment is"
  - "I do not barter with the dead for the convenience of the living"
  - "Those were names" (when souls are desecrated - voice goes flat, precedes transformation)
  - "Not gods. Just oaths" (after using divine power)
  - "Return. This place is not your ending" (commanding spirits)
- **Dual Voice**: When using full power, voice fractures with divine resonance - multiple tones at once
- **Example Dialogue**: "I guide them so they aren't used. I do not keep what isn't mine."
- **Emotional Tells**: Tattoos pulse brighter with spirit activity, right side grows more translucent when stressed, voice becomes distant when channeling
- **Comfort Mechanism**: Makes terrible jokes about death that only the team understands; dry comments about "weaponizing citrus"
- **Threat Response**: "Leave your coin on the table and I will walk away without shame. Push me again, and I will show you what it truly means to be heard by the dead."

## Notes
- Joined the Company after being rescued from a witch hunter prison
- The Company needed her maps of the Wraithwood's "death echoes" to track a missing caravan
- During escape, when Thorne took a crossbow bolt through his lung, she saved his life
- Exists in a liminal state between the world of the living and the dead
- When receiving information from the dead, her spirit-ink tattoos glow brighter
- When relaying spirit information, her voice becomes more distant and formal
- Personal philosophy: "Death is not the enemy - abandonment is"

### Public Perception
- Known as the "Death-Walker," who can speak to the recently deceased, a fact that is unsettling to some but comforting to others who believe she helps spirits find peace.
- Rumored to leave small tokens at tragedy sites to help the spirits rest, a strange but kind gesture.
- Her dual appearance, half-living and half-spectral, is a visible manifestation of her unique connection to the spirit world.
