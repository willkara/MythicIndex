appearance: "Lieutenant Tomaq is a towering, physically imposing orc whose sheer bulk often forces him to stoop and turn sideways to clear standard doorframes. Unusually for his kin, his skin is a distinct gray rather than the typical green. His rugged countenance is defined by a leather patch hiding his left eye and a broken left tusk that has been capped with silver. He maintains a strict professional military bearing, always seen in his City Watch uniform, which features Lieutenant chevrons attached with surprisingly precise, self-sewn stitches. Despite his massive frame, he moves with practiced efficiency, carrying a two-handed battle-axe that appears deceptively delicate in his enormous grip."
