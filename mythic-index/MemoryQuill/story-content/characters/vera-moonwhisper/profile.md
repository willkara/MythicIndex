## Personal Details
- **Habits**: Checking with her raven Echo before trusting human judgment
- **Hobbies**: Collecting tokens from animal allies
- **Personal Quarters**: A round, airy room at the top of one of the Bastion's smaller towers, with a large, covered balcony. The room is sparse, with a simple cot and a chest for her belongings. The floor is covered in a layer of clean sand and dried leaves, bringing the feeling of the forest indoors. This room is a nest, a place of observation. The true heart of the room is a massive, circular table in the center, upon which is a constantly evolving topographical map of the region, crafted from moss, twigs, carved wooden blocks, and polished stones. She uses it to visualize the hunt in three dimensions. The walls are covered in dozens of charcoal sketches of faces, but the most prominent is a series of portraits that attempt to age her lost brother—from a smiling child to a haunted-looking young man. She spends her nights on the balcony with her raven, Echo, listening to the sounds of the world and adding new details to her maps.

- **Companion Weapons**: Echo (raven) provides aerial reconnaissance and distraction, forms hunting partnerships with wolves when needed
- **Armor**: Layered leather and canvas designed for silent movement, weather resistance, and blending with natural environments
- **Fighting Style**: Versatile hunter - staff for close quarters defense, bow for ranged precision, seamless transitions between modes
- **Signature Move**: "Hunter's Dance" - fluid transition from staff strikes to bow shots in continuous motion

- **Tactical Role**: Forward scout who identifies threats, provides overwatch, and can hold defensive lines when needed

## Psychological Response Matrix
- **In Crisis**: Hyperfocuses on the immediate objective with trained precision, compartmentalizes personal concerns
- **During Negotiation**: Watches exits and reads micro-expressions, but now trusts team to handle social dynamics
- **Moral Dilemma**: Weighs decisions practically - brother's trail has been cold for years, current lives take precedence
- **Team Conflict**: Observes from distance but now offers quiet wisdom when asked rather than completely withdrawing
- **Under Personal Attack**: Notes it for later consideration but doesn't let it derail current mission
- **In Victory**: Takes moment to appreciate success before planning next steps - learned to value small victories

  - "Rescue operations have their own rhythm. Don't let the personal stakes rush your judgment." (professional wisdom)
- **Mature Perspective**: No longer speaks of brother constantly, mentions him only when relevant
- **Example Dialogue**: "Target went to ground two hours ago. Guards are nervous - Echo counted three on patrol, two more hidden. We can wait them out or find another way."
- **Emotional Tells**: Touches locket when thinking of brother but doesn't let it consume her, runs hand along Whisperwind when planning
