## Usage Guidelines

**When to Load:** Vera dialogue scenes, tracker/druid moments, combat situations, Echo references

**Scoring Your Vera:** Check words/line (6-16), verify exclamations (4-7/100), ensure ellipsis for exhausted moments, confirm "Echo sees" or "my brother" when appropriate

**Quick Test:** Is this clipped, intense, possibly trailing off? Is it tracker-precise or fiercely protective? If yes, likely authentic Vera.
