# Vera Moonwhisper - Voice Red Flags

**Purpose:** Common voice violations and antipatterns to avoid.

---

## Critical Red Flags

### ❌ Over-Wordy Formal Speech

**Problem:** Vera is clipped, intense, urgent. Wordiness completely breaks voice.

**Example Violation:** "Perhaps we should consider whether it might be advantageous to examine the northern area given potential tactical implications."

**Correct:** "North. Check it. Now."

---

### ❌ Using "Easy Now" With Humans

**Problem:** "Easy now" is Vera's animal-calming phrase (5 instances, animals only). Using with humans confuses it with Aldwin's humancare approach.

**Example Violation:** "Easy now, easy. You're going to be okay."

**Why Wrong:** That's Aldwin's context. Vera says it to scared horses/wolves, not people.

**Correct:** For humans: "You're safe. We've got this." Different phrasing entirely.

---

### ❌ Missing Winter/Cold Imagery

**Problem:** Winter/cold is Vera's trauma signature (snow, ice, frost, blizzard, frozen).

**Violation:** Vera scenes with zero cold/winter references.

**Correction:** Add winter language naturally when describing environments or emotional states.

---

### ❌ Missing Ellipsis in Vulnerable/Exhausted Moments

**Problem:** Ellipsis (3.4 per 100 words) is signature for vulnerable Vera. Removing it loses character distinctiveness.

**Violation:** Extended vulnerable dialogue with zero ellipsis.

**Correction:** Insert ellipsis to show pauses, trailing thoughts: "I've been looking... seven years... and nothing..."

---

### ❌ Long Explanations in Combat

**Problem:** Combat Vera is ultra-short (6.2 words/line, 42% fragments). Long explanations violate voice.

**Example Violation:** A combat scene where Vera gives 20+ word tactical explanations.

**Correct:** "INCOMING! EASTERN APPROACH! All positions!" (9 words, fragments, urgency)

---

## Moderate Red Flags

### ⚠️ No Exclamations in Combat Contexts

**Problem:** Combat Vera should have 8-10 exclamations per 100 words.

**Violation:** Combat scene with under 5 exclamations.

**Correction:** Add exclamation points to combat orders and warnings.

---

### ⚠️ Missing "Echo Sees" Frame

**Problem:** "Echo sees..." is absolutely signature phrase (ONLY Vera uses this).

**Violation:** Major Vera scene involving Echo's perception without "Echo sees" introduction.

**Correction:** Use frame: "Echo sees... [animal perception translated to language]"

---

### ⚠️ Missing "My Brother" Possessive Reference

**Problem:** "My brother" appears 8 times in analysis. Not "sibling," always possessive "my."

**Violation:** Character references to lost brother without possessive "my."

**Correction:** Always "my brother," not variations.

---

### ⚠️ Contractions Over 25% in Combat

**Problem:** Combat Vera drops to 8% contractions (formality increases under stress).

**Violation:** Combat scene with 25%+ contractions.

**Correction:** Minimize contractions in combat: "is" not "it's," "are" not "they're."
