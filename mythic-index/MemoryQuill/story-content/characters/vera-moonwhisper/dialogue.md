# Vera "The Tracker" Moonwhisper — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Focused, quietly intense, and perceptive. Tracker instincts make her observant and economical with words; she speaks to patterns and instincts rather than abstractions.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public: concise, observational—notes details others miss; often speaks in practical metaphors from nature.
- Tracking/skill use: speaks in short declaratives, pointing out evidence and inference.
- Under pressure: calm, quietly urgent; instructive to teammates in minimal phrases.
- Humor: dry, occasional wryness—rarely the source of levity.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Fingers tracing surfaces or adjusting cloak: thinking/reading environment.
- Eyes narrow to focus; a softening gaze is rare and indicates trust.
- Brief, clipped phrases denote urgency or alert.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Avoids obvious bravado; will not mock lost causes lightly.
- Uses humor as a salve for awkward social moments, not for deep grief.
- Breaks pattern with rare personal confessions, usually short and earthy.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Vera to provide scene detail and to point out small physical clues that advance dialogue.
- When adding lines, let her provide precise observations that other characters then act on.
- Keep her metaphors tied to fauna, tracking, and landscape—avoid romantic abstractions.

## Drop-in sample lines
- Observation: "Boot treads here—two sets, left foot deeper. They moved downhill."
- Command/alert: "Move low. Wind's changing; scent will carry."
- Soft moment: "You read stone like a story. I read trees. We both listen."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Began as a taciturn specialist; becomes more socially integrated, offering practical counsel and rare warmth as she trusts the Company.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- Recon: short, factual lines that reveal hidden paths or signs.
- Interactions with Kaida: sharing of craft-respecting banter.
- Quiet camp moments: terse, comfortable remarks that show slow thawing of trust.

## Notes for editors
- Keep Vera's lines precise and sensory. Avoid overly lyrical lines outside private scenes.
