appearance: "Vera Moonwhisper is a lean half-elf woman with a calm, determined demeanor, appearing to be in her late twenties or early thirties. Her long, rich dark brown hair is pulled back into a thick, practical braid over her right shoulder. Her striking hazel eyes gaze intently forward from beneath a dark green hooded cloak, which is intricately embroidered with subtle hare and fox motifs. Faint, reddish, vein-like scars trace across her right cheek, a visible mark of past trauma. She wears earth-toned, layered leather armor embossed with leaf designs and a central paw print emblem, accented by a round bronze pendant depicting an animal's face. In her left hand, she grips a polished wooden staff carved with entwining green vines, while her large black raven companion, Echo, perches alertly on her shoulder."
