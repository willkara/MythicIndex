## Psychological Profile
*   **Vera Moonwhisper (The Seeker):** Vera's psychology is a pendulum swinging between obsessive focus and methodical patience. The search for her brother has defined her entire life, making her wary of people and more comfortable with the honesty of animals. Veyra's influence has tempered her desperation into a professional skill, but the obsessive fire is still there. She fears returning to that desperate state, and her trust, once given, is absolute and fierce.
