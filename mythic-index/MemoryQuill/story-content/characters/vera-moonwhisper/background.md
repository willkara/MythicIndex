## History
- **Childhood**: 
  - *Key Events*: The kidnapping of her younger brother, Liam, by a shadowy slaver ring known as the "Silent Hand."
  - *Formative Experiences*: As the older sibling, Vera was supposed to be watching Liam while they were playing in the woods just outside their village. She was distracted for a single, crucial moment by a rare bird, and when she looked back, he was gone. There was no sound, no struggle, just an eerie silence. This personal, momentary lapse is the source of her deep, gnawing guilt.
  
- **Education/Training**: 
  - *Institutions*: Self-taught in the harsh classroom of the wilderness.
  - *Mentors*: The animals of the forest became her teachers when the people of her village failed her.
  - *Areas of Study*: Tracking, wilderness survival, animal communication, and the art of becoming unseen.
  
- **Adolescence/Young Adulthood**:
  - *Key Events*: After the local authorities gave up their search for Liam, Vera began her own. She spent years in a desperate, obsessive search, honing her skills but losing her connection to humanity.
  - *Relationships*: She formed practical, non-magical partnerships with animals, finding them more reliable than people.
  - *Choices & Consequences*: She chose a life of isolation and single-minded pursuit, sacrificing a normal existence for her all-consuming mission.
  
- **Major Life Events**:
  - *Event 1*: The Kidnapping of Liam - The traumatic event that set her life's course.
  - *Event 2*: The Meeting with Echo - Years into her search, at her absolute lowest point, she collapsed in the snow, ready to give up. A lone, scrappy raven, also a survivor, landed nearby and simply... stayed. Its persistent, silent presence became her anchor, a reflection of her own stubborn will to live. She named him "Echo," and in emulating his methodical survival, she began to transform her raw obsession into a true skill.
  - *Event 3*: The Rescue by Veyra - While tracking a false lead, she was caught in a blizzard and found, near death, by Veyra and the nascent Last Light Company.
  - *Event 4*: The Turning Point - Veyra's words, "Hope is a tool. Learn to use it better," gave Vera the final piece of the puzzle she needed to channel her grief and guilt into a focused, professional purpose.
  - *Event 5*: The "Silent Hand" Mission - Vera's relentless research uncovered a credible lead on the "Silent Hand," the very slaver ring that took her brother. The mission to rescue a group of children from a fortified compound became deeply personal, the first real hope she'd had in years. Her personal stake in the mission was the direct catalyst for the Company hiring Korrath Threnx and Cidrella Vexweld.

## Personal Details
- **How She Relaxes**: She finds calm in the quiet observation of her animal allies, particularly Echo. She will spend hours on the balcony of her Aerie, simply watching him preen his feathers or observing the subtle interactions of the birds in the courtyard below. It's a silent, comfortable form of communication that requires no words and carries no risk of misunderstanding.
- **Favorite Meal**: Smoked river trout with wild berries and nuts. It's the ultimate survivalist's meal—food she can easily forage and prepare herself in the wild. It's not just a preference; it's a taste of self-reliance and competence, a reminder of the skills that have kept her alive for years.
- **Favorite Drink**: Pine-needle tonic mixed with glacier melt and a squeeze of wild citrus. She bottles it for long patrols, the resinous bite keeping her senses sharp through sleepless nights.
- **A Prized Possession**: She carries a small, smooth river stone in her pocket. It was the last thing her brother, Liam, gave her, found on the bank of the stream where they were playing just before he was taken. She will often turn it over and over in her hand, the cool, smooth surface a tangible link to her past and the driving force of her mission.
- **Hobby**: **Scrimshaw and Bone Carving.** During her long, solitary years in the wilderness, Vera learned to pass the quiet hours by carving intricate designs into animal bones and teeth she found naturally. Her carvings are not morbid, but beautiful and detailed depictions of the animals and landscapes she has seen. It's a quiet, patient art form that requires the same focus and steady hand as tracking, and it's a way for her to honor the natural world she is so deeply connected to.
