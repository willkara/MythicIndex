appearance: "Borin Stonehand is a stout, sturdy dwarf whose middle-aged face bears the weathered lines of experience alongside a warm, ruddy complexion. His voluminous auburn hair and beard dominate his appearance, with the beard expertly plaited into a thick central braid that reaches his chest. His deep brown eyes crinkle with a jovial, steadfast expression, reflecting his role as a moral compass. He is clothed in heavy, dark brown clerical vestments made of textured wool, detailed with intricate knotwork embroidery on the cuffs and across his midsection. In his right hand, he firmly grasps a war-hammer with a dark iron head and wooden haft, while his left arm cradles a massive, leather-bound holy book embellished with gold scrollwork and a prominent silver and gold emblem of interlocking rings."
