## Significance
Borin Stonehand served as the Gilded Compass's healer and moral guide, a devout cleric of Berronar Truesilver (dwarven goddess of hearth and healing).

- Name inscribed in the Hall of Remembrance
- His protective instinct echoes in the Company's mission
- Represents the divine protection that failed but inspired future dedication
