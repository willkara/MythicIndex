# Borin Stonehand - Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: A large dwarven city, likely Citadel Adbar or a similar stronghold.
- **Social Class**: Respected clerical class.
- **Cultural Background**: Devout follower of the dwarven pantheon, specifically Berronar Truesilver, the goddess of hearth, home, and healing.

## Family
- **Spouse**: Helga, a master brewer.
- **Children**: Three daughters.
- **Family Dynamics**: A loving and proud husband and father, he often spoke of his family with great affection. His role as a protector was deeply rooted in his love for them.

## History
- **Professional Career**: A cleric of Berronar Truesilver who chose to bring his goddess's protection and healing to the wider world rather than remain in a temple. He served as the cleric and moral compass for the Gilded Compass adventuring party.

## Personal Details
- **A Cherished Possession**: His most prized personal item was a beautifully crafted silver-banded drinking horn, a gift from his wife, Helga. He would often boast that no ale ever tasted as good as his wife's, especially when drunk from that horn.
- **How He Relaxed**: He was a surprisingly nimble dancer. On quiet nights in taverns, after a successful adventure, he could be coaxed into performing a traditional, stomping dwarven jig. His infectious, booming laughter during these moments was a source of immense joy and morale for the entire party.
- **Favorite Meal**: A massive "Forge-Tender's Pie," a savory pastry crust filled with slow-cooked meats, root vegetables, and a thick, ale-based gravy. It's a communal, celebratory meal, meant to be shared, which perfectly suited his role as the heart of the party.
- **Favorite Drink**: Helga's hearthfire ale—a malt rich brew steeped with juniper and a hint of caramelized stonefruit. He insisted it tasted best after being warmed between his palms and shared in a circle of friends.
