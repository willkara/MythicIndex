appearance: "Based on the profile provided, Gareth Stormcrow is a young human man possessing a lean, wiry build that hints at the untamed energy coiled within him. His most striking feature is his pair of \"knowing\" eyes—perhaps a striking amber or deep forest green—which hold a depth of understanding and past trauma often incongruous with his youthful face. His overall appearance is somewhat unkempt, with hair likely tousled by the elements, reflecting his close connection to the wild and his frequent wolf transformations. He dresses practically for life outdoors, favoring worn leathers, furs, and sturdy natural fabrics in muted earth tones that allow for easy movement. Though young, he carries himself with a quiet, settled demeanor, and closer inspection might reveal faint, silvery scars on his hands or neck—lingering reminders of the shapeshifting mistakes made in his own youth."
