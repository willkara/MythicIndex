## Notes

**Tragic Role**: Martha Hearthwarm represents one of the Silent Hand's cruelest manipulations. She is a genuinely kind person who believes she is working in a legitimate magical research facility with a student apprentice program. She takes pride in preparing nutritious meals for "the young folks" and genuinely cares about their well-being.

**Unwitting Complicity**: When speaking with Brother Aldwin at the gala, she proudly described preparing meals for the apprentices but noted they "seem so tired lately." Dr. Mourngrave had told her it was due to "the intensive study schedule." In reality, Martha is feeding imprisoned children who are being prepared for trafficking.

**The Prisoner's Diet**: Aldwin immediately recognized the diet she described as "nutrient-rich, calorie-dense meals" - the diet of prisoners being kept healthy for transport, not students. This realization filled him with sorrow, as he understood Martha had no idea she was complicit in the trafficking operation.

**Manipulation by Mourngrave**: Dr. Mourngrave has carefully constructed a false reality for Martha, explaining away warning signs (exhausted children, restricted access, high security) as normal aspects of an intensive academic program. Martha trusts these explanations completely.

**Moral Tragedy**: Martha will likely be devastated when she learns the truth about what she's been unwittingly supporting. She represents the human cost of the Silent Hand's deceptions - good people manipulated into serving evil purposes.
