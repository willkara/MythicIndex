appearance: "Martha Hearthwarm is a stout, matronly human woman who appears elderly, her face defined by deep wrinkles that crinkle around her warm, dark eyes. Her grey and white hair is pulled back practically from her face, framing a wide, beaming expression and cheeks flushed with exertion. She is dressed for heavy labor in a textured brown work shirt with rolled sleeves beneath a heavily stained, off-white canvas apron. Her sturdy hands, coated in food residue, are actively mixing green vegetables in a large wooden bowl amidst other rustic pots and pans. Despite the dim, grimy kitchen environment, she projects an aura of overwhelming warmth and enthusiastic, maternal pride in her culinary work."
