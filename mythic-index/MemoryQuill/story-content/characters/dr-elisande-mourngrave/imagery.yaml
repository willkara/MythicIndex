appearance: "This mature human woman stands with a commanding, regal bearing, her posture upright and severe. Her dark brown hair is swept tightly back from her face into an intricate braided bun, highlighting her fair complexion and the fine lines of experience around her eyes and mouth. Her intense blue-grey eyes gaze fixedly toward something unseen, reflecting a stern and resolute intellect. She is clad in a rich, deep royal blue velvet robe that features vertical panels of complex silver runic embroidery down the chest and front. Over the robe, she wears aged bronze pauldrons and a matching thick belt with a large circular buckle, while a heavy burgundy cloak is draped over her shoulders. Small gold drop earrings catch the light, adding the final touch to a figure who radiates authority and arcane power, reflected in the glass panel beside her that houses swirling magical energies."
