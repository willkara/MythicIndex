style_overrides:
  magic_level: "subtle-practical"
  fantasy_grounding:
    - "clinical magic as infrastructure: rune-lamp grids, ward-censers, threshold sigils (functional, not flashy)"
    - "glassware + specimen ledgers with alchemical-ink stamps and anti-tamper seals"
  faction_or_guild_marks:
    - "Veridian crest on a brooch, seal ring, or stamped folio clasp (polished, controlled)"
  signature_props:
    - "gloved hands with rune-inlaid scalpel / instruments (precision wards, no sci-fi)"
    - "vial with muted luminescence (subtle, contained, not neon)"
  avoid:
    - "modern lab aesthetics (stainless steel, computers, fluorescent panels, sci-fi corridors)"
    - "overt spellcasting VFX; menace should be social/clinical, not fireworks"
