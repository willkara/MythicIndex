appearance: "Lyra Kestrel is a tiefling with a lean, athletic build and a composed, calculating gaze suggesting she is in her mid-to-late 20s. Her striking appearance is defined by deep plum-colored skin, intense golden-amber eyes, and dark, textured horns that sweep elegantly back from her temples. Her auburn hair is pulled tightly away from her face, secured by a visible ornate gold hairpin, though a few loose strands escape to frame her features. She wears a fitted, layered leather jacket combining dark charcoal and reddish-brown panels, fastened with brass buttons and a buckled waist belt. Leather strapping over her left shoulder secures the hilts of twin blades strapped to her back, and faint, swirling wisps of purple magical energy dance around her neck and clavicle area, hinting at her arcane abilities."
