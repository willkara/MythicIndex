## Proposed Image Ideas

### 1. Voice Mimicry in Action

- **Pose/Action:** Speaking, one hand raised slightly, wisps of darker purple manifesting around her neck
- **Setting:** Dim interior, target in soft focus
- **Mood:** Supernatural talent made visible, the spy's most dangerous weapon
- **Tags:** magic, signature-ability, atmospheric, mysterious

### 2. Release and Chorus

- **Setting:** Dark alley or infiltration scene
- **Mood:** Lethal grace, the weapon behind the smile
- **Tags:** combat, weapons, action-ready, dangerous

### 3. The Perfect Disguise
**Scene:** Lyra transformed into a completely different persona - perhaps the "bored noblewoman" or "deferential servant" - demonstrating her chameleonic ability.
- **Pose/Action:** Different posture than her default, playing a role convincingly
- **Setting:** Noble gathering or servant's corridor
- **Mood:** The constructed persona, identity as tool
- **Tags:** disguise, social-engineering, transformation, subtle

### 4. Outmaneuvering Crowsight

- **Pose/Action:** Slight smile, wine glass in hand, maintaining perfect composure
- **Setting:** Gala setting, Crowsight flustered in background

### 5. Academy Training
**Scene:** Flashback or implied image of Lyra in her Royal Intelligence Academy days, the prodigy being forged.

- **Setting:** Training facility, professional environment
- **Mood:** Origins of the operative, before disillusionment
- **Tags:** backstory, training, younger, origins

### 6. The Real Lyra
**Scene:** A rare unguarded moment - Lyra alone, mask dropped, the person beneath all the personas.
- **Pose/Action:** Sitting alone, perhaps removing hairpin-blade, expression thoughtful or weary
- **Setting:** Private quarters, spartan and efficient
- **Mood:** Vulnerability hidden from everyone, the cost of being no one
- **Tags:** intimate, vulnerable, character-depth, private
