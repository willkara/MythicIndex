# Lyra Kestrel - Dialogue & Mannerisms

## Speech Patterns
- **Vocabulary Level**: Extensive and precise. She code-switches effortlessly, from academic language to underworld slang to noble court flattery.
- **Accent/Dialect**: Her natural accent is non-existent, a perfectly neutral tone cultivated by the Academy. She adopts and discards accents as easily as cloaks.
- **Formal/Informal**: Her default is a detached, professional formality, but she uses informalities (like "darling" or "sweetheart") as a form of condescension or control.
- **Unique Phrases**: "A predictable variable," "The math doesn't support that," "Let's not be sentimental."

## Physical Mannerisms
- **Thinking Poses**: A slight, almost imperceptible tilt of the head, as if listening to a sound no one else can hear. She might subtly mirror the posture of the person she's analyzing.
- **Social Behaviors**: Immaculate control. Her movements are efficient and deliberate. Her flirtations are a performance—a light touch on an arm, a conspiratorial lean-in—all designed to disarm and extract.
- **Habits**: Obsessive, precise organization of her tools. When idle, her fingers might trace the outline of a hidden blade or practice a subtle gesture from a somatic spell. Often adjusts the ornate hairpin securing her auburn bun, a subtle check that her concealed blade is accessible.
- **Voice Mimicry Tell**: When using her powers, faint flowing wisps of darker purple or shadow manifest around her neck and throat, dancing across her plum skin like visible sound waves or smoke. The effect intensifies with the complexity of the mimicry—simple voices produce subtle wisps, while perfect replications create more dramatic shadowy tendrils.

## Emotional Responses
- **Under Stress**: Becomes unnaturally calm. Her voice loses all inflection, becoming flat and clinical as she assesses variables and calculates probabilities.
- **When Lying**: She doesn't lie; she performs. Her body language, voice, and emotional tells are all part of the character she is playing. The only way to know is to spot a flaw in the performance.
- **When Confident**: A small, knowing smirk plays on her lips. Her movements become more fluid, almost like a dance.
- **In Conflict**: She uses psychological warfare. Her voice becomes a weapon, mimicking trusted allies to give false orders or whispering a target's deepest fears in their own voice.

## Communication Style
- **Direct/Indirect**: Indirect by default. She prefers to manipulate a situation so that others arrive at the conclusion she wants. In a crisis, however, she becomes brutally direct.
- **Humor Style**: Dry, cynical, and often dark. She finds humor in the absurdity of situations and the predictability of people's flaws.
- **Persuasion Techniques**: A master of manipulation. She uses a combination of charm, logic, veiled threats, and her mimicry skills to achieve her objectives.

## Voice Qualities
- **Pitch/Timbre**: Her natural voice is a clear, level alto, but this is rarely heard. Her true talent is her ability to replicate the pitch, timbre, and cadence of any voice she hears—a gift enhanced by her tiefling heritage's subtle infernal magic.
- **Emotional Tells in Voice**: Her natural voice is almost devoid of emotional tells. Emotion in her voice is a conscious choice, a tool to be used.
- **Visual Manifestation**: The shadowy wisps around her throat serve as an involuntary tell when she's using her mimicry powers, though she's learned to minimize them with practice. Observant individuals might notice the effect even when she's trying to conceal it.

## Dialogue Examples
### Casual (Performance) Conversation
"Lord Harrington, you are too kind. But a woman of my... particular talents learns to appreciate the finer points of security architecture. Your vault is simply exquisite. Tell me, is that a dual-tumbler system from the workshops of Nimblefingers? Fascinating."

### Under Pressure (Issuing Orders)
(In the voice of a guard captain) "All units, sector four is a false alarm. The disturbance is in sector seven. Converge there immediately. Acknowledge."
(To the team, in her own voice) "That gives us a ninety-second window. Move."

### Emotional (A Rare Glimpse)
"Trust? Trust is a variable you can't control. It's a weakness you introduce into an otherwise perfect plan. I had a crew once. We trusted each other. And now... I have a very well-organized set of lockpicks."
