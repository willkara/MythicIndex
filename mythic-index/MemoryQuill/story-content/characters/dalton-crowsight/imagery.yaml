appearance: "Sergeant Dalton Crowsight is a human male in his mid-30s possessing a lean, athletic build that he carries with unsettling, predatory precision. His most arresting feature is his pair of cold, calculating eyes that constantly scan his surroundings, seemingly dissecting the intentions of those around him. He maintains a severely groomed, professional appearance, with hair kept neatly in check to match his rigid demeanor. Crowsight is typically encountered in the sharply tailored, dark uniform of a Veridian Agronomics security officer, though he wears fine doublets with equal stiffness during formal undercover work. Regardless of his attire, his watchful posture and deliberate movements project an intimidating aura of suspicion and control."
