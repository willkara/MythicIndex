## Notes

**Role in Chapter 35**: Sergeant Crowsight serves as Veridian Agronomics' internal security specialist, working alongside Captain Thale Greycloak. His primary function appears to be counter-intelligence and interrogation. During the Spring Innovation Gala, he attempted to expose Lyra Kestrel's false identity as "Dr. Blackwood" by fabricating a story about a fictional cousin at Baldur's Gate's Arcane Collegium.

**Interrogation Style**: Uses fabricated personal connections to test the veracity of cover stories. Creates plausible but false details to see if targets will claim knowledge they shouldn't have. His approach is predatory - he enjoys the hunt and the reveal.

**Relationship to Silent Hand**: As a Veridian security officer, he is likely aware of or complicit in the organization's trafficking operations. His role suggests he handles internal security threats and screens visitors for potential infiltrators.

**Confrontation with Lyra**: His attempt to expose Lyra failed spectacularly when she not only deflected his fabricated story but built a more credible counter-fiction that left him flustered and outmaneuvered. This rare defeat seemed to unsettle him, suggesting he's not accustomed to being beaten at his own game.
