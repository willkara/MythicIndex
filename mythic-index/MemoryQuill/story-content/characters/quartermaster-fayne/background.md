# Quartermaster Fayne – Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: Waterdeep's Trades Ward
- **Birth Name**: Faynara (abandoned when they chose their own identity)
- **Social Class**: Lower middle class
- **Cultural Background**: Rock Gnome; raised in a temple of Gond, the god of craft, which instilled a deep appreciation for systems, history, and artistry
- **Gender Journey**: Assigned female at birth, began questioning rigid categories early - found freedom in Gond's teaching that "all things can be reshaped and remade"

## Family
- **Family Dynamics**: An orphan raised by the priests and artisans of the Gondian temple. Fayne's family is the vast network of correspondents, fellow guild members, and academics with whom they share knowledge.

## History
- **Childhood**: 
  - Grew up surrounded by invention and meticulous record-keeping in Gond's temple
  - Showed early aptitude for spotting patterns others missed - could predict which archive shelves would collapse weeks before they did
  - First realized their gender fluidity while cataloguing identity documents - saw how names and categories could change, be chosen, be remade
  - Began experimenting with different names and presentations in the safety of the temple archives

- **Adolescence & Self-Discovery**:
  - Chose the name "Fayne" at age 23 - a deliberate truncation and transformation of their birth name
  - Learned forgery initially to alter their own documents, discovering a talent for replicating any script
  - The temple priests, following Gond's philosophy of transformation and craft, supported their journey
  - Developed their pattern-recognition into an almost supernatural ability - could track missing books through the library by disruption patterns in dust

- **Motivation for Joining the Watch**: 
  - A passion for systems and the power of documentation
  - The City Watch offered a chance to remake themselves officially - new papers, new identity, recognized by the city
  - For Fayne, the logistical operation of the Watch is a fascinatingly complex pattern to understand and perfect
  - Also saw it as an opportunity to help others who needed documentation "adjusted" for their safety

- **Pattern Recognition Evolution**:
  - What started as organizing archives became an ability to see connections others couldn't
  - Can track people not through footprints but through patterns - where they buy supplies, how they disrupt normal flows, what they change
  - This makes them an exceptional investigator despite no formal training

- **Personal Practices**:
  - Maintains three different sets of documentation with subtle variations on their gender markers
  - Creates artistic "pattern maps" that document the flow of people and supplies through the city
  - Their quarters are organized in a system only they understand - appears chaotic but every item's position tells a story

## Personal Details
- **Favorite Meal**: Layered root-vegetable gratin with pockets of sharp goat cheese and crushed pistachio. They catalog each bake in a ledger, adjusting spices like an experiment until the pattern of flavors feels "solved."
- **Favorite Drink**: Chilled copper cup of cardamom-vanilla caf sweetened with condensed milk. They sip it through a brass straw while annotating supply manifests deep into the night.
