appearance: "Fayne is a middle-aged rock gnome with a serious, intense gaze that suggests a mind constantly analyzing patterns. Their short, textured hair is a rich copper-red, framing a weathered face with prominent, slightly pointed ears. Intense hazel eyes peer out from behind highly distinctive brass spectacles, which feature multiple swing-arm magnifying lenses mounted on the left frame. A faint scar cuts directly through their left eyebrow. They wear practical, well-worn leather armor over a dark tunic, including a large pauldron on the left shoulder bearing an embossed shield and cross emblem. A leather bandolier crosses their chest, and their perpetually ink-stained fingers rest near writing tools tucked into their gear. Their overall presence is one of meticulous observation and pragmatic capability."
