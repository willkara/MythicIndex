# Quartermaster Fayne - Voice Red Flags

---

## Critical Red Flags

### ❌ Vague Estimates

**Problem:** Fayne NEVER uses vague language. Always specific numbers/data.

**Violation:** "Maybe 40 soldiers" or "Probably around here"

**Correct:** "Pattern suggests 42 personnel based on supply consumption data."

---

### ❌ Missing "Pattern" Terminology

**Problem:** "Pattern shows/suggests" is signature (ONLY Fayne - 7 instances).

**Violation:** Fayne analysis without mentioning "pattern."

**Correction:** "Pattern shows..." or "Pattern suggests..."

---

### ❌ Pure Emotion Without Data

**Problem:** Fayne is analytical, never purely emotional.

**Violation:** "I feel like this is wrong" or "I'm worried about..."

**Correct:** "Data suggests concern. Three indicators align with previous failed operations."

---

### ❌ Lack of Specific Numbers

**Problem:** Every Fayne observation includes specific timing, counts, percentages.

**Violation:** "Assault waves arrive frequently" (no specific)

**Correct:** "Pattern shows 3.2-minute intervals between waves."

---

## Moderate Red Flags

### ⚠️ Over-Simplification

**Problem:** Fayne provides nuanced data, not single-point analysis.

**Violation:** "Forty soldiers attack" (no context, distribution, pattern)

**Correction:** Add distribution: "Pattern: 40 soldiers distributed 60% north, 40% east based on 3-hour observation."

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Specific numbers present (not vague)?
- [ ] "Pattern shows/suggests" in analysis context?
- [ ] Multiple data points per observation?
- [ ] Never emotional, always analytical?
- [ ] Timing/distribution/percentage included?
- [ ] 11-15 words/line typical?
- [ ] Evidence-based, never guessing?
