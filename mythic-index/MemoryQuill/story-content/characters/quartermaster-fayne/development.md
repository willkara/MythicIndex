# Quartermaster Fayne – Character Development

## Personality Core
- **Defining Traits**: Meticulous, pattern-obsessed, creative, transformative, precisely chaotic
- **Core Values**: The power of documentation to shape reality, preservation of truth, the beauty of patterns, the right to self-definition
- **Motivations**: To document history as it happens, to help others remake themselves through documentation, to find the patterns that predict the future
- **Fears**: Being erased from history, loss of knowledge, chaos without pattern, being trapped in one identity
- **Internal Conflicts**: 
  - The desire for neat systems versus chaotic reality of rescue work
  - Documenting truth versus sometimes needing to forge better realities
  - Being visible as themselves versus old habits of hiding

## Gender Identity & Documentation Philosophy
- **Documentation as Identity**: Understands deeply that "you are what the papers say you are" - uses this power to help others
- **Fluidity in Record-Keeping**: Maintains different versions of records that capture different aspects of truth
- **The Power of Names**: Believes names are chosen, not given - documents people as they choose to be known
- **Living Archive**: Sees themselves as a living document, constantly being revised and updated
- **Helping Others Transform**: Uses forgery skills to help others escape dangerous pasts or claim new futures

## Character Arc
- **Starting Point**: A highly competent but detached Quartermaster, more interested in the systems of the Watch than its day-to-day drama.
- **Catalyst Events**: Witnessing the birth of a living legend in Undershade Canyon.
- **Current State**: The official (and self-appointed) archivist and logistician of the Last Light Company, finding immense satisfaction in building its operational and symbolic foundations from scratch.
- **Intended Destination**: To become the Company's historian and master of logistics, the keeper of its story and the architect of its efficiency.
