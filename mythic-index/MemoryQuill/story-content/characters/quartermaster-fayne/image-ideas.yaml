  name: Quartermaster Fayne
  summary: '47-year-old rock gnome artificer and Company Quartermaster. Founding patrol member. Gender-fluid/non-binary (they/them). Auburn hair, hazel eyes, ink-stained fingers, custom spectacles with multiple swing-arm lenses. Pattern-recognition specialist who sees connections others miss.
