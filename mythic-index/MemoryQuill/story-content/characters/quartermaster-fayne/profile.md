## Visual Summary
Fayne is a rock gnome of androgynous appearance with short auburn hair and observant hazel eyes. They are rarely seen without their custom-made spectacles, which feature multiple swing-arm lenses. Their fingers are perpetually ink-stained, and they wear a practical, modified City Guard uniform along with a leather bandolier for their various tools.

## Significance
Quartermaster Fayne represents the logistical and administrative backbone of what will become the Last Light Company. Their heraldry sketches foreshadow the Company's official formation and visual identity.

## Key Actions
- Collected relics from the fallen (shield boss, holy symbol)
- Created the L, E, B, I memorial stones
- Sketched heraldry designs (lantern + shield boss)
- Suggested making the lantern gold "harder to tarnish"
- Founding Patrol: Member of Captain Thorne Brightward's original patrol that discovered Veyra at Undershade Canyon; counted among the Last Light Company's founding patrol (evidence: ch01, core/02-storyJournal.md).
- Played a key role in the Stonebridge investigation, identifying the suspicious warehouse and attempting to crack a safe (Chapter 13).

## Personality Traits
- Thoughtful and creative
- Detail-oriented
- Respectful of the fallen
- Forward-thinking (already planning Company heraldry)
- Artistic inclinations
- Pragmatic
- Possesses strong investigative instincts

## Skills & Abilities
- **Expertise**: Logistics, Administration, Sketching/Drafting, Document Forgery
- **Pattern Recognition**: Unconscious ability to spot patterns in seemingly random data - makes them an exceptional tracker despite no formal training
- **Tracking Through Patterns**: Can follow targets by recognizing disruptions in environmental patterns, behavioral tendencies, supply usage
- **Special Skills**: 
  - Expert forgery (can replicate any handwriting after brief study)
  - Basic lockpicking (still learning complex mechanisms)
  - Eidetic memory for anything they've documented
  - Can calculate supply needs weeks in advance through pattern analysis
  - Spots inconsistencies in stories, movements, or documents instantly

## Voice & Dialogue Patterns
- **Speech Style**: Precise, often speaks in lists or categories, corrects imprecise language
- **Voice Modulation**: Subtly shifts tone based on daily gender expression - some days lower, some days higher, always deliberate
- **Verbal Tics**: 
  - "Note for the record..." when documenting something important
  - "Pattern suggests..." when sharing their tracking insights
  - "Technically speaking..." when correcting inaccuracies
  - Counts things aloud when nervous
- **Signature Phrases**:
  - "Everything has a pattern if you look long enough"
  - "Documents don't lie, but they can be convinced to bend the truth"
  - "I'm not predicting the future, I'm just reading the patterns"
  - "You are what the papers say you are"

## Daily Habits & Quirks
- **Morning Ritual**: Updates three different ledgers while the tea steeps - supply levels, personnel status, pattern observations
- **Counting Compulsion**: Counts everything - steps, heartbeats, words in conversations
- **Organization System**: Appears chaotic to others but every item's position tells part of a larger pattern
- **Gender Expression Markers**: Small daily choices - a pin, a way of tying their belt, stance width - that signal their current identity
- **Pattern Mapping**: Creates artistic representations of the patterns they see - beautiful but incomprehensible to others
- **Documentation Obsession**: Records EVERYTHING, even meals and weather patterns

## Hidden Depths
- **The Prophecy Pattern**: Beginning to see larger patterns that suggest future events - unsure if it's skill or something more
- **Identity Forge**: Maintains a secret workshop where they help others create new identities when needed
- **The Master Pattern**: Believes there's an underlying pattern to everything - seeking it in the Company's formation
- **Memory Palace**: Their eidetic memory is organized as a vast library where they can walk through memories like archives

## Future Role
Expected to become the Company's logistics lead and official co-historian with Marcus, handling supplies, heraldry, and documentation. Their pattern recognition makes them invaluable for predicting enemy movements and supply needs.
