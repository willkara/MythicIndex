## Proposed Image Ideas

### 1. Pattern Recognition in Action
**Scene:** Fayne surrounded by seemingly random data - documents, maps, supply lists - eyes unfocused as they perceive the underlying pattern.
- **Pose/Action:** Head tilted, spectacle lenses swung into position, finger tracing invisible connections
- **Setting:** Quartermaster's workspace, papers everywhere (organized chaos)
- **Mood:** Seeing what others can't, the gift that borders on prophecy
- **Tags:** signature-ability, mystical, concentrated, unique

### 2. Creating the Memorial Stones
**Scene:** Fayne carving the L, E, B, I stones at Undershade Canyon, the founding moment of Company heraldry.
- **Pose/Action:** Carefully carving letters into stone, surrounded by recovered relics
- **Setting:** Canyon aftermath, lantern light, somber atmosphere
- **Mood:** Memory made permanent, the first historian's work
- **Tags:** founding-moment, emotional, crafting, significant

### 3. Heraldry Sketches
**Scene:** Fayne's hands at work on the Company heraldry design - lantern and shield boss taking shape on parchment.
- **Pose/Action:** Close-up of ink-stained fingers sketching, multiple design iterations visible
- **Setting:** Desk with drafting tools, good light
- **Mood:** Identity being forged, the visual symbol of a cause
- **Tags:** close-up, crafting, heraldry, creative

### 4. Gender Expression Markers
**Scene:** A subtle study of Fayne's daily identity expression - the small choices (pin placement, belt style, stance) that signal their current state.
- **Pose/Action:** Getting ready or mid-activity, deliberate choices visible
- **Setting:** Personal space or public area
- **Mood:** Identity as art, the daily negotiation of self
- **Tags:** character-depth, subtle, identity, intimate

### 5. Pattern Map Creation
**Scene:** Fayne creating one of their artistic pattern representations - beautiful but incomprehensible to others, a visualization of connections only they can see.
- **Pose/Action:** Working on complex diagram with colored inks and connecting lines
- **Setting:** Private workspace
- **Mood:** Genius visible to none but themselves, the lonely gift
- **Tags:** unique-ability, artistic, mysterious, focused

### 6. Counting Under Stress
**Scene:** Fayne in a crisis moment, lips moving as they count compulsively - the coping mechanism that keeps them grounded.
- **Pose/Action:** Wide eyes, lips moving, fingers perhaps tapping count, but still functioning
- **Setting:** Stressful situation - battle or emergency
- **Mood:** Anxiety channeled into function, the pattern-seeker under pressure
- **Tags:** stress, coping, character-detail, action
