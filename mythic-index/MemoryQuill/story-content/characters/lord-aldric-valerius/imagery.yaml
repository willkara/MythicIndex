appearance: "Lord Aldric Valerius is an imposing human male, appearing to be in his mid-fifties, with a broad build and a stern, aristocratic bearing that commands attention. His impeccably groomed hair is predominantly silver-gray, matching a full, neatly trimmed beard that frames a face marked by deep character lines on his forehead and around his eyes. He looks out with sharp, calculating dark brown eyes, projecting an air of ruthless pragmatism and entrenched authority. He is dressed in rich noble attire suitable for his station, wearing a heavy, dark fur-lined cloak with gold trim over a patterned navy doublet fastened by a row of ornate buttons. A large, tarnished bronze medallion bearing a distinct triangular symbol hangs from a heavy chain around his neck, and a simple gold wedding band is visible on his left ring finger as his hand rests near scrolls on his wooden desk."
