  fantasy_grounding:
    - "warded correspondence: wax seals, anti-tamper sigils, alchemical-ink signatures (power as paperwork)"

    - "House Valerius heraldry worked into ring, clasp, or embroidery; optional Lords' Alliance insignia"
  signature_props:
    - "seal kit (wax, stamp) and a folio of vellum with shimmering guild stamps"
    - "political map or ledger with brass pins and thread markers"
  avoid:
    - "modern politician vibes (suits, microphones, electric lighting)"
    - "overly shiny palace fantasy; keep patina, candle/lamplight, worn authority"
