appearance: "Sergeant Willem Kass is defined by his overwhelming aura of professional military discipline rather than specific striking features. He possesses a rigid, upright bearing that immediately distinguishes him as a competent leader within the City Watch. His uniform is always kept in immaculate condition, clean, pressed, and perfectly fitted, reflecting his strict adherence to order and regulation. The insignia marking him as the commander of the First Company, Second Regiment, are polished to a high shine against the fabric of his attire. He moves with deliberate, practiced efficiency and is rarely caught without a serious, focused expression suited to a defensive commander. Kass is most easily recognized by the absolute precision of his sharp salute and the flawless nature of his presentation, embodying reliable authority amidst the chaos of duty."

      description: "Sergeant Willem Kass, clad in plate armor and a gryphon-emblazoned sash, stands on castle battlements holding a halberd during a dramatic sunset. His grim, determined expression contrasts with the anxious look of the younger soldier behind him as a massive magical energy dome forms in the sky. The scene is rendered as a detailed digital painting with warm, golden light."
      alt_text: "An older armored sergeant with a halberd stands on a castle wall at sunset, looking grimly ahead while a large magical energy field forms in the sky above the garrison."
