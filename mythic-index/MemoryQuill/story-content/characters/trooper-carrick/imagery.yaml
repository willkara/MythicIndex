appearance: "Trooper Carrick is a seasoned human male with a lean, sturdy build and a deeply weathered face that betrays his advancing years. His steely blue eyes, framed by heavy wrinkles and a short, coarse gray beard and mustache, hold an intense, weary gaze beneath the brim of a tarnished metal Morion helmet. He is outfitted in functional, worn metal cuirass armor strapped with thick leather belts over a heavy, dark woolen tunic. In his gloved right hand, he grips the metal ring of a lit brass lantern, casting a warm, flickering glow on his chest and the dark bay horse he rides. Though his serious side wound is hidden beneath his gear, his stiff posture and haggard expression hint at the significant pain he endures. He projects an overall aura of grim resilience and exhausted vigilance in the face of duty."
