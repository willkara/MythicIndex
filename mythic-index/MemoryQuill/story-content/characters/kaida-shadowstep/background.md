# Kaida "Lockbreaker" Shadowstep - Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: TBD (likely an urban area with significant criminal activity)
- **Birth Date**: TBD
- **Social Class**: Lower class, criminal underworld
- **Cultural Background**: Tiefling heritage. She faces the usual prejudice against Tieflings but handles it with a surprising maturity. She sees bias as just another variable in a system—an exploitable weakness an opponent foolishly reveals.

## History
- **The Architect's Fingers**: Kaida's former life was with a small, elite thieving crew.
  - **Silas ("The Eyes"):** The charming intelligence gatherer who found the marks.
  - **Bryn ("The Hammer"):** The stoic half-orc muscle and logistics expert.
  - **Kaida ("The Fingers"):** The master infiltrator who did the delicate work.

- **The Betrayal (The Cassian Heist)**: The crew was betrayed by their own intel man, Silas. He was secretly paid by a rival of their target, Lord Cassian, to set Kaida up. Silas provided a flawless plan but fed them a false date. When Kaida bypassed every security measure and opened the vault, she was met not by treasure, but by Lord Cassian and a dozen City Watch guards led by Captain Thorne Brightward. With no escape, she was arrested.

## Backstory Elements
- **Defining Moments**: 
  - Joining "The Architect's Fingers" and achieving professional mastery.
  - Being betrayed by Silas and arrested by Thorne.
  
- **Past Achievements**: 
  - Master-level expertise in infiltration and trap navigation.
  - A reputation as a "ghost" who leaves no evidence.
  
- **Biggest Failures**: 
  - Trusting Silas, which led to her capture and the dissolution of her crew.
  
- **Primary Motivation**: 
  - To methodically hunt down Silas and understand the full scope of his betrayal.

## How They Got Here
- **Reason for Current Situation**: Serving her sentence on a work-release program with the Last Light Company.
- **Path to Current Location**: Master Thief → Betrayal & Imprisonment → Recruitment by Thorne → Indispensable Company Asset.
- **Goals Prior to Story Start**: Professional excellence in thievery and survival.

## Philosophical Development
- **Past**: Viewed thievery as a high art and a profession deserving of pride.
- **Present**: "Not reformed, just redirected." She now uses her skills to "steal people back," a challenge she finds more rewarding. She maintains her professional pride and still methodically hunts for Silas, but has found a new, more loyal crew in the Company.

## Personal Details
- **Favorite Meal**: Midnight street noodles from the Dock Ward, doused in fire-pepper oil and tossed with charred scallions. She loves how the heat clears her mind after a job, and the vendor still keeps her old "usual" waiting when she visits.
- **Favorite Drink**: A chilled glass of smoked plum wine spiked with a hint of shadowfruit bitters. It's a rare indulgence she rations for nights spent planning heists on chalkboards, savoring the way the drink's sweetness masks a hidden burn.
