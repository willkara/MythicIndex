# Kaida "Lockbreaker" Shadowstep — Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Cautious, cunning, and fiercely independent. A master infiltrator who trusts skill over sentiment; keeps people at arm's length until they prove reliable.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public: curt, economical; says only what advances the objective or tests the room.
- Infiltration/skill use: precise, step-oriented cues—short imperatives or single-image descriptions.
- Under pressure: cool and quick; prefers quiet commands and whispered coordination.
- Humor: dry, edged with cynicism; uses wry remarks to deflect praise or uncomfortable emotion.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Fingers toy with lockpicks or a hidden dagger when nervous or thinking.
- Eyes dart to exits; relaxed eye contact indicates trust.
- A small, almost-smirk is rare and meaningful; a cold laugh signals boundary reinforcement.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Avoids sentimentalities and moral grandstanding; has strict personal ethics—she does not steal from those who cannot afford it.
- Will pocket items opportunistically but rarely flaunts it; defends this as "operational prudence."
- Breaks pattern only in rare private moments when she reveals a scar or a secret—these reveal hard-earned loyalty.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Kaida for tight, tactical lines during stealth or infiltration scenes.
- When adding dialogue, favor clipped sentences, whispered directions, and concise rationales.
- Let her occasionally needle Marcus or trade barbs with Vera—these show social integration without emotional overshare.

## Drop-in sample lines
- Stealth cue: "Silent feet. Shadow on my left. Move on my count—three, two, one."
- Cold aside: "We stole a rescue, not a purse. Keep the line straight."
- Private, rare softness: "Don't call it loyalty yet. Call it a debt owed."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Introduced as a wary, skilled thief on work-release; gradually finds a place within the Company's code—still independent, but with emerging, guarded loyalty.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- Infiltration: short, precise instructions and observations that keep the team synchronized.
- Social friction: barbed quips and tests of honesty that reveal trust dynamics.
- Private interactions: minimal confessions or pragmatic admissions that hint at deeper motives.

## Notes for editors
- Keep Kaida's dialogue sharp and economical; avoid long, justifying monologues.
- Her humor should carry a sting and a usefulness—never gratuitous.
