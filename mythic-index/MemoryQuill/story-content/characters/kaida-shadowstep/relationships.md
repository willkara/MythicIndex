## Professional Relationships
- **Marcus "The Voice" Heartbridge**: 
  - *Nature of Relationship*: Intelligence gathering partner; "The Lock and The Key."

  - *Dynamics*: Theirs is a partnership of pure, silent professionalism. They communicate in half-sentences and shared glances. Marcus gathers the social intelligence, learning the secrets and schedules of a target. He is "The Key" who finds the right moment to turn. Kaida then uses that information for the physical infiltration. She is "The Lock" that can be opened. There is a deep, unspoken understanding between them, as they are the two members who most comfortably operate in the world's gray areas.
  - *History*: TBD

They understand each other's need for space and self-reliance.
