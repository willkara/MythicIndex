## Psychological Profile
*   **Kaida Shadowstep (The Professional):** Kaida views thievery not as a crime, but as a high-skill profession, an art form. She is not "reformed"; her skills have simply been "redirected." Her core psychology is that of a meticulous professional who was betrayed by her former crew. This has left her with a deep-seated distrust of teams and a laser-focus on identifying her betrayer. Her loyalty to the Company is conditional, built on their professionalism and their respect for her skills.
