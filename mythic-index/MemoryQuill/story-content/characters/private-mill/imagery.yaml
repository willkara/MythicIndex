appearance: "Private Mill is a sturdy human male whose weathered, middle-aged face is etched with deep lines of exhaustion and grime. His most prominent feature is a thick white bandage wrapped tightly around his head and stained with a bright patch of fresh blood on the forehead, marking him as a wounded scout. Intense, steel-blue eyes gaze out from beneath the dressing with a stoic and determined expression. He is outfitted in a tarnished metal breastplate secured by worn leather straps over a dark hooded tunic, the chest piece displaying a brass circular emblem featuring a four-pointed star design. In his dirt-stained right hand, he holds a rusted metal lantern that casts a warm glow on his features, while a simple wooden staff rests against his opposite shoulder. Despite the obvious severity of his head injury, his posture and hard stare project an unwavering sense of duty."
