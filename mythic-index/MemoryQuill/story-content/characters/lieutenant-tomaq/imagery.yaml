slug: lieutenant-tomaq
appearance: Lieutenant Tomaq is an imposing, towering orc with a massive frame, broad
  shoulders, and a thick neck. His weathered, deeply lined face is a desaturated moss
  green, matching his bald head and pointed ears. A simple black leather eye patch
  covers his right eye socket, while his remaining dark eye stares out sternly beneath
  heavy brows, accompanied by prominent lower tusks protruding from his jaw. He is
  clad in heavy, dark, textured plate armor that has the appearance of cast iron,
  featuring a rectangular metal insignia badge on the left breastplate. A thick, dark
  grey woolen cloak is draped heavily over his shoulders, secured by worn leather
  straps across his chest. Standing with clasped hands and an unwavering, rigid expression,
  he embodies the severe discipline and professional posture of a career military
  officer.
