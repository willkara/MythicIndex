appearance: "Lieutenant Tomaq is an imposing, towering orc with a massive frame, broad shoulders, and a thick neck. His weathered, deeply lined face is a desaturated moss green, matching his bald head and pointed ears. A simple black leather eye patch covers his right eye socket, while his remaining dark eye stares out sternly beneath heavy brows, accompanied by prominent lower tusks protruding from his jaw. He is clad in heavy, dark, textured plate armor that has the appearance of cast iron, featuring a rectangular metal insignia badge on the left breastplate. A thick, dark grey woolen cloak is draped heavily over his shoulders, secured by worn leather straps across his chest. Standing with clasped hands and an unwavering, rigid expression, he embodies the severe discipline and professional posture of a career military officer."

      description: "A medium shot digital painting depicting Lieutenant Tomaq, a grey-skinned orc with an eyepatch in military uniform, sitting at a rustic wooden desk. He wipes his mouth with a cloth while looking into a small mirror, illuminated by a warm hanging lamp to his left, with a large battleaxe leaning against the stone wall behind him. The style is painterly and realistic with dramatic lighting."

      narrative_significance: "This image reveals Tomaq's discipline, self-reliance, and attention to detail. It contrasts his rugged, martial appearance with a quiet, domestic act of maintenance, suggesting a seasoned professional who takes pride in his service.\n"
      symbolic_elements: "The juxtaposition of instruments of war (sword, helmet) with delicate tools of mending (needle, thread) symbolizes the soldier's need for both aggression and careful preservation. The act of sewing his own rank suggests earned status and personal responsibility.\n"
