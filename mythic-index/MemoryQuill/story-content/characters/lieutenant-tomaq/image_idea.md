## Character Summary
Massive gray-skinned orc City Watch Lieutenant stationed at Westwall Watchpost. Eye patch over left eye, left tusk broken and capped with silver. Contemporary of Thorne from their Watch days. By-the-books professional who must balance local needs with chain of command. Surprisingly skilled with a needle (sews his own chevrons). Tower frame, two-handed battle-axe.
