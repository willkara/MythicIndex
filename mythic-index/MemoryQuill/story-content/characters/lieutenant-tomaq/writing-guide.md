# Lieutenant Tomaq - Comedy Writing Guide

## Comedy Archetype: The One-Eyed Bureaucrat

### Core Comedy Style
**By-the-book inflexibility / Orc + paperwork = comedy**

Tomaq is funny because he's a one-eyed orc warrior who's completely dedicated to PROPER PROCEDURE. He should be intimidating (he is), but he wields regulations like weapons. The contrast between orc warrior and bureaucratic obsession creates comedy gold.

### What Makes Him Funny

- **Orc + regulations** - Intimidating enforcer of paperwork
- **One eye doesn't miss anything** - Especially protocol violations
- **Torn between results and rules** - Grimsby 2.0 but more intimidating
- **Towering frame, tiny clipboard** - Visual comedy
- **Military precision** - Everything by regulation
- **Slowly learning flexibility** - Fighting his nature (Atlock's teaching)

### Example Comedy Moments

```
Tomaq: [towering over team, holding tiny clipboard] "Form 17-B was not filed correctly."
Grimjaw: "We were busy saving lives."
Tomaq: "Section 4, Paragraph 2 requires—"
Veyra: "Lieutenant. We'll refile the form."
Tomaq: [one eye narrowing] "In triplicate?"
Veyra: "...In triplicate."
Tomaq: [satisfied grunt] "Acceptable."
Thorne: [later, to Veyra] "You're enabling him."
Veyra: "He's effective when placated with paperwork."
```

```
[Watching Company's unconventional tactics]
Tomaq: [to Atlock] "Sir, they're violating regulations 4, 7, 12, and... is that a chicken?"
Atlock: "Twenty-seven chickens, Lieutenant."
Tomaq: "There's no regulation for combat chickens."
Atlock: "Observe the results."
[Mission succeeds spectacularly]
Tomaq: [long pause] "...Should I CREATE a regulation for combat chickens?"
Atlock: "Let's call them 'mobile organic barriers' and move on."
Tomaq: [writing] "Mobile. Organic. Barriers. Regulation 43-C."
```

### Relationship Dynamics

**With Atlock:** Student learning flexibility
- Respects commander absolutely
- Struggles with unconventional tactics
- Slowly learning results > method
- Still files reports on everything

**With The Company:** Grudging acceptance
- Effective but irregular
- Torn between results and rules
- Eventually learns from them (slowly)
- Still requires paperwork (always)

### Signature Phrases

- "Regulations require..." (everything)
- "In triplicate"
- "This is why we have standards"
- "Form [X] was not filed correctly"

### Running Gags

- **Wrong Ink Color** - Rejected forms
- **Combat Documentation** - Writing during crisis
- **"In Triplicate"** - Always
- **Tiny Clipboard** - Visual comedy (huge orc, tiny board)

### The Golden Rule

Tomaq is funniest when his intimidating orc warrior presence is deployed in service of PROPER PROCEDURE and CORRECT INK COLORS. He's Grimsby with more physical presence and an eye patch.
