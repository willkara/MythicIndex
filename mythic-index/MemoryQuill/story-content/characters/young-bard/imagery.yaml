appearance: "This young human bard possesses a lean build and an expressive, upturned face framed by a mop of dark brown, unruly curls. His large, deep brown eyes are wide with a look of rapt wonder or surprise, complemented by his slightly parted lips as if catching a breath. He has a fair complexion with a slight, healthy flush on his cheeks. His attire consists of a textured, earthy reddish-brown hooded tunic worn over a rough, lighter-colored undergarment, secured with a simple leather strap across his chest. In his hands, he holds a wooden lute with an intricately carved rosette, his fingers positioned on the fretboard ready to play. His overall demeanor is one of eager observation, forever ready to translate the world around him into song."
