appearance: "Master Elena Brightforge is an older human woman with a solid, robust build and powerful forearms developed from years of physical labor. Her deeply lined face features weathered, ruddy skin and heavy-lidded blue-gray eyes that gaze intently off to the side, conveying a sense of stern professionalism. Her completely gray hair is pulled back tightly from her face into a practical bun. Her hands are large and work-worn with prominent knuckles, clutching a heavy metal sledgehammer with a wooden handle against her chest. She wears a thick, well-used brown leather apron fastened with brass buckles over a dark charcoal cloth shirt with rolled-up sleeves. A heavy metal cuff encircles her left wrist as a distinct accessory to her work gear. Overall, she projects an aura of formidable competence and no-nonsense practicality."
