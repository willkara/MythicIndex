appearance: "Commander Marcus Atlock is a tall, powerfully built human male whose rigid posture reflects decades of military discipline. His deeply weathered face, marked by heavy lines and a stern, uncompromising expression, is framed by short, neat gray hair and intense steel-gray eyes. He is outfitted for the field in a heavy, textured dark brown leather trench coat worn over blackened metal pauldrons and a breastplate secured by thick leather cross-straps bearing a small insignia. A substantial utility belt with attached leather pouches cinches his waist, supporting a sword with a wire-wrapped hilt hanging at his left hip. Below the coat, he wears dark trousers tucked into tall, rugged leather boots reinforced with strapped knee guards. At 52, his commanding presence and pragmatic, battle-worn gear mark him instantly as the veteran leader known as \"Old Iron.\""
