# Commander Atlock - Comedy Writing Guide

## Comedy Archetype: The Dry Professional

### Core Comedy Style
**Understatement / Military dry wit / Chess metaphors**

Atlock is funny through extreme professionalism and understatement. He's seen everything, is impressed by nothing, and delivers devastating observations in the same tone he'd use for weather reports. Think of him as the military dad who's proud but will NEVER say it.

### What Makes Him Funny

- **Extreme understatement** - "That was... unconventional" (watching building explode)
- **Chess metaphors for everything** - Life is a chess game
- **Dry military observations** - Deadpan commentary on chaos
- **Professional to absurd degree** - Formal even in disasters
- **Proud but won't show it** - Secretly impressed, never admits it
- **Strategic assessment of everything** - "Tactically interesting" (compliment)

### Example Comedy Moments

```
[Company uses extremely unorthodox tactics to win]
Atlock: [watching] "That was... creative."
Tomaq: "Sir, they violated every military protocol—"
Atlock: "And saved forty civilians. Tactically interesting."
Tomaq: "But the REGULATIONS—"
Atlock: "Results matter, Lieutenant. Though perhaps don't include the... flaming cart in your report."
```

```
Atlock: "Your approach reminds me of the Sicilian Defense."
Veyra: "...Chess?"
Atlock: "Appears defensive, reveals aggressive intent. You sacrifice positional advantage for tactical flexibility."
Thorne: "He's complimenting you."
Veyra: "Is he?"
Atlock: "The Sicilian is highly effective in skilled hands."
Veyra: "...Thank you?"
Atlock: "You're welcome."
```

```
[Reviewing mission report]
Atlock: "You infiltrated a mercenary compound, extracted three hostages, defeated twenty-seven armed guards, and... is this correct... did so using a cart full of chickens?"
Grimjaw: "Aye."
Atlock: [long pause] "Explain."
Grimjaw: "Distraction, sir."
Atlock: "With chickens."
Grimjaw: "Very effective chickens, sir."
Atlock: [writing] "I'm noting this as 'improvised mobile barriers.'"
```

### Relationship Dynamics

**With The Company:** Grudging respect
- Values results over methods
- Provides political cover
- Never says he's impressed (always is)
- "Unconventional but effective"

**With Tomaq:** Mentor and student
- Teaches flexibility through example
- "Learn from their tactics, Lieutenant"
- Patient with by-the-book attitude
- Dry corrections of rigidity

**With Grimsby:** Professional rivalry
- Both commanders, different approaches
- Atlock values results, Grimsby values protocol
- Subtle political maneuvering
- Never overt conflict (very professional)

### Signature Comedy Beats

1. **Watches Chaos** → Long Pause → Understatement → "Tactically interesting"
2. **Chess Metaphor** → Confused Looks → Thorne Translation → Understanding
3. **Reviews Report** → Raises Eyebrow → "Explain" → Accepts Absurdity
4. **Almost Smiles** → Catches Self → Professional Mask → Back to Business

### Quick Reference

**Funny when:** Understating chaos, chess metaphors, accepting absurd tactics, almost showing emotion
**NOT funny when:** Actually in command during crisis, genuine tactical discussion, protecting subordinates

### The Golden Rule

Atlock is funniest when his extreme military professionalism and understatement contrast with the Company's spectacular chaos. He's proud but will die before admitting it directly. Everything is a chess game.
