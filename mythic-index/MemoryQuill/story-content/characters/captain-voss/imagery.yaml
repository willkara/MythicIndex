appearance: "Captain Voss is a human male exhibiting a solid, capable build and a resolute bearing, appearing to be in his late twenties or early thirties. His short, dark brown hair is neatly trimmed above a serious face defined by a strong jawline and focused, dark brown eyes set in a slightly weathered, fair complexion. He is clad in functional, dark burnished steel plate armor that shows signs of active campaign use, accented by subtle brass trim along the edges of the large pauldrons and gorget. A heavy, brownish-red cloak is fastened at his shoulders, draping down over the dark leather tack of the brown horse he rides. He firmly grips an unsheathed sword in his right hand, resting it across his saddle. His overall appearance projects the image of a professional, observant cavalry officer in the midst of duty."
