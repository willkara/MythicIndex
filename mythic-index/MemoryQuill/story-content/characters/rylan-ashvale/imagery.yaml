appearance: "Rylan Ashvale is an elf with a slender but defined facial structure and an intense, determined upward gaze that suggests focused maturity. His voluminous, windswept hair is a striking gradient, transitioning from dark, stormy grey-brown at the roots to brilliant silver-white at the tips, appearing as if charged by the storm around him. His eyes glow with a brilliant, almost whitish-blue light, mirroring the electrical energy that crackles around his face and the large, rough-hewn wooden staff topped with a glowing crystal he grips firmly. A single silver drop earring hangs from his visible pointed ear, and he wears a heavy, dark textured cloak over a deep blue cowl and practical layered brown leather tunic with strapped belts. A glowing reddish-brown phoenix flies just above his shoulder amidst the roiling storm clouds, cementing his image as a powerful manipulator of atmospheric forces."
