## Development Notes
- Character represents the balance between academic knowledge and practical application
- The phoenix familiar symbolizes rebirth from his interdimensional experience
- His changing hair and eyes reflect his connection to weather magic and emotional states
- The lightning scar is a physical reminder of his experience between planes
- The philosophical debates with Nireya highlight different approaches to magic
- His relationship with Cid demonstrates intellectual kinship
- His pragmatic view of the dimensional accident ("occupational hazard") shows his dedication to knowledge
- Future development could explore consequences of pushing magical boundaries

## Psychological Profile
*   **Rylan Ashvale (The Academic):** Rylan is driven by an insatiable intellectual curiosity. To him, magic is not a mystical force, but a complex, fascinating system to be studied, catalogued, and understood. His dimensional accident was not a trauma, but an "unexpected field experiment." He is logical and analytical, sometimes to a fault, and may view emotional responses as inefficient variables. He seeks knowledge for its own sake, and the Company provides him with an endless supply of unique magical phenomena to study.
