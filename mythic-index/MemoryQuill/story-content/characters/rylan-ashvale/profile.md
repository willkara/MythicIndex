# Rylan Ashvale - Profile

## Basic Information
- **Full Name**: Rylan Ashvale
- **Aliases/Nicknames**: Stormhand
- **Race**: Elf
- **Class**: Wizard
- **Role in Story**: Magical Support for the Last Light Company
- **First Appearance**: TBD
- **Status**: Active

## Physical Description
- **Height/Build**: Typical elven height and slender build
- **Hair**: Most striking feature - a living representation of a storm that shifts from dark, loamy brown at the roots to stormy gray in the middle, ending in pure white at the tips like a storm cloud giving way to snow. When emotional or casting, a faint breeze seems to rustle through it even indoors.
- **Eyes**: Change with mood and weather - bright cloudless blue on clear days, darkening to stormy gray when concentrating, with tiny sparks of lightning visible in their depths
- **Distinguishing Features**: 
  - A delicate, silvery scar traces a branching path from his temple down his cheek - not disfiguring but beautiful, like fossilized lightning that sometimes glows with soft blue light during spellcasting
  - A single shimmering phoenix feather woven into one of his braids, catching light like a tiny flickering flame
- **Typical Clothing**: Practical mage attire suited for field work, with earth and sky adornments - an amber necklace with a prehistoric insect trapped within, silver raindrop earrings, and rings with polished river stones and swirling wind designs
- **Body Language**: Precise, calculated movements with occasional unpredictable gestures (like weather patterns)
- **Physical Condition**: Healthy, with an otherworldly quality from his brief experience trapped between dimensions

## Visual References
- **Associated Images**: See [Image Descriptions](images/image_descriptions.md) for detailed visual descriptions of Rylan Ashvale.

## Personality
- **Archetype**: The Academic/Researcher
- **Temperament**: Structured, analytical, intellectually curious
- **Positive Traits**: Brilliant, detail-oriented, methodical, knowledge-seeking
- **Negative Traits**: Possibly overly focused on research goals, may take calculated risks
- **Moral Alignment**: Neutral Good (primarily concerned with advancing knowledge while helping others)

## Skills & Abilities
- **Expertise**: Weather magic, planar convergence theory, elemental manipulation
- **Languages**: Common, Elvish, likely Primordial and other languages related to elemental planes
- **Education Level**: Highly educated in arcane theory and planar studies
- **Special Abilities**: 
  - Weather manipulation (can influence local atmospheric conditions)
  - Limited ability to detect planar anomalies from his experience trapped between dimensions
  - Theoretical understanding of planar convergence points
  - Connection with phoenix familiar

## Personal Details
- **Habits**: Taking meticulous notes on magical phenomena
- **Hobbies**: Studying ancient magical texts, experimenting with weather spells
- **Personal Quarters**: A circular room directly beneath the Aerie in the Tower of Innovation. The most prominent feature is a massive, domed skylight of reinforced, enchanted glass that serves as the floor of the observatory above. The room is a comfortable chaos of books and scrolls, stacked in precarious towers on every available surface. This is his personal library and think-tank. The light in the room is never constant, shifting in color and intensity as the magical energies from the Aerie's instruments filter down through the skylight. He often falls asleep in a large, overstuffed armchair, a heavy tome resting on his chest. One entire wall is a massive chalkboard, covered from top to bottom in a chaotic but brilliant scrawl of arcane equations, weather predictions, and complex planar charts. His phoenix familiar has a grand, magically-warmed perch of driftwood near the ceiling, from which it occasionally drops shimmering, harmless ash that he collects in a small crystal bowl on his desk.
- **Likes**: Academic discussion, discovering new magical theories, proving hypotheses
- **Dislikes**: Dismissal of theoretical magic, rigid thinking, limitations on research
- **Fears**: Possibly being permanently trapped between planes

## Combat & Tactics
- **Primary Weapon**: "Axiom" - crystal-tipped staff that serves as both weather focus and lightning rod, named for fundamental truths of magic
- **Phoenix Familiar**: "Quill" - mystical firebird who guided him back from between dimensions, serves as aerial scout and living reminder of rebirth
- **Spell Focus**: Earth and sky adornments that resonate with elemental forces - amber for earth, silver for air
- **Armor**: Flowing robes that shift color with weather patterns - practical protection through magical deflection
- **Fighting Style**: Environmental controller - changes battlefield conditions through atmospheric manipulation
- **Signature Move**: "Eye of the Storm" - creates localized weather phenomena from fog to lightning strikes
- **Combat Philosophy**: "Nature is neither cruel nor kind, merely inevitable - I simply adjust the timetable"
- **Tactical Role**: Battlefield manipulation through weather control, aerial superiority via Quill's reconnaissance

## Psychological Response Matrix
- **In Crisis**: Calculates probabilities like solving equations - "Given these variables, the optimal solution is..."
- **During Negotiation**: Provides literal environmental pressure - storm clouds as visual representation of tension
- **Moral Dilemma**: Seeks precedent in magical theory and documented cases before deciding
- **Team Conflict**: Offers perspective from "30,000 feet" - both literally (via Quill) and metaphorically
- **Under Personal Attack**: Treats it as peer review - takes notes on criticism for later analysis
- **In Victory**: Documents everything - magical expenditure, weather patterns, unexpected interactions
- **Research Mode**: Complete tunnel vision - Cid builds while thinking, Rylan theorizes while forgetting to eat

## Voice & Dialogue Patterns
- **Speech Style**: Academic precision with weather metaphors, often explaining theory during action
- **Signature Phrases**: 
  - "According to Axiom's readings..." (treating his staff like a measurement device)
  - "Statistically speaking..." (before doing something risky)
  - "Fascinating! Quill, are you recording this?"
  - "The probability matrix suggests..."
- **Academic Counterpoint to Cid**: Where Cid says "Let's try it!", Rylan says "My calculations indicate a 73% success rate"
- **Example Dialogue**: "The barometric pressure via Axiom indicates precipitation in—oh, Quill's feathers are already smoking. Make that immediate precipitation."
- **Emotional Tells**: Hair moves faster when excited, consults Axiom like checking notes, Quill mimics his hand gestures
- **Teaching Mode**: Can't help but lecture even in combat - "Notice how the thermal updraft creates a perfect—duck!"

## Notes
- Views his dimensional accident as "an occupational hazard of the job" rather than trauma
- Joined the Last Light Company to study planar anomalies and magical sites they encounter during rescue operations
- Has excellent relationships with Cid (kindred spirit in pursuit of knowledge) and Nireya (shared respect for magic despite philosophical differences)
- More structured and academic in his approach to magic compared to other practitioners
- Sometimes engages in respectful philosophical arguments about "pushing boundaries to learn more" versus "accepting magic as simply part of life's natural order"

### Public Perception
- Known as the "Weather Mage," with rumors of his magic being unpredictable and having a mind of its own, sometimes with unintended consequences.
- His phoenix familiar is a source of both awe and unease, seen by some as a sign of good luck and by others as a sign of meddling with dangerous forces.
- Respected for his brilliant mind and academic approach to magic, often working with Vera to track and locate missing persons.
