# Rylan Ashvale - Dialogue & Psyche

## Core temperament
Measured, curious, and precise. A scholar of patterns and weather; speaks with an elven clarity that treats magic as craft and inquiry.

## Dialogue instincts
- Public: calm, slightly formal; explains arcane phenomena with analogies to weather and currents.
- Teaching/analysis: patient, methodical—lays out observation, inference, conclusion in ordered turns.
- Under pressure: voice remains calm; chooses exact language to avoid panic-driven mistakes.
- Humor: wry, often metaphoric; enjoys clever turns of phrase tied to wind and sky.

## Emotional anchors & physical tells
- Hands weave small gestures as if tracing currents in the air; fingers twitch when invoking minor wards.
- Eyes track small changes (light, humidity); a lifted brow signals new insight.
- A soft exhale accompanies successful calculations; abrupt inhalation indicates something unsettled.

## Conflict & humor rules
- Avoids flippancy about planar or mystical dangers; treats such topics with respectful curiosity.
- Will deflate grandstanding with a precise correction or a weather simile.
- Uses light, intellectual irony to defuse tense conversations, not coarse joking.

## Writer cues (practical)
- Use Rylan to explain magical or environmental causes succinctly; keep explanations anchored in sensory metaphors (wind, pressure, needle of rain).
- When inserting lines, maintain an ordered logic in his speech: observation → analogy → recommendation.
- Pair technical lines with a small physical gesture of measurement (sweeps, pinches of air, examining a gauge).

## Drop-in sample lines
- Observation/explain: "The ley-thread here hums like a taut wire—tension increasing toward the east."
- Tactical advise: "Winds will favor a southern egress in three breaths. Time the lift with my signal."
- Comforting/curious: "There are patterns to grief as there are to storms. We read them the same: patiently."

## Voice evolution note (chapters 1–9)
- Starts as an aloof specialist with academic distance; increasingly bonds with the Company as he sees practical application for his study.
- Moves from theoretic aside to pragmatic partner—keeps curiosity but learns to value steady companionship.

## Usage examples (scenes)
- In briefings: offers short, clarifying metaphors and precise timing recommendations.
- During magic use: speaks calmly, using ordered clauses that keep teammates synchronized.
- In quiet moments: reflective lines that tie natural cycles to human resilience.

## Notes for editors
- Keep Rylan's language precise and image-driven (wind/pressure/current). Avoid making his exposition long-winded—break into small turns.
