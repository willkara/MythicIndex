appearance: "Lysander Valerius is a human male in his late twenties with a robust, athletic build and a confident, measured bearing. He has short, wavy dark brown hair swept back from a broad forehead, and his intense, steady dark brown eyes look off-camera with a serious, commanding expression. His fair skin shows warm undertones beneath dramatic lighting that highlights his strong jawline. He wears a heavy, well-worn dark leather military-style jack characterized by a high collar, strapped front closures, and segmented shoulder pauldrons adorned with metallic rivets. A heavy dark woolen cloak is draped over his left side, and his left hand rests on the metallic pommel of a sword sheathed at his hip. Captured mid-stride with his right hand extended in an open gesture, Lysander projects the charismatic aura of a natural leader even in a moment of urgency."
