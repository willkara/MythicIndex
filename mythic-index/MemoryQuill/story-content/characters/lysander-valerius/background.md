# Lysander Valerius - Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: Waterdeep
- **Social Class**: Minor nobility, son of a Waterdhavian noble.
- **Cultural Background**: Raised with the expectations and education of a noble house, but with a strong personal interest in the heroic traditions of the past.

## Family
- **Parents**: Noble house Valerius, minor nobility in Waterdeep. Provided classical education and expected traditional noble careers from both sons.
- **Siblings**: Cassius Valerius (older brother) - brilliant scholar specializing in antiquities and genealogies at the Great Library. Where Lysander was drawn to adventure, Cassius was drawn to dusty tomes and ancient knowledge. Despite their different paths, the brothers maintained a close, loving relationship.
- **Family Dynamics**: Regular visits where Lysander would regale Cassius with stories of his adventures, while Cassius shared discoveries from his research. Lysander deeply respected his brother's intellectual courage and often joked that Cassius faced down "centuries of accumulated knowledge" daily - the real bravery.

## History
- **Professional Career**: The founder and charismatic leader of the Gilded Compass adventuring party. He brought the team together, funding their expeditions and providing them with a shared purpose.
- **A Noble Pursuit**: Lysander was a student of ancient history and mythology. He wasn't just an adventurer; he was a scholar seeking to walk in the footsteps of the heroes he'd read about. He believed that the old tales were not just stories, but manuals for living a life of honor. He founded the Gilded Compass with the ambition of creating a new generation of heroes worthy of the old songs.
- **Family Legacy**: His death was reported to the family as a routine adventuring accident. Cassius and their parents never learned of his heroic sacrifice at Undershade Canyon, where he held a collapsing tunnel open with his shield to save his companions' lives. His uncle, Lord Aldric Valerius, has actively worked to suppress the true circumstances of the dragon cult attack, using his Lords' Alliance influence to ensure the official records call it "misadventure" rather than cult activity.

## Personal Details
- **How He Relaxed**: He was a gifted lute player. In the evenings, he would often play quiet, thoughtful melodies that he composed himself. Unlike a boisterous tavern bard, his music was reflective and often a bit melancholy, a private space where he processed the burdens of leadership and the dangers his friends faced.
- **Favorite Meal**: Roast Duck with a cherry reduction sauce. It was a taste of the noble life he came from, but he insisted on preparing it himself over a campfire. This act of preparing a fine meal in a humble setting was his way of bridging the gap between his noble birth and his chosen life, sharing a piece of his world with the companions he considered his true family.
- **Favorite Drink**: Spiced mulled wine infused with clove, orange, and a whisper of starfire brandy. He poured it into tin cups for his companions after victories, toasting "to heroes found, not born."
