appearance: "Thorin Ironbark is a stout, elderly dwarf whose deeply weathered, ruddy face is etched with profound lines of age and experience. His most defining feature is his magnificent, matted beard, a grizzled tangle of grey and brown hair heavily interwoven with vibrant green moss and forest foliage, literally embodying his druidic nature. Deep-set, warm brown eyes gaze steadily from beneath a heavy, furrowed brow. He is clad in a rough-spun, dark charcoal wool cloak clasped with a prominent round bronze brooch featuring a spoked wheel design. In his calloused hands, he firmly grips a rough, gnarled wooden staff and a tarnished brass lantern emitting a soft, warm glow. His overall appearance projects an aura of ancient, grounded wisdom and an inextricable connection to the deep forests he inhabits."
