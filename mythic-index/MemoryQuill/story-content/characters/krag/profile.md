## Notes
*   **Humiliation and Vengeance**: After being publicly humiliated by the Last Light Company at Stonebridge, his pride drove him to assemble a multi-company mercenary force to destroy them, turning a professional dispute into a personal vendetta.
*   **Tactical Defeat**: Despite his experience, his assault on the Westwall Watchpost was systematically dismantled by Grimjaw's superior engineering, the Company's coordinated defense, and Vera's unexpected primal power.
*   **Permanently Maimed**: In the battle's climax, his sword arm was brutally crushed and broken by Vera in her feral hybrid form. The injury is permanent and career-ending, destroying his identity as a warrior.
*   **Broken and Captured**: Defeated, maimed, and with his mercenary force shattered, he was captured by Commander Atlock's cavalry. His reputation as a formidable commander is in ruins.
