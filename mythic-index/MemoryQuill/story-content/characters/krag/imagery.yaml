slug: "krag"
appearance: "Krag is a towering, immense figure of clear giant-kin heritage, possessing a thick neck and massive frame that dwarfs ordinary men. His weathered, ruddy face, appearing to be in its late thirties, is framed by a very short, dark crew cut and a dense, dark beard that shows the grit of the battlefield. His eyes are dark brown, shadowed beneath a heavy, prominent brow ridge, and his nose is noticeably broad and flattened, suggesting it has been broken previously. He is encased in a full suit of functional, heavy plate armor made of darkened, pitted iron or steel that shows significant signs of wear rather than polish. In his gauntleted right hand, he grips a huge, plain broadsword across his midsection, ready for use. The overall impression he leaves is one of overwhelming physical strength, brutality, and a dominating, somber presence."
