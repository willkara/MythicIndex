appearance: "Thomas Blackwood is a young human male, appearing around his true age of nineteen, with an average frame and a lean build developed from honest work. He has short, wavy coppery-brown hair and warm, direct brown eyes set in a fair, fresh-faced complexion with a slight ruddy flush on his cheeks. Distinctive features include somewhat prominent ears and a faint cleft in his chin. He is dressed for his trade as an apprentice, wearing a thick, well-worn brown leather apron over a dark, coarse-textured collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up to reveal his forearms. A small, dark circular object, perhaps a tool of his jewelry trade, is pinned to the left strap of his apron. His expression is calm and earnest, conveying the quiet confidence of a hardworking young man dedicated to learning his craft."
