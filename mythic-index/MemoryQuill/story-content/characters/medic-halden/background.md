# Medic Halden – Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: Waterdeep
- **Social Class**: Middle class
- **Cultural Background**: Human (Tethyrian); raised in a family of artisans.

## Family
- **Family Dynamics**: Halden has no family in the city. He is a solitary man who finds more comfort in the quiet company of his plants than in people.

## History
- **Youth**: Apprenticed to an apothecary, where he showed great promise in the healing arts.
- **Formative Event**: In his youth, the apothecary he worked for secretly sold poisons on the side. A batch that Halden unknowingly helped prepare was used in a high-profile assassination. Though he was officially cleared of any wrongdoing, the guilt from the event has haunted him ever since.
- **Motivation for Joining the Watch**: He joined the City Watch as an act of atonement. He sought to dedicate his life to saving others, to balance the scales for the life he feels he inadvertently helped take. The structured, clearly righteous work of a Watch medic provided a shield against the moral ambiguity that marked his youth.
- **Hobbies**: He is an accomplished botanist, tending to a small but impressive rooftop garden where he cultivates rare plants for poultices, salves, and personal study. His small apartment is filled with medicinal herbs and anatomical charts.

## Personal Details
- **Favorite Meal**: A hearty bowl of mushroom-barley stew simmered with rooftop-grown herbs. He swears the earthy aroma calms the tremor in his hands after a long night in the infirmary.
- **Favorite Drink**: A carefully steeped tisane of chamomile, lavender, and a single sprig of night-blooming cereus. He drinks it lukewarm, appreciating how the floral bitterness reminds him that healing rarely tastes sweet at first sip.
