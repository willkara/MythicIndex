appearance: "Medic Halden is a sturdy human male of Tethyrian descent, appearing to be in his late thirties or forties with a weathered, tanned complexion and short dark brown hair tucked beneath his brimmed metal helmet. His dark brown eyes hold an earnest, sober gaze, reflecting the methodical discipline needed for his role, while a light stubble covers his strong jaw. He is outfitted for field duty in dark, functional City Guard plate armor over a thick tunic, including a cuirass and pauldrons secured with worn leather straps, along with thick leather gauntlets and heavy boots with greaves. The most striking feature of his practical gear is the large, well-used canvas and leather satchel slung at his hip, bearing a prominent red cross emblem that clearly identifies him as the company medic. His overall presence projects grounded reliability and competent, patient-focused care amidst the somber tones of his environment."
