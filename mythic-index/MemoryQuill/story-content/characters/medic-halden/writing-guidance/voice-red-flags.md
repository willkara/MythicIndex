# Medic Halden - Voice Red Flags

---

## Critical Red Flags

### ❌ Philosophical Digressions

**Problem:** That's Aldwin. Halden is action-focused, not philosophical.

**Violation:** "The nature of healing is..." or "Consider the body's natural..."

**Correct:** "Bleeding stopped. Infection risk low. She needs rest."

---

### ❌ Over-Explanation

**Problem:** Field medic speaks with urgency, not elaborate reasoning.

**Violation:** Long explanation of why casualty needs treatment.

**Correct:** "Critical wound. Get supplies. Move now."

---

### ❌ Hesitation

**Problem:** Halden acts decisively, "Already on it" anticipatory style.

**Violation:** "Maybe we should... perhaps we could..."

**Correct:** "Already handling it. Move to the side."

---

### ❌ Missing "Already On It"

**Problem:** Signature phrase should appear in major scenes.

**Violation:** Halden dialogue without anticipatory action signature.

---

## Moderate Red Flags

### ⚠️ Words/Line Over 12

**Problem:** Halden is 8.4 avg - shorter than Aldwin (13.7).

**Violation:** 15+ word sentences.

**Correction:** Keep urgent and brief.

---

### ⚠️ Missing Precise Casualty Reports

**Problem:** Specific counts are Halden's signature.

**Violation:** Vague casualty status.

**Correct:** "Two critical, three stable, one stable-but-declining."

---

### ⚠️ Not Deferring to Aldwin

**Problem:** Halden knows limits, defers appropriately.

**Violation:** Attempting complex healing beyond field medicine.

**Correction:** "This needs Aldwin. Get the healer."
