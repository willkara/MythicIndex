# Medic Halden – Character Development

## Personality Core
- **Defining Traits**: Methodical, empathetic, quiet, patient-focused, carries a deep-seated guilt.
- **Core Values**: The sanctity of life, the importance of healing, atonement through service.
- **Motivations**: To balance the scales for a past mistake by saving as many lives as he can.
- **Fears**: His skills failing someone in need, being unable to help, causing unintentional harm.
- **Internal Conflicts**: His gentle nature is often at odds with the brutal violence he must witness and treat as a Watch medic.

## Character Arc

- **Catalyst Events**: Witnessing Veyra prioritize the dignity of the dead over her own life-threatening injuries.
- **Current State**: A dedicated member of the Last Light Company, finding that its mission of pure rescue aligns perfectly with his need for atonement.
- **Intended Destination**: To become a senior healer within the Company, working alongside Aldwin to blend practical and magical healing, and finally finding peace with his past.

## Key Relationships
- **Relationship to Thorne**: Thorne is his protector. Halden is not a natural soldier and is often unnerved by the violence of their work. He trusts Thorne to create the space and security that allows him to do his job. He sees the Captain as a bulwark against the chaos, a figure of authority who keeps him safe while he tends to the wounded.
- **Reaction to Veyra**:
    - **First Thought**: "The burns... the shock... she needs treatment now." His immediate reaction was purely clinical, a professional assessment of her injuries.
    - **Why He Followed**: He was profoundly moved by her first words: "See to the dead first." As a healer, he had never encountered someone who prioritized the dignity of the fallen over their own intense suffering. It was a profound act of compassion that resonated with his own guilt-ridden soul. When he later taught her pain management, he saw a student with an iron will and a deep respect for the discipline of healing. He follows her not just out of loyalty to Thorne, but because he believes her mission is a purer form of healing than he could practice anywhere else—healing a broken world, one rescue at a time.
