## Visual Summary

## Significance
Captain Grimsby represents the institutional inertia and professional skepticism that Thorne and Veyra must overcome. He is not evil, but he is rigid, following the manual over battlefield realities. His conflict with Thorne serves to highlight Thorne's growing loyalty to Veyra's mission over his formal duties and will likely be the source of future political trouble.

## Key Actions
- Confronted Thorne at the scene of the Dock Ward fire
- Questioned Thorne's decision to bring a "civilian liability" into a hot zone
- Dismissed Veyra's past trauma as a disqualifier rather than a source of expertise
- Was silenced when Veyra's prediction about the fire proved correct

## Personality Traits
- By-the-book traditionalist
- Skeptical of outsiders and unconventional methods
- Concerned with liability and official reports
- Represents the established order of the City Watch

## Future Role
Likely to be a recurring professional antagonist, filing reports about Thorne's "unorthodox" methods and creating political obstacles for the nascent Last Light Company.
