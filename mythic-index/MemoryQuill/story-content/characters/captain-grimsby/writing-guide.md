# Captain Grimsby - Comedy Writing Guide

## Comedy Archetype: The Bureaucratic Obstacle

### Core Comedy Style
**By-the-book stubbornness / Professional pearl-clutching**

Grimsby is funny because he's the walking embodiment of "that's not regulation." He's not evil, just inflexible—obsessed with protocol, reports, and proper procedure while the world burns around him. Perfect straight man for the Company's chaos.

### What Makes Him Funny

- **Everything must be regulation** - "Is there a FORM for this?"
- **Professional pearl-clutching** - Horrified by improper procedure
- **Report obsession** - Documents everything in triplicate
- **Liability concerns** - "This is a PAPERWORK NIGHTMARE"
- **Predictable disapproval** - Team can set watches by it
- **Eventually proven wrong** - But never admits it

### Example Comedy Moments

```
Grimsby: "Captain Brightward, you brought a CIVILIAN to an active fire scene?"
Thorne: "She predicted the collapse—"
Grimsby: "Where is the FORM authorizing civilian consultation?"
Veyra: "The building was actively collapsing."
Grimsby: "There's a procedure for that. Section Seven, Subsection Four, Paragraph—"
[Building collapses exactly as Veyra predicted]
Grimsby: [covered in ash] "...I'll need to file an incident report."
```

```
Grimsby: "This rescue operation violated SEVENTEEN regulations."
Veyra: "We saved twelve lives."
Grimsby: "In an UNAPPROVED MANNER."
Thorne: "Would you prefer we let them die... properly?"
Grimsby: "I prefer you FOLLOW PROTOCOL."
[Later, forced to commend them publicly while dying inside]
```

### Relationship Dynamics

**With Thorne:** Peer antagonism
- Both captains, different philosophies
- Grimsby files reports, Thorne ignores them
- Professional rivalry without malice
- "You're making my life difficult" / "I'm saving lives"

**With Veyra:** Liability incarnate
- He views her as walking lawsuit
- She proves him wrong (he won't admit it)
- His reports get progressively more frustrated
- "How is she STILL not official?"

**With The Company:** Bureaucratic nemesis
- They break rules, he documents it
- Eventually accepts they're effective (grudgingly)
- Never says it out loud
- Continues filing reports anyway

### Running Gags

- **"There's a FORM for that"** - Always
- **Report Drafting** - Mid-crisis documentation
- **Regulation Violations** - Running count
- **"This is irregular"** - His catchphrase
- **Never Admits He's Wrong** - Even when obviously wrong

### Quick Reference

**Funny when:** Enforcing rules during chaos, filing reports mid-crisis, being proven wrong (won't admit it)
**NOT funny when:** Actually has a point about safety, rare moments of competence

### The Golden Rule

Grimsby is funniest when he's absolutely, technically correct about regulations while being completely, practically wrong about reality. He represents institutional inertia—not evil, just impossibly rigid.
