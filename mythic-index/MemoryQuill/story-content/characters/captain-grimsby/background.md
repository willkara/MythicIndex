# Captain Grimsby - Background

## Origin
- **Birthplace**: Waterdeep
- **Social Class**: Likely middle class, a family with a history of civic service.
- **Cultural Background**: Urban, deeply ingrained in the traditions and regulations of the Waterdeep City Watch.

## History
- **Professional Career**: A veteran officer of the City Watch who has risen through the ranks to the position of Captain. He is a contemporary of Thorne Brightward.
- **A Defining Tragedy**: Early in his career, Grimsby was a promising, flexible officer. However, he was the ranking officer at a scene where a junior constable, acting on a "gut feeling" and ignoring protocol, rushed into a hostage situation and was killed. The subsequent inquiry nearly ended Grimsby's career. The incident instilled in him a deep-seated, trauma-induced belief that the rules and the manual are the only things that prevent chaos and keep his officers safe. His rigidity is not born of malice, but of a profound, personal fear of repeating past mistakes.

## Personal Details
- **How He Relaxes**: He is an avid player of "Sovereigns," a highly complex, chess-like board game that has hundreds of rules and established opening moves. He finds the game's rigid structure and predictable outcomes deeply calming. He plays by correspondence with several other Watch captains across the Sword Coast.
- **Favorite Meal**: A very specific, unvarying meal from the officer's mess: boiled beef, potatoes, and carrots, served at precisely six o'clock every evening. He doesn't particularly enjoy it, but he finds comfort in its absolute predictability.
- **Favorite Drink**: Black tea brewed for exactly four minutes, taken without sugar or milk from a chipped Watch-issue mug. He records each pot in his duty log, another small ritual that keeps the world orderly.
