appearance: "Captain Grimsby is a powerfully built human male whose deeply lined, weathered face carries the weight of many years as a veteran officer. His most striking features are his intense, deep-set dark hazel eyes staring from beneath heavy brows, and a magnificent, bushy grey-brown walrus mustache that dominates his lower face. He is immaculately dressed in the formal dark blue tunic of a Watch Captain, distinguished by a high collar rich with gold oak leaf embroidery and a polished dark helmet adorned with brass trim and a central lion crest. A heavy brown leather baldric with brass fittings crosses his broad chest, supporting an ornate ceremonial sword characterized by its gilded brass basket hilt and thick gold bullion tassel. A prominent gold star medal encrusted with red enamel and topped with a crown emblem rests squarely on his left breast. His unyielding stare and rigid posture perfectly embody his reputation as a stern, by-the-book traditionalist of the City Watch."
