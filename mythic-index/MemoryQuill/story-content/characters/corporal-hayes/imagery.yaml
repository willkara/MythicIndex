appearance: "Corporal Hayes presents the rugged, functional appearance of a veteran City Watch scout, currently marked heavily by the toll of recent duty. His most defining physical characteristic is a severe arrow wound to his shoulder, now wrapped in hasty, blood-stained bandages that add bulk beneath his gear. This injury forces a stiff, guarded posture, though his expression remains one of grim, unwavering determination despite the evident pain. His uniform consists of practical, worn leather armor suited for stealthy reconnaissance, now likely mud-splattered from the field. He is rarely seen without his heavy crossbow, carried constantly and handled skillfully with his good arm despite his impairment. The combination of his visible injury and his stubborn refusal to yield makes him stand out as a symbol of resilience among the ranks."
