## Recommendations

### High Priority (Create Profiles)
1. **`professor-aldara-stoneforge`** - Appears in 3 chapters, academic role
2. **`tennison-quill`** - Appears in 2 chapters, journalist
3. **`waterdeep-chronicle`** - Appears in 3 chapters, key story location
4. **`thornwood-forest`** - Appears in 4 chapters, significant wilderness area

### Medium Priority (Consider Profiles)
- `quierk` - Recurring character in later chapters
- `clerk-dena` - Minor recurring bureaucrat
- `jorik-thornfield` / `jenny-copperwright` - Academic supporting cast
- `druid-grove-waterdeep` - May need to merge with existing `druid-grove-waterdeep`

### Low Priority (Remove or Keep As-Is)
- `waterdeep` - Too broad, remove from `key_locations`
- `dock-ward` - Too broad, or create as district overview
- Single-appearance nobles/NPCs - Background characters, may not need profiles
- One-off tavern names - Flavor locations

## Notes for Generation

When generating profiles for missing entities, consider:

1. **Chapter Context**: Read the relevant chapter(s) to understand the character's role and relationships
2. **Naming Patterns**: Follow existing slug conventions (lowercase, hyphenated)
3. **Profile Depth**: Minor characters need less detail than main cast
4. **Location Hierarchy**: Some locations may be sub-locations of others (e.g., `castle-balcony` is part of `castle-waterdeep`)
