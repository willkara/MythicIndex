# How-To: Show vs Tell

**Purpose:** Transform telling statements into showing through sensory/action details.

**Core Principle:** Don't announce feeling/trait/relationship. Demonstrate through action, sensory detail, or dialogue content.

## Emotion Transformation

### ❌ TELLING

"Veyra was angry."
"She felt afraid."
"Marcus was nervous."

### ✅ SHOWING (Action)

**Anger:**
"Veyra's hand drifted to her dagger. 'Marcus.' His name left her mouth like a curse."
[Hand movement + vocal tone delivery shows anger without stating it]

**Fear:**
"Her pulse hammered in her throat. Every shadow looked like an ambush."
[Physical symptom + threat perception shows fear without saying it]

**Nervousness:**
"Marcus shuffled the papers again, the third time in as many minutes."
[Repetitive nervous action shows anxiety without naming it]

---

## Relationship Transformation

### ❌ TELLING

"They trusted each other."
"She loved him."
"Marcus betrayed them."

### ✅ SHOWING (Action/Choice)

**Trust:**
"Veyra turned her back on him without hesitation. Only Thorne earned that."
[Action of exposed back shows deep trust; limitation to one person shows exclusivity]

**Love:**
[RARE - love is shown through consistent choices, not single action]
"She always asked for Thorne's counsel before major decisions. She checked on him after danger. She let him call her 'Vey' when no one else could."
[Accumulated choices show love better than declaration]

**Betrayal:**
"The guild badge—Marcus's badge—sat on the table between them. Evidence. Accusation. Confession."
[Physical object becomes symbol of betrayal; juxtaposition tells the story]

## Character Trait Transformation

### ❌ TELLING

"Veyra was brave."
"Aldwin was wise."
"Darric was tough."

### ✅ SHOWING (Action Under Pressure)

**Bravery:**
"The assault was overwhelming. Veyra didn't retreat. She repositioned the line, calculated odds, and refused to break."
[Action choices under pressure demonstrate courage, not just stated trait]

**Wisdom:**
"Aldwin didn't offer quick answers. He asked questions. 'What do you feel beneath the fear? Often there is something else—something the fear would hide.'"
[Dialogue and method demonstrate wisdom through question-guiding rather than declaring he was wise]

**Toughness:**
"Darric took the arrow through her shoulder and kept standing. Still standing. The line didn't break."
[Continued function under damage shows toughness; no need to declare it]

## Sensory Bridge Technique

**Problem:** Direct telling feels weak
"She was scared."

**Sensory Solution:**
"Her breath came fast. Too fast. Sweat dripped from her temple. Every heartbeat felt loud enough for enemies to hear."
[Build physical sensation to show emotion]

**Multi-Sensory Cascade:**
"Her throat tightened [tactile]. Her vision blurred at the edges [visual]. She couldn't hear anything but her own pulse [auditory absence]. The cold [thermal] suddenly felt very far away."
[Stacking sensory symptoms creates emotional reality]

## Dialogue as Showing

### ❌ TELLING

"Marcus was apol ogetic by nature."

### ✅ SHOWING (Through Dialogue Patterns)

"I apologize for the confusion. Unfortunately, the regulations require that we follow particular procedures. I regret any inconvenience this may cause."
[Repeated apologies + hedging language demonstrates apologetic nature without stating it]

## Physical Manifestation

**Map Emotion → Physical:**

| Emotion | Physical Manifestation |
|---------|----------------------|
| Anger | Hand to weapon, jaw clench, abrupt movement |
| Fear | Pulse in throat, rapid breathing, freeze/flight urge |
| Exhaustion | Delayed responses, stumbling, staring |
| Grief | Heaviness, slow movement, empty stare |
| Joy | Energy, quick movement, voice lightness |
| Shame | Averted eyes, hunched shoulders, silence |
| Confidence | Direct gaze, steady movement, clear voice |

**Application:**
Instead of "She was exhausted," use one physical marker: "When Thorne asked her a question, she stared at him for three seconds before the words registered."

## Thought as Character Voice

**Don't TELL thoughts:**
"He wondered if they would survive."

**USE character voice to SHOW thought:**
"Would they survive? Probably not. Hopefully long enough to matter."
[Internal monologue shows doubt through structure and word choice]

---

## Time & Repetition

**Show Through Pattern:**
Instead of: "She was devoted to her brother's memory."
Use repeated action/reference: Every morning, she checked the tracking map. Every night, the seven-year marker appeared in her mind. Every confrontation, his name came first.
[Repetition of behavior/reference demonstrates devotion]

---

## Exception: Necessary Telling

**Acceptable telling when:**
1. Internal monologue (character's interpretation of their own state)
2. Retrospective narration (reflecting on past)
3. Establishing baseline (before action proves it)
4. Dialogue content (what character believes about themselves)

**Example of acceptable telling:**
"Veyra was haunted by the fire. Had been for years. The nightmares came less frequently now, but they never stopped."
[Establishes context for later action to deepen; acceptable as baseline]

## Scene Practice

Take a scene with emotional content and audit:

For each "feeling" word (sad, happy, angry, scared, excited):
- [ ] Can it be shown through action?
- [ ] Can it be shown through physical sensation?
- [ ] Can it be shown through dialogue?
- [ ] Can it be shown through choice/decision?
- [ ] Only if NONE of above: Is telling acceptable here?

## Module Integration

- **Load when:** Character scenes, emotional moments, relationship development
- **Combine with:** Dialogue-attribution (dialogue shows emotion through content)
- **Reference:** Character voice profiles (voice reveals emotion/state)
- **Cross-check:** Sensory-grounding (sensory details build emotional reality)
