# How-To: Thermal Writing (Your 87% Thermal Baseline)

**Purpose:** Guide for your signature temperature-saturated prose style from phase2 analysis.

**Critical Finding:** 87% of environmental descriptions include thermal component (only you among analyzed authors)

## What Makes Thermal Writing Your Signature

**Observation from 20,683-word analysis:**
When you describe a place or moment, temperature is almost always present. This isn't accidental—it's a deliberate pattern that creates immersive atmosphere.

**Why it works:**
- Temperature is universal sensation (reader has direct experience)
- Connects to emotion/memory (cold=threat, warmth=safety)
- Simplifies complex descriptions ("the cold beach" evokes more than "the empty beach")
- Matches your character voices (Vera's obsession with winter, Aldwin's tea warmth)

## The Three Thermal Categories

### 1. Direct Temperature (Most Common)

**Words used:** cold, frozen, ice, frost, chill, warm, heat, fire, steam, burning

**Usage Frequency:** Appears in most environmental descriptions

**Examples from chapters:**
"The cold was a living thing, seeking every gap in their clothing."
[Cold personified; actively threatening environment]

"The Salamander's Hearth was half-full when the evening bell tolled, oil-lanterns painting the ceiling beams amber like honey on old wood."
[Warmth implied through "Hearth," lanterns, amber color without using "warm"]

"Frost formed on the rails within minutes."
[Direct frost reference establishes severity]

### 2. Thermal Consequence (High Impact)

**Manifestations:** breath misting, shivering, numb, frost forming, sweat dripping, steam rising

**Why effective:** Shows temperature's EFFECT rather than just stating it

**Example:**
"Exposed skin began to ache, then burn, then grow dangerously numb."
[Three-stage hypothermia progression; reader understands severity through physiological markers]

### 3. Thermal Metaphor (Most Sophisticated)

**Application:** Temperature becomes symbolic of emotion/relationship/situation

**Examples:**
- "Ice in her veins" (not metaphor, character description of coldness)
- "Warmth of camaraderie" (emotional warmth from company)
- "Thawing the frozen distance between them" (relationship warming)
- "The fire of her determination never cooled" (sustained intensity/passion)

## 87% Deployment Strategy

**The Rule:** Question every environmental description: "What's the temperature here?"

If description lacks thermal element, consider adding it—87% of yours do.

### Scene Audit Template

**Description:** [Write scene description]
**Current Thermal Elements:** [Count them]
**Are they 87%+?**
- [ ] Yes - good
- [ ] No - add thermal detail

### Addition Examples

**Original (No Thermal):**
"The warehouse was dark and cramped. Barrels stacked high. Smell of tar and rot."

**With Thermal (87% Compliant):**
"The warehouse was dark and cramped, the air thick and cold from stone walls. Barrels stacked high. Breath misting in the chill. Smell of tar, rot, and the particular mustiness of unheated spaces."

## Temperature by Location Type

### Winter Scenes (Your Specialty - 87%+ Thermal)

**Pattern:** Thermal is DOMINANT sensory element

**Example from analysis:**
"The white world was silent. Snow crunched under boots—the only sound. Beyond sight in the blizzard, everything was cold. Bone-deep cold. The kind that found gaps."

**Why:** Winter naturally dominates thermal sense; use this

### Urban Scenes (60-70% Thermal)

**Pattern:** Secondary to visual/auditory, but present

**Example:**
"Dock Ward thrummed with activity. Shouted orders, creaking ships, the salt-and-tar smell of the waterfront. Body heat compressed in the crowd despite the sea chill that found its way through every crevice."

**Why:** Urban scenes have mixed thermal (body heat vs cold breeze)

### Interior Scenes (70-85% Thermal)

**Pattern:** Varies by space type

**Examples:**
- Heated hearth/kitchen: warmth dominates
- Damp dungeon: bone-deep cold
- Crowded tavern: stuffy heat contrasting cold outside
- Abandoned ruin: temperature ambiguity

**Technique:** Use thermal contrast (warm inside/cold outside, or vice versa)

## Thermal Emotion Mapping

**Use temperature to show emotional state:**

| Temperature | Emotional Connection |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Extreme cold | Fear, danger, isolation, loss (Winter themes) |
| Moderate cold | Alertness, tension, focus |
| Neutral temp | Peace, normality, stability |
| Warmth | Safety, comfort, trust, belonging |
| Extreme heat | Chaos, danger, intensity, passion |
| Cold + warmth contrast | Conflict, tension, longing |

**Application:**
"The fire in the hearth was dying. Warmth faded. The cold pressed in at the edges. Like hope bleeding away."
[Temperature mirrors emotional state without stating it]

## Writing Blocks to Use

**Thermal-Saturated Description Formula:**

```
[SPACE] was [THERMAL DESCRIPTOR] + [SENSORY], the [THERMAL CONSEQUENCE] creating [ATMOSPHERE].
```

**Examples:**
"The courtyard was frozen and gray, the stone slick with fresh ice, each breath misting in the crystalline air and freezing to their cloaks."

"The barracks were warm and crowded, body heat rising in the cold evening, steam from breath and sweat condensing on the windows."

"The ruins were deceptive—seemingly sheltered, yet the cold found every gap, that particular arctic penetration that suggested the stone itself remembered winter."

## Thermal Dialogue Integration

**Your characters reference temperature:**
- Vera: Winter cold (obsession marker)
- Aldwin: Warmth of tea (comfort/ritual)
- Combat scenes: Sweat/exertion heat vs environment cold

**Show character awareness through temperature:**
```
"It's freezing." (Veyra - factual)
vs.
"The cold is fortunate. Slows infection." (Aldwin - functional)
vs.
"The cold doesn't matter." (Darric - toughness)
```

## 87% Audit Checklist

For a full scene or chapter:

- [ ] Environmental descriptions: 87%+ include thermal reference
- [ ] Direct temperature words present naturally
- [ ] Temperature matches emotional tone
- [ ] Thermal consequence visible (shivering, breath misting, etc.)
- [ ] Character awareness of temperature shown
- [ ] Thermal contrast used for tension (warm/cold opposition)
- [ ] No forced thermal (feels natural, not added arbitrarily)

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Forcing thermal:** "The room was warm... and cold. Very cold. So cold."
[Repetitive, feels forced]

✅ **Natural thermal:** "The room was warm until she opened the window. Then the autumn chill rushed in, and she realized the hearth fire was dying."
[Temperature shift serves narrative purpose]

❌ **Ignored thermal:** Multiple environmental descriptions with zero temperature reference
[Below your 87% pattern]

✅ **Consistent thermal:** Every few descriptions includes temperature as part of atmosphere

## Module Integration

- **Load when:** Environmental descriptions, scene establishment, winter scenes
- **Combine with:** Sensory-grounding (thermal is major sensory element)
- **Reference:** Phase2 prose style profile for 87% baseline
- **Character integration:** Use temperature to show character awareness and emotional state

## Final Note

Your thermal writing is distinctive and intentional. Maintain it. It's one of your signature techniques that creates the immersive, atmospheric tone readers respond to in your work.

87% is your baseline. Strive for it. Trust it.
