# How-To: Writing Action Sequences

**Purpose:** Guide for writing combat, movement, and action scenes with measured pacing and authentic prose patterns from phase2 analysis.

---

## Target Metrics (From Phase 2: 20,683-word analysis)

**Sentence Length:** 10-15 words average
**Short sentences:** 45% (under 12 words)
**Fragments:** 15% (for movement urgency)
**Fragment types:** Action verbs as sentence starters, command fragments

**Sensory Focus:**
- **Dominant:** Auditory (sound of movement, impact) - 35% of sensory detail
- **Secondary:** Visual (movement, blur, impact)
- **Tertiary:** Tactile (impact, pressure, weight)
- Temperature often background (combat is intense, active environment)

## Structure Pattern (Authentic from Chapters)

### Opening: Threat Establishment
**Length:** 2-3 sentences
**Pattern:** Movement toward + threat identification
**Fragment usage:** 0-10%

```
They came like a tide of steel and death, and the very air changed
with their approach. The main force struck the gate with coordinated
precision—a proper ram this time, carried by a dozen mercenaries under
reinforced shields.
```

### Middle: Engagement Detail
**Length:** 3-5 sentences
**Pattern:** Action detail + sensory barrage
**Fragment usage:** 10-20%

```
The sound when arrows struck the protective shell was like hailstones
on slate, a metallic drumming that mixed with the rhythmic chanting of
ram bearers. Screamed orders echoed across the courtyard. Blood already
stained the stones.
```

### Climax: Peak Action
**Length:** 2-4 sentences
**Pattern:** Fragment deployment increases, urgency peaks
**Fragment usage:** 25-30%

```
Impact. Crack. The gate shuddered. Two boards split under pressure.
Defenders rushed to reinforce. Chaos. Everyone shouting at once.
```

### Resolution: Clear Outcome
**Length:** 1-2 sentences
**Pattern:** Return to longer sentences, situation clarification
**Fragment usage:** 5-10%

```
The gate held, though barely. For now.
```

## Sentence Length Guide

**Under 8 words (Very Short):**
- Used for: Shock, impact, sudden danger
- Frequency: 15-20% of combat
- Example: "The gate cracked."

**8-12 words (Short):**
- Used for: Action beats, movement, tactical information
- Frequency: 30-35% of combat
- Example: "Arrows whistled overhead as defenders rushed to the breach."

**12-18 words (Medium):**
- Used for: Scene-setting, situation explanation, sensory layering
- Frequency: 35-40% of combat
- Example: "The main force struck the gate with coordinated precision, carrying a proper ram reinforced with shields."

**Over 18 words (Long):**
- Used for: Rarely in action sequences - only for major scene transitions
- Frequency: 10-15% of combat
- Example: "They came like a tide of steel and death, and the very air changed with their approach."

## Fragment Deployment

**NOT Recommended as Pure Fragments:**
- Complete sentences masquerading as fragments (e.g., "The gate cracked." is complete, not fragment)
- Fragments should be INCOMPLETE thoughts

**Recommended Fragment Types:**

**Action-Verb Starters:**
```
Rushing forward, she raised her shield.
→ Fragment: "Rushing forward." "Raised shield." (incomplete thought + action)
```

**Command Fragments:**
```
Move. Hold. Fire.
→ Incomplete commands, no subject specified
```

**Sensory Bursts:**
```
The sound—metallic, urgent, piercing.
→ Incomplete sensory avalanche
```

**Impact Moments:**
```
Strike. Impact. Pain.
→ Single-word action captures
```

## Sensory Delivery in Combat

**Auditory Dominance (35% of sensory detail):**
- "hailstones on slate" (impact metaphor)
- "metallic drumming" (weapon/shield impact rhythm)
- "rhythmic chanting" (ram bearer coordination)
- "screamed orders" (vocal command urgency)
- "crack of wood," "clash of steel," "whistle of arrows"

**Visual Support (30%):**
- Movement blur during active combat
- "tide of steel" (group movement metaphor)
- "arrows darkening sky" (projectile volume)
- Blood, dust, smoke as atmospheric detail

**Tactile Integration (20%):**
- Impact sensation
- Weight of weapon/shield
- Pressure of defending position
- Fatigue accumulation

**Temperature Background (10%):**
- Post-battle sweat/cold
- Blood warmth vs winter cold
- Physical exertion heat vs environmental cold

## Pacing Techniques

**Acceleration (Building Intensity):**
1. Start: Longer sentences, measured pacing (threat approach)
2. Buildup: Medium sentences mix with short bursts (engagement begins)
3. Peak: Fragments dominate, short sentences (maximum urgency)
4. Wind-down: Longer sentences return (situation clarifies)

**Example of Progression:**
```
Sentence 1 (Long, 18+ words): "They came like a tide of steel and death, and the very air changed with their approach."
[Threat established]

Sentence 2 (Medium, 14 words): "The main force struck the gate with coordinated precision, carrying a proper ram."
[Situation developing]

Sentence 3 (Short, 9 words): "The sound was like hailstones on slate."
[Impact registered]

Sentence 4 (Fragment, 3 words): "Metal. Wood. Breaking."
[Chaos established]

Sentence 5 (Medium, 12 words): "Defenders rushed forward to reinforce the failing hinges and mounting damage."
[Resolution phase begins]

Sentence 6 (Long, 16 words): "The gate held, though barely, and for a moment the defenders dared to hope they might survive."
[Outcome established]
```

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **All long sentences:** Loses urgency, reads as explanation rather than action
❌ **All fragments:** Becomes exhausting, loses narrative cohesion
❌ **Over-describing:** Action stops for lengthy sensory breakdown
❌ **TMI on emotion:** "He felt terrified and desperate" instead of showing fear through action
❌ **Weak verbs:** "ran quickly," "hit hard" instead of active engagement
❌ **Losing focus:** Switching POV or attention during action sequence

## Practice Exercise

Take a combat scene (100-150 words) and audit:
1. Count average words/line (target: 10-15)
2. Calculate fragment percentage (target: 15%)
3. Track sensory distribution (target: Auditory 35%, Visual 30%, Tactile 20%, Temperature 10%)
4. Verify sentence length progression (threat → engagement → chaos → resolution)
5. Check for fragment variety (not just single words, include incomplete thoughts)
