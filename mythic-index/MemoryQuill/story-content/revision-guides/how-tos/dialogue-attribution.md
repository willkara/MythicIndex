# How-To: Dialogue Attribution

**Purpose:** Guide for dialogue tags, action beats, and attributionless dialogue from phase2 analysis.

**Target Distribution (From Phase 2):**
- **Action Beats:** 60% of attribution
- **Dialogue Tags:** 30% of attribution
- **Attributionless:** 10% of dialogue

---

## Action Beats (60%)

**Definition:** Character action substitutes for "said," creating dynamic dialogue flow

**Structure:** Dialogue + Action (or Action + Dialogue)

### Dialogue → Action Pattern

```
"We need to move now," Veyra said. She turned toward the gate.
→ BECOMES:
"We need to move now." Veyra turned toward the gate.
[Action shows confidence through movement, not told via adverb]
```

### Action → Dialogue Pattern

```
She checked her weapon and spoke, "Ready to move out?"
→ BECOMES:
She checked her weapon. "Ready to move out?"
[Action establishes readiness before question]
```

### Complex Action Beat

```
"The gate won't hold much longer," Thorne said, his voice tight with concern.
→ BECOMES:
Thorne's hand drifted to his sword hilt. "The gate won't hold much longer."
[Hand movement shows tension; worry is shown, not told]
```

## Dialogue Tags (30%)

**Definition:** Simple tags like "said," "asked," "replied" that identify speaker

**Rule:** Use only when action beat doesn't work

### Acceptable Tags

- "said" - neutral attribution
- "asked" - for questions only
- "replied" - response indicator
- "called out" - distance/volume indicator
- "whispered" - volume/tone indicator (minimal use)

### Tags to Avoid

- "opined," "pontificated," "remarked" (overly decorative)
- Any adverbial modifier ("said sarcastically" - show through dialogue content)
- Unnecessary qualifiers ("he said gently" - let action show it)

### Tag Spacing

**Problem Pattern:**
```
"I'm ready," she said.
"Let's move," he said.
"Now," she said.
[Too many tags, repetitive rhythm]
```

**Solution:**
```
"I'm ready."
Thorne nodded. "Let's move."
"Now." She checked her weapons.
[Mix tags, action beats, attributionless for variety]
```

## Attributionless Dialogue (10%)

**Definition:** Speaker implied by context, no tag or action beat

**When to Use:**
- Clear alternation between two characters (only two speakers)
- Action/context makes speaker obvious
- Builds intimacy (no interruption of dialogue flow)

### Two-Character Scene

```
"Did you see the gate?"
"It won't hold. Three days, maybe four."
"Then we prepare the inner courtyard."
"Aye. And hope it's enough."
[Two speakers only, context clear - no attribution needed]
```

### Group Scene (NOT Attributionless)

```
"The gate is failing."
[Who? In group dialogue, speaker must be clear]
→ Use: "The gate is failing," Veyra said.
```

### Emotional Intimacy

```
Veyra turned to Thorne, their eyes meeting across the firelight.
"I can't lose you too."
"You won't."
[Intimate two-person moment - attributionless enhances intimacy]
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Combat Dialogue

**Use:** Action beats dominate (60%+)
```
"Fall back!" Kelen raised his shield.
Veyra drew her sword. "Defensive positions!"
"Move!" Darric shoved a recruit toward safety.
[Action constantly interrupts dialogue - realistic combat chaos]
```

### Tactical Discussion

**Use:** Tags + attributionless (40% tags, 30% action, 30% attributionless)
```
"The gate won't hold much longer," Thorne said.
Veyra considered the options. "How long?"
"Three days if we're fortunate. Two if they press the assault."
"Then we prepare the courtyard for last stand."
[Mix of tag + action + attributionless for natural flow]
```

### Intimate Moment

**Use:** Attributionless (60%+), minimal tags
```
"I was afraid," she said quietly.
"Of what?"
"That I'd fail you."
Thorne took her hand. "You never could."
[Minimal interruption preserves intimacy]
```

## Attribution Verbs to Avoid

❌ **Decorative:** murmured, whispered, breathed, uttered, exclaimed
[These should be ACTION rather than tag: "She whispered" → "She leaned close. 'Quote'"]

❌ **Impossible:** smiled, laughed, frowned (can't smile while speaking)
[Shows tone through action: She smiled. "Quote." or via dialogue content]

❌ **Emotional Telling:** "he said angrily" (let dialogue show anger)
[Better: "'We NEED to move NOW!' His hand slammed the table." or dialogue content itself]

---

## Dialogue-Heavy Scenes (3+ characters)

**Challenge:** Making speaker attribution clear without overuse

**Solution:** Use combination of:
1. Action beats specific to character
2. Names in early dialogue (establish who's talking)
3. Occasional tags for new speakers
4. Character voice distinctiveness (dialogue itself identifies speaker)

### Example

```
"The supplies aren't enough," Grimjaw said, shaking his head.
Fayne didn't look up from her notes. "Pattern shows 42 personnel consuming
at current rate. We have provisions for 35."
"Then we ration harder." Aldwin offered the gentle observation like a question.
"Already calculated." Fayne turned the page. "Calculated deeper rations for six weeks."
[Action beat + voice distinctiveness avoids tag repetition]
```

## Quick Audit

For every dialogue scene, calculate:
- [ ] Action beats: 50-60% (primary attribution)
- [ ] Simple tags: 25-35% (secondary)
- [ ] Attributionless: 5-15% (intimate/clear context only)
- [ ] No decorative tags ("murmured," etc.)
- [ ] No emotional modifiers on "said"
- [ ] Dialogue content shows emotion/tone

## Module Integration

- **Load when:** Dialogue-heavy scenes, character interaction moments
- **Combine with:** Character voice profiles (for voice distinctiveness)
- **Reference:** Phase2 prose style profile for distribution metrics
- **Cross-check:** Show-vs-tell module (don't TELL emotion, show through dialogue/action)
