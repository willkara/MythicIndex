# How-To: Sensory Grounding

**Purpose:** Guide for integrating multi-sensory detail with authentic metrics from phase2 analysis.

**Target:** ~29 sensory details per 1000 words, with 87% thermal presence in environmental descriptions.

---

## Sensory Density Target

**29 details per 1000 words = approximately 1 sensory detail every 34 words**

### Distribution (From Phase 2 Analysis)

- **Visual:** 52% of sensory details (approximately 15 per 1000 words)
- **Auditory:** 24% (approximately 7 per 1000 words)
- **Tactile:** 16% (approximately 5 per 1000 words)
- **Olfactory:** 6% (approximately 2 per 1000 words)
- **Gustatory:** 2% (less than 1 per 1000 words)

## CRITICAL: Thermal Presence (87% Baseline)

**What This Means:** 87% of environmental descriptions include a temperature or thermal reference.

**Thermal Reference Types:**

1. **Direct Temperature:** cold, frozen, ice, frost, chill, warm, heat, fire, steam, burning
2. **Thermal Consequence:** breath misting, shivering, numb, frost forming, sweat dripping
3. **Thermal Metaphor:** "ice in veins" (emotional), "warmth of camaraderie" (social)
4. **Environmental Thermal:** fog (implies cold), brightness (warmth), shadow (coolness)

**Integration Rule:** When describing an environment, ask yourself: "What temperature defines this moment?" Include that thermal marker.

### Authentic Example (87% Thermal Presence)

```
The cold was a living thing, seeking every gap in their clothing.
[Thermal: "cold," personified as active agent]

It crept through the tiniest spaces between glove and sleeve, found the
one spot where a scarf didn't quite meet a hood.
[Thermal: specific vulnerability to cold]

Exposed skin began to ache, then burn, then grow dangerously numb.
[Thermal consequence: progression from ache → burn → numb showing hypothermia stages]
```

## Multi-Sensory Layering Pattern

**Target:** 3+ senses every ~600 words, ideally woven throughout rather than isolated

### Layering Techniques

**Simultaneous Senses (Same Moment):**
```
The morning breeze carried the acrid smell of oil smoke from their
torches [SMELL], mixing with the copper tang of blood [TASTE/SMELL] and
the sour stench of fear-sweat from both sides [SMELL]. The sound when
arrows struck the protective shell was like hailstones on slate [AUDITORY],
a metallic drumming [AUDITORY] that mixed with the rhythmic chanting of
ram bearers [AUDITORY] and the screamed orders echoing across the
courtyard [AUDITORY].
```
[Multiple senses converging in same moment of chaos]

**Sequential Senses (Rapid Progression):**
```
She heard the gate crack [AUDITORY]. Felt the vibration through the
platform [TACTILE]. Smelled dust rising from the breach [OLFACTORY]. Saw
daylight pouring through the widening gap [VISUAL].
```
[Each sense in sequence as attention shifts]

**Sense-Bridging (One Sense Opens to Another):**
```
The cold [THERMAL] was a living thing, seeking every gap in
their clothing [TACTILE]. Exposed skin began to ache [TACTILE], then
burn [THERMAL], then grow dangerously numb [TACTILE].
```

## Location-Specific Sensory Profiles (From Phase 2)

### Urban Environments (Dock Ward)

- **Sight:** Crowded, layered architecture, fog, dim lanterns
- **Sound:** Multilingual shouting, creaking ships, harbor bells
- **Smell:** Salt, fish, tar, unwashed crowds, cooking spices
- **Touch:** Rough cobblestones, sea spray, press of bodies
- **Taste:** Salt air on lips, metallic city water
- **Thermal:** Sea chill, body heat in crowds, cold dawn fog

### Wilderness (Forest/Winter)

- **Sight:** Dappled light (or white world in winter), layered green/white
- **Sound:** Wind in leaves, silence (winter), crack of ice, branch snap
- **Smell:** Pine, earth, clean cold air, crisp winter
- **Touch:** **THERMAL-DOMINANT** - cold seeking gaps, frost, numb progression
- **Taste:** Clean air, frost taste
- **Special:** Winter = 40% tactile in analyzed scenes (rare high tactile)

### Combat Zones

- **Sight:** Movement blur, peripheral awareness, blood, arrows darkening sky
- **Sound:** **DOMINANT** (35% auditory) - clash of steel, screams, whistling arrows
- **Smell:** Sweat, copper tang of blood, acrid oil smoke
- **Touch:** Impact, blade finding gap, struck, shattered, weight, pressure
- **Taste:** Copper (blood), metallic (adrenaline)
- **Pattern:** Chaos is heard and felt before fully seen

## Sensory Detail Deployment

**Over-Concentration Problem:** All sensory details in opening paragraph → becomes purple prose
**Spread Pattern:** Distribute throughout scene naturally as narrative attention shifts

### Spacing Example (100-word combat excerpt)

**Words 1-20 (Opening):** Visual + auditory (movement + sound)
**Words 21-40:** Auditory + smell (impact + fear-sweat)
**Words 41-60:** Tactile + visual (impact sensation + sight lines)
**Words 61-80:** Auditory again (new phase of combat)
**Words 81-100:** Thermal + tactile (fatigue, heat/cold awareness)

## Avoiding Sensory Purple Prose

❌ **All at once:** "The acrid smoke mixed with coppery blood scent, the harsh metallic clash of steel, the rough stone, the cold biting wind—"
[Sensory overload, loses narrative effect]

✅ **Distributed:**
- Paragraph 1: Smoke and sound
- Paragraph 2: Impact sensation and blood taste
- Paragraph 3: Stone underfoot and cold awareness
[Sensory details woven naturally through action]
